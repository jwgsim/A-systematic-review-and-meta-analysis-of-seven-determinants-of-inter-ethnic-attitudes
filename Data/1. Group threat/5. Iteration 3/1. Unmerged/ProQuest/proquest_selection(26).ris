T1  - Gender/sex diversity beliefs: Scale construction, validation, and links to prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2669413162
AB  - Prejudice against or affirmation of gender/sex minorities is often framed in terms of beliefs about the ontology of gender/sex (i.e., what gender/sex is), or gender/sex diversity beliefs. We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale (GSDB) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the GSDB across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the GSDB and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the GSDB and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the GSDB is a reliable and valid way to measure them.

T1  - When Global Scripts Do Not Resonate: International Minority Rights and Local Repertoires of Diversity in Southern Turkey
AN  - 2628901799
AB  - Under what conditions do global scripts resonate among ordinary people? Neo-institutional world polity theory has tended to sideline this question by privileging macro-comparative explanations of states’ adoption and social movement activists’ framing of global scripts. Adopting a negative case approach, we draw on concepts from cultural sociology to explain why global scripts fail to resonate among ethno-religious minorities in Antakya, Turkey. Antakya has been exposed intensely to global minority rights and multiculturalism discourses; it has been targeted by various ethnic movement activists, and its diverse population has long experienced stigma and discrimination stemming from Turkey’s model of nationhood. Yet, ordinary people there have seldom utilized global diversity scripts in their everyday struggles for recognition. Drawing on longitudinal qualitative fieldwork between 2004 and 2015, we find that global scripts fail to match people’s cultural schemas of perceiving and reproducing boundaries—their local repertoires of diversity—due to a deep-seated ambivalence toward the category of “minority.” This lack of resonance potentially weakens popular support for substantial policy reforms advancing minority rights and is one among several factors explaining why Turkey’s turn from an exclusionary to an inclusionary model of nationhood has remained largely ceremonial.

T1  - Gender/Nationality Intersections in Attitudes Toward Gun Carry among Israeli Citizens
AN  - 2628049711
AB  - The study explores how nationality and gender effect attitudes on the presence, use, and misuse of guns by security forces and civilians in Israel. Using data from a national survey (n = 721), we find that Israelis, Jews, and Arabs have more positive attitudes toward military firearms than civilian gun carry. The vast majority agree that display of military arms increases the public sense of security. Numbers are much lower regarding civilian carry. Most respondents, Jews and Arabs, would interfere if witnessed public misuse of firearms. An intersectional analysis finds (1) a gender gap, men have higher odds of reporting a firearm in the household than women; (2) Jews have more positive attitudes toward firearms than Arabs; (3) Jewish men have more positive attitudes toward civilian carry than Jewish women. This gender gap does not appear among Arabs; (4) Jews are more favorable of self-protection as a justification to use arms than Arabs.

T1  - Detective Effort Among Complainant and Suspect Racial and Ethnic Dyads: An Exploration
AN  - 2598431038
AB  - The gap between citizen perceptions and the realities of police work is most pronounced among detective work: Little, for example, is known about how detectives use their investigative discretion. To overcome this issue within the context of race/ethnicity, detectives reported the amount of time they worked assigned cases. These data were paired with case file information containing the complainant and suspect’s racial and ethnic identity. Dyads of complainant and suspect racial/ethnic arrangements were explored to see whether there was a difference in the likelihood that a case would be worked and for how long it was worked. The results were mixed: There was no difference in the likelihood that a case would be worked or how long it was worked across differing complainant racial/ethnic identities. Cases with a minority suspect, however, were more likely to be worked and for longer periods of time. The implications for these findings are discussed.

T1  - Integrating Canadian Youth: The State of Intergroup Contact, Belonging, and Support for Immigration
AN  - 2620026518
AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey examining 168 immigrant and non-immigrant youth's perspectives of intergroup relations, support for immigration, and feelings of belonging in Canada. Using Allport's (1954) contact theory and the multiculturalism hypothesis (Berry et al., 2021) as a framework, the data is analyzed in the context of relative levels of intergroup contact, friendship, immigration-related knowledgeability, and perceived diversity. This study finds that, overall, the Canadian youth surveyed were more supportive of immigration than older generations and reported high levels of intergroup positivity and frequent intergroup contact. Moreover, intergroup contact and intergroup friendships were positively associated with feelings of belonging, whereas support for immigration was associated with immigration-related knowledgeability and perceptions of diversity.

T1  - Anticipation of Stigma upon Parenthood Impacts Parenting Aspirations in the LGB Community in Israel
AN  - 2564698389
AB  - IntroductionThis study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.MethodsA total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.ResultsLGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood.Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

T1  - Multicultural Education of Autochthons and Migrants in Russia
AN  - 2573029622
AB  - The study aims to analyze modern scientific approaches to multicultural education of autochthons, migrants, and foreign students to assess the real state and prospects of such education development in Russia. The 2019 RPORC (Russian Public Opinion Research Center) survey "Higher education: in Russia or abroad?" was used in the study. A total of 1,600 respondents took part in the study. Based on the Pareto Optimality principle, a model of an integrated multicultural education process has been developed. Survey data analysis has shown that for the majority of Russians (78%) it is not important whether their children/grandchildren will receive higher education abroad. Russian society has a tolerant attitude towards domestic and world educational systems. The practical application of the research results is possible with the improvement of training programs, the exchange of international experience and further research into the problems of multicultural education development.

T1  - Feminist and Anti-Feminist Identification in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century United States
AN  - 2560169354
AB  - Feminism and anti-feminism featured prominently in the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton was the first female major party presidential candidate and self-identified as a feminist speaking openly about the challenges facing women. Clinton faced off against Donald Trump, who was on record making sexist statements and arguing that Clinton’s success was from playing the “woman card”. We ask several questions: who identifies as a feminist today and how is this different from who identified as a feminist in the previous generation? Who identifies as “anti-feminist”? Are anti-feminists simply a mirror reflection of feminists or is it a distinctive social identity? Finally, the study explores the meaning of these labels by looking at what feminists and anti-feminists believe in terms of public policy and attitudes about gender equality. Thus, this study provides insights into the state of modern feminism and antifeminism in contemporary American politics.

T1  - Race talk: How racial worldview impacts discussions in interracial relationships
AN  - 2541701703
AB  - Using a mixed-method approach, this study investigates how individuals believe race impacts their interracial relationship. Two-hundred and three individuals representing diverse racial-gender compositions of relationships responded to a series of measures to assess their Racial Worldview—a collective of notions about racial/ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and recognition of racist hegemony—before indicating the ways in which race or racial issues affect their romantic partnership. Results revealed four distinct types of Racial Worldview through K-means cluster and four broad themes of influences on relationship communication and functioning. Cross-tabs analyses indicated that Racial Worldview and participants perceptions of the impact of race were related with statistically significant differences between those who acknowledge racism and valued group differences reaching different conclusions than those who do not. The results add to existing research by drawing attention to the heterogeneity of thought and understanding within interracial relationships. The promise of using Racial Worldview in future research is discussed.

T1  - Vote Buying in Brazil: From Impunity to Prosecution
AN  - 2504871020
AB  - Os políticos frequentemente compram votos sem serem punidos. O Brasil proibiu a compra de votos por muitos anos, mas processos penais foram raros. No entanto, a pressao popular contra a prática aumentou no final dos anos 90. Mais de um milhao de brasileiros assinaram uma petiçao contra a compra de votos, levando a primeira lei do país de iniciativa popular a ser aprovada pelo Congresso Nacional. Essa lei nao apenas superou os principais obstáculos do processo de iniciativa popular, mas também aumentou dramaticamente os processos por clientelismo eleitoral. A compra de votos se tornou a principal razao pela qual os políticos foram afastados no Brasil, com mais de mil cassaçoes de mandatos. Este estudo examina o papel da sociedade civil e do judiciário na promulgaçao e implementaçao desta importante legislaçao.Alternate abstract:Politicians often buy votes with impunity. Brazil outlawed vote buying for many years, but prosecutions were rare. However, popular pressure mounted against the practice in the late 1990s. Over one million Brazilians signed a petition against vote buying, leading to the country's first law by popular initiative passed by the national legislature. The law not only surmounted key obstacles to the popular initiative process but also dramatically increased prosecutions for clientelism during elections. Campaign handouts became the top reason that politicians were ousted in Brazil, with over a thousand removals from office. This study examines the role of civil society and the judiciary in the enactment and implementation of this important legislation.

T1  - How to Foster Empathy in Anti-discrimination Initiatives? Implication for Social Interventions-A Qualitative Approach
AN  - 2491986183
AB  - L'objectif de cette étude était d'explorer les antécédents de la réponse empathique dans le contexte de la réception des publicités sociales anti-discrimination. Nous avons examiné, par le biais des entretiens de groupe qualitatifs, les antécédents contextuels qui sont susceptibles de faciliter la prise de perspective et le partage émotionnel. 61 personnes ont participé â cette étude, dont 43 femmes et 18 hommes. Les entretiens de groupe semi-dirigés ont duré entre 40 minutes et 2 heures. Les enregistrements ont été transcrits et analysés â l'aide de NVivo. Nous avons effectué un codage mixte des données et nous avons analysé les entretiens selon les principes de l'analyse thématique. Les analyses ont révélé que certains types d'expressions faciales des émotions, deux types de similarité perçue et les éléments mettant en valeur l'humanité commune jouent un röle important dans le déclenchement des réponses empathique dans ce contexte particulier. Bien qu'il soit nécessaire de promouvoir la diversité, nos résultats indiquent que les interventions futures devraient mettre l'accent sur l'humanité commune entre les groupes et la promotion de la diversité devrait étre accompagnée d'un effort équivalent â promouvoir les ressemblances entre les groupes. En outre, les résultats présentés ici peuvent étre utilisés afin de bâtir des interventions plus efficaces et plus appropriées qui cherchent â induire de l'empathie envers les groupes discriminés et marginalisés.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of empathic responding in the context of antidiscrimination public service announcement (PSA) reception. We sought to qualitatively examine which contextual antecedents are likely to play a role in facilitating the perspective taking and emotion sharing processes. Recruitment through the local university's mailing list and an online classified advertising service yielded 61 participants: 18 men and 43 women. Semi-structured focus group interviews lasted from 40 minutes to two hours. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo. We used a mixed approach to coding and analyzed the interviews using the process of thematic analysis. The analyses revealed that certain facial expressions of emotion, two types of perceived similarity and a focus on common humanity play an important role in triggering empathic responses in this type of context. While it is necessary to promote diversity, these findings indicate that future interventions should focus on emphasizing a common humanity between the groups and that the accentuation of differences should also be accompanied by a focus on similarities. The results of the current study can be used to build more appropriate and efficient intervention strategies that aim to foster empathy for discriminated and marginalized groups.

T1  - The Roles of Political Conservatism and Binary Gender Beliefs in Predicting Prejudices Toward Gay Men and People Who Are Transgender
AN  - 2251862004
AB  - Negativity toward gay men and transgender people is pervasive. Past research suggests that authoritarianism predicts biases against transgender people, in part due to an essentialist view of gender. To determine the generalizability of these findings, but with political conservatism as the focal predictor, we re-analyzed Norton and Herek’s (2013) large (n = 2281) nationally representative U.S. dataset. In doing so, we modeled a latent factor indicated by anti-transgender attitudes and prejudice toward gay men to capture prejudice toward gender non-conformists. That is, prejudice against transgender people and gay men on the political right might arise from perceived gender norm violations, which binary gender beliefs could potentially explain. Consistent with social dominance theory, results revealed that those more conservative in ideology were more likely to display prejudice toward gender non-conformists in part due to their greater endorsement of binary gender beliefs. Unexpectedly, and novel to the existing literature, conservatism predicted binary gender beliefs and prejudice toward gender non-conformists more strongly for women than for men. Binary gender beliefs seemingly function as a legitimizing myth to bolster existing hierarchical relations between gender conforming versus gender non-conforming people, particularly among conservative women.

T1  - “We believe, we feel, we act”: Testing the BIAS Map predictions during adolescence
AN  - 2334687032
AB  - The present study examined the relation between adolescents’ beliefs, emotions, and intentional behaviors toward two immigrant groups from the Spanish context: Moroccans and Ecuadorians. For this purpose, we tested the SCM/BIAS Map predictions considering the three‐dimensional perspective of stereotype content, which distinguishes between morality, sociability, and competence. Spanish adolescents (N = 231, Mage = 15.39, SD = 1.09) evaluated either Moroccans (n = 114, 55.3% girls) or Ecuadorians (n = 117, 59% girls) on the SCM/BIAS Map variables. Our results confirmed, for both groups, the validity of the three‐dimensional model of stereotype content and showed that adolescents differentiate between the two subdimensions of warmth and treat them as independent in intergroup evaluations. Furthermore, the mediating role of emotions in the stereotype content‐behavior link was also confirmed but only for the univalent emotions in both groups. Finally, only morality acted as a consistent predictor of adolescents active behavioral intentions. The higher perceived morality of the immigrants increased adolescents’ admiration toward them, which in turn led adolescents to manifest more active facilitation intentions. Likewise, the perceived morality of the immigrants negatively affected adolescents’ contempt toward them, which in turn decreased adolescent's active harm intentions toward Ecuadorians and Moroccans. These findings indicate that the perceived morality of the outgroup is the key aspect in order to simultaneously promote helping behavior and decrease harmful one toward immigrant groups during adolescence.

T1  - The Impact of Interviewer Effects on Skin Color Assessment in a Cross-National Context
AN  - 2431021306
AB  - There is a growing trend in national and international studies to measure respondents’ skin color as a supplement to traditional race classifications. Skin color measurements are often used as an explanatory variable in studies of social and racial inequalities (Bailey, Saperstein, & Penner, 2014; Flores & Telles, 2012; Hutchings, Jefferson, Lewis, & Yadon, 2015; Lerman, McCabe, & Sadin, 2015; Perreira & Telles, 2014; Telles & Paschel, 2014; Telles & Steele, 2012). Given its broad appeal, skin color is now collected in several large-scale surveys, such as the General Social Survey, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the American National Election Studies, and the Latin American Public Opinion Project AmericasBarometer study. There are multiple ways to measure skin color, including reflectance spectrometers, which measure the amount of light reflected on an area of skin. However, for cost and other reasons, many surveys rely on interviewer assessments of respondents’ skin color (Telles & Lim, 1998; Villarreal, 2012). Despite the use of visual aids to calibrate judgments, scholars have expressed doubts regarding the quality of interviewer-ascribed measures of skin color (Hannon & DeFina, 2016; Hill, 2002; Villarreal, 2010, 2012). The extent to which interviewers introduce random and systematic error in skin color analyses is unknown. In this research note, we address these knowledge gaps using the 2010 Latin American Public Opinion Project AmericaBarometers study, a cross-national survey involving 26 countries and over 43,000 respondents. We apply a cross-classified multilevel model to separate interviewer- and area-effects and quantify the magnitude of these effects across countries. Specifically, we address the following research questions:What is the amount of variation in interviewer-ascribed skin color that can be attributed to interviewers and the areas they work in, within and between countries?How much of the between-interviewer variation in respondents’ skin color is explained by characteristics of the interviewer, including their own skin color?What is the magnitude of bias in substantive analyses of the association between Socio-Economic Status (SES) and skin color if interviewer effects are ignored?

T1  - The Conditional Implications of Partisan Loyalty
AN  - 2321132242
AB  - E. E. Schattschneider began his classic book, party government, by declaring that “political parties created [American] democracy” and “modern democracy is unthinkable save in terms of the parties” (1942, 1). Empirically speaking, this statement is difficult to deny: despite railing against the evils of partisanship, the founders of American government ultimately founded the American party system. And while this system has gone through many upheavals, parties remain the organizational workhorse of politics and government (Aldrich 1995). But, normatively speaking, how should we understand the role of political parties in democracy? Are they a wonderful asset? A persistent hindrance? A necessary evil? This is a difficult question because the answer depends on the nature of party loyalty and the institutions that foster it (see Groenendyk 2013). On one hand, party loyalty is indispensable. By binding citizens together and fostering identity formation around a set of policy goals, parties can help overcome the organizational and motivational challenges posed by democracy. On the other hand, these same characteristics also make parties dangerous. If partisan loyalty is blind, then parties can undermine rather than facilitate government accountability. As opposed to helping citizens pursue their collective interests, blind loyalties turn parties into vehicles for demagogues to steer the sentiments of the masses.

T1  - Rights, Inequality, and Afro-Descendant Heritage in Brazil
AN  - 2444306674
AB  - For the past thirty years, the Brazilian government has recognized dozens of sites and cultural practices of Afro-descendant groups as national heritage, including the historical maroon site Quilombo dos Palmares. As this site has gained international notoriety, academic research has focused on the value of this historical landmark for commemorating Afro-Brazilian heritage. This article looks to the ambiguous effects of such commemoration on contemporary people living in the area, some of whom are being forcefully evicted from the site in connection with its heritage status. The article addresses the vulnerability experienced by these residents, as it highlights broader issues associated with multicultural and heritage-recognition policies in Brazil. Specifically, I analyze the policies protecting contemporary maroon descendants and sites to reveal why Palmares residents making claims on their land and heritage fall outside of state recognition. I argue that as these policies have become an increasingly powerful mechanism for protecting Afro-Brazilian and minority groups, they have also acquired the capacity to hurt the most vulnerable individuals within these communities. Two very different types of heritage stand to be protected at Palmares: one of the historical maroons and their contemporary kin, and another of the structurally unequal system that inadvertently replicates the oppression it intends to dismantle. In the context of massive inequality that disproportionately affects blacks, maroon descendants, indigenous, and other minority populations in Brazil, it is critical to consider how political strategies for redressing ethnoracial inequality may also end up perpetuating segregation.Alternate abstract:
Ao longo dos últimos trinta anos, o governo brasileiro tem reconhecido como patrimônio cultural dezenas de espaços e práticas culturais de grupos afrodescendentes, entre estes, o espaço histórico do Quilombo dos Palmares. À medida que este local tem adquirido notoriedade histórica internacional, a pesquisa acadêmica tem priorizado a importância do local no que se refere à comemoração do patrimônio cultural afro-brasileiro. Meu trabalho analisa as consequências de tal reconhecimento patrimonial na vida de populações que residem atualmente nesta região, algumas das quais estão sendo expulsas à força do local, devido à declaratória deste como patrimônio cultural. Analiso também as vulnerabilidades experimentadas por tais populações, no contexto da problemática mais ampla das políticas multiculturais de reconhecimento do patrimônio no Brasil. Especificamente, examino as políticas de proteção aos quilombos e indivíduos quilombolas, e analiso como e por que o Estado não reconhece as reclamações de terras e patrimônio feitas pelos residentes de Palmares. Minha tese é que embora tais políticas venham sendo poderosos mecanismos de proteção aos grupos afro-brasileiros e às minorias, têm também adquirido uma capacidade desproporcional para prejudicar os indivíduos mais vulneráveis daquelas comunidades. Assim sendo, a declaração de Palmares oferece proteção a dois patrimônios muito distintos: um é dos quilombos históricos e seus descendentes contemporâneos, e outro, do sistema estruturalmente desigual que tem como consequência inesperada a replicação da mesma opressão que a própria política visava a desmantelar. Dentro do contexto de desigualdade massiva no Brasil, que prejudica desproporcionalmente as populações negras, os quilombolas, os indígenas e outras minorias, é de suma importância considerar como as políticas atuais que visam à reparação da desigualdade etnorracial também levam à perpetuação da segregação.

T1  - Identity‐centrality, dimensions of uncertainty, and pursuit of subgroup autonomy: The case of Sardinia within Italy
AN  - 2118274308
AB  - Although group‐related uncertainties have been shown to drive subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy, it is unclear whether all group‐related uncertainties motivate subgroup autonomy. We hypothesized that social identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, about one’s subgroup is a key driver of support for subgroup autonomy. We measured Sardinian participants’ (N = 174) relative subgroup (Sardinian) and superordinate group (Italian) identity‐centrality, identity‐uncertainty, and politico‐economic uncertainty to predict support for subgroup autonomy and superordinate group fragmentation. Results showed that subgroup identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, elicited stronger support for subgroup autonomy, especially among highly identified subgroup members. Superordinate group fragmentation was predicted by relatively weaker superordinate identity‐centrality. Results suggest that subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy is driven by the hopes of reducing identity‐uncertainty.

T1  - What Constitutes ‘Discrimination’ in Everyday Talk? Argumentative Lines and the Social Representations of Discrimination
AN  - 2100130068
AB  - Most people agree that discrimination is wrong, but the boundary between ‘discrimination’ and ‘not discrimination’ is often highly contested in everyday practice. We explore the social representations of ‘discrimination’ as an object of study in qualitative interviews and focus groups with both minority (self-identified as BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] and/or gay men) and majority (self-identified as White and/or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Our analysis suggests three repeated and pervasive argumentative lines in social representations of discrimination: (1) that there are two distinct kinds of discrimination (hard vs. soft), (2) that you need to understand the intention of the actor(s), and (3) that a claim of discrimination requires strong evidence. We outline the macro Functions of these resources to argue that each was non-performative: They appeared to be tools to make claims of discrimination, but in practice they were much more effective at making claims of what was not discrimination.

T1  - What predicts anti‐Roma prejudice? Qualitative and quantitative analysis of everyday sentiments about the Roma
AN  - 2051119090
AB  - The present research focused on two primary goals: (a) identifying the content of sentiments about the Roma to which Hungarians are exposed during everyday family conversations, and (b) determining which types of everyday sentiments about the Roma most strongly predict Hungarian respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice. Content analyzing open‐ended responses from a representative sample of Hungarians (N = 505), we found that more than 76% of the respondents reported being exposed to negative stereotypes about the Roma, 27% to threats posed by Roma, and 16% to overt dehumanization of Roma; additionally more than 20% reported hearing no positive sentiments about the Roma in everyday family conversations. We then examined which negative and positive sentiments most strongly predicted respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice (using measures of social distance and modern racism). Higher social distance scores were predicted by a lack of positive sentiments, whereas lower social distance scores were most strongly predicted by unambiguously positive sentiments expressed during family conversations. Higher modern racism scores were further predicted by sentiments expressing dehumanization, threat, and violence against Roma. Together, these results attest to the extremity of anti‐Roma sentiments expressed regularly by Hungarians, and suggest how exposure to specific sentiments may foster anti‐Roma hostility. Moreover, these findings provide guidance regarding the specific negative anti‐Roma sentiments that should be combated to enhance the effectiveness of anti‐prejudice interventions.

T1  - Living without God in a religious country: Polish nonbelievers as a cultural minority
AN  - 2007766867
AB  - This article focuses on the community of Polish nonbelievers; according to different surveys, they constitute approximately 8% of the overall population. In this research-grounded opinion they should be treated as a minority, not only strictly numerically but also culturally, with all the consequences of this fact. This research conducted on the members of this group showed there are some important levels of such consequences. The first is the level of identity. The vast majority of my respondents were raised Catholic and therefore one may call them converts to non-religiousness. The second is the level of (non)religious consciousness. Less than one fifth of my respondents clearly expressed certain forms of religious belief, such as faith in an impersonal form of deity or in an afterlife. The third is the level of subjectively perceived discrimination. Polish nonbelievers rarely meet with direct expressions of prejudice against them during face-to-face encounters. However, they feel a strong social pressure to cultivate some elements of the ritual dimension of religiosity. At the end the author considers to what extent their minority status has a relative character.

T1  - THE USE OF ZINGARI/NOMADI/ROM IN ITALIAN CRIME DISCOURSE
AN  - 2036728006
AB  - This study examines the use of the metonymies zingari/nomadi/rom [Gypsies/Nomads/Roma] in Italian media discourse, in order to critically reflect on their relation to the perception of Roma. The author analyses the frequency of these terms in general discourse and crime discourse, as well as the way they are used in context. The findings reveal that nomadi and rom are used to directly and indirectly index Roma, and have a significant impact on their ethnicisation and criminalisation. In addition, the episodic framing of crime events, combined with the use of these metonymies, erases the Italian government's responsibility for the conditions of Roma in Italy.

T1  - Who Says What to Whom: Content Versus Source in the Hostile Media Effect
AN  - 2506669614
AB  - Hostile-media-effect research has been built on the assumption that partisans are motivated to adjust their evaluations to accommodate preexisting attitudes that are especially sensitive to content. More recent literature, however, has suggested a rival hypothesis—that perceptions of media bias spring from social identity, keyed to source differences. To test these competing explanations, we designed an experiment around the teaching-alternatives-to-evolution controversy. Partisans from two adversarial groups read an op-ed article with manipulations of content (agreeable, balanced, or disagreeable) and source (in-group, neutral, or out-group). Both content and source influenced hostile media perceptions, but nuanced differences speak to the dynamic ways in which content, source, as well as group-level characteristics impact the processing and evaluation of news content.

T1  - Owning Immigration: Messenger Ethnicity, Issue Ownership, and Support for Latino Candidates
AN  - 1949143670
AB  - The public opinion literature stresses the importance of source cues in determining which types of messages affect attitudes and which types do not. Building upon such research, we seek to determine if messenger ethnicity influences how individuals evaluate candidates speaking on immigration in the context of a campaign. Do Americans (and Anglo Americans in particular) view Latino candidates as more experienced, stronger leaders, more trustworthy, and more qualified on immigration than Anglo candidates? Moreover, do such relationships hold regardless of the valence of the message itself? Through an original survey experiment presenting subjects with immigration talk on the campaign trail, we find Latino candidates are reviewed more positively than Anglo candidates when it comes to the immigration messages they speak (especially when it comes to pro-immigration messages). Such findings give us insight into whether or not Latino candidates have the potential to "own" the issue of immigration, as well as offering another path by which Latino candidates can gain a strong foothold with the public in the context of a campaign.

T1  - Losing Wallets, Retaining Trust? The Relationship Between Ethnic Heterogeneity and Trusting Coethnic and Non-coethnic Neighbours and Non-neighbours to Return a Lost Wallet
AN  - 1879382767
AB  - The constrict claim that ethnic heterogeneity drives down social trust has been empirically tested across the globe. Meta-analyses suggest that neighbourhood ethnic heterogeneity generally undermines ties within the neighbourhood (such as trust in neighbours), but concurrently has an inconsistent or even positive effect on interethnic ties (such as outgroup trust). While the composition of the living environment thus often seems to matter, when and where remain unclear. We contribute to the literature by: (1) scrutinizing the extent to which ethnic heterogeneity drives down trust in coethnic neighbours, non-coethnic neighbours, unknown neighbours and unknown non-neighbours similarly; (2) comparing effects of heterogeneity aggregated to geographical areas that vary in scale and type of boundary; and (3) assessing whether the impact of heterogeneity of the local area depends on the wider geographic context. We test our hypotheses on the Religion in Dutch Society 2011-2012 dataset, supplemented with uniquely detailed GIS-data of Statistics Netherlands. Our dependent variables are four different so-called wallet-items, which we model through spatial and multilevel regression techniques. We demonstrate that both trust in non-coethnic and coethnic neighbours are lower in heterogeneous environments. Trust in people outside the neighbourhood is not affected by local heterogeneity. Measures of heterogeneity aggregated to relatively large scales, such as, administrative municipalities and egohoods with a 4000 m radius, demonstrate the strongest negative relationships with our trust indicators.

T1  - Not your average bigot: The better-than-average effect and defensive responding to Implicit Association Test feedback
AN  - 1877776639
AB  - A robust body of literature on the better-than-average effect suggests that people believe that they are better than the average others across a variety of domains. In two studies, we examined whether these better-than-average beliefs occur for bias related to stereotyping and prejudice. Moreover, we investigated the hypothesis that better-than-average beliefs will predict defensive responding to feedback indicating personal bias (e.g., preferences for majority groups, societally endorsed stereotypes). Specifically, we examined defensive responses to implicit attitude feedback. Study 1 examined this prediction using archival analysis of two large, online samples of participants completing a Weight-related Implicit Association Test (IAT). Study 2 conceptually replicated Study 1 using nine different, randomly assigned IATs and additional measures of defensiveness. In both studies, people generally believed that they were less biased than others. Moreover, people responded defensively to feedback indicating they were biased. This effect was moderated by better-than-average beliefs such that feedback indicating societally consistent bias was related to defensiveness most (and sometimes only) when people believed they were better than average initially. This work represents the first foray into examining the possible moderating role of social-comparative beliefs in predicting responses to implicit attitude feedback and spurs several important avenues for future research.

T1  - Digital belongings: The intersections of social cohesion, connectivity and digital media
AN  - 1871585235
AB  - The rapid proliferation and ongoing transformation of digital technologies and social media platforms have had a substantial influence on the participatory cultures of young people and their associated social connections. This social/digital nexus raises important questions of social cohesion, with digital technologies at once augmenting social interaction whilst simultaneously creating an uneven landscape of access for participation. To address this interface of the digital and the social, this paper presents a qualitative study of 24 tertiary students from ethnic minority backgrounds living in Auckland, New Zealand, who use social media. Incorporating a pre-screening questionnaire, a one-week social media diary and semi-structured interviews, this study presents the ways in which digital belongings influence participants' practices of friendship and family. The ways that connective media influence, and even constrain interaction alongside the politics of belongings, are theorised to further examine the meanings and experiences behind participants' social media usage and social contact. By integrating these ideas, this paper presents the ways in which young university students use social media and the extent to which digital interaction and networking influence social participation and social cohesion.

T1  - Narrative discourse in the construction of Mapuche ethnic identity in context of displacement
AN  - 1856412216
AB  - This article examines the ways in which narrative discourse contributes to the construction of Mapuche ethnic identities within a context of displacement and investigates how such identities are negotiated in interactional contexts of communication. The larger study comprised 12 focus groups and 36 in-depth semi-structured interviews with members of Mapuche families living in four comunas (neighborhoods) of Santiago, Chile. For this article, the analysis is based on 12 interviews and six focus groups directed by a native speaker Mapuche woman interviewer and complemented by participant observations of everyday life and ceremonial events in the comunas . From a social constructivist framework, we focus on narrative genres and topics based on their emergence in interaction. Our method is through De Fina and Georgakopoulou's 'Social Interactional' approach, which recognizes the discursive sedimented processes that produce, for example, recognizable genres and themes typical of a group or community. We demonstrate that storytelling has a crucial role in the connections of Mapuche to their southern roots through narrative references to family centered on traditional practices recreated in an urban context.

T1  - Does education 'trump' nationality? Boundary-drawing practices among highly educated migrants from Turkey
AN  - 1807591308
AB  - Inspired by a super-diversity approach, this paper seeks to explore the influence of the 'ethnic hierarchy' of 'old' minority groups over the way 'new' migrants from Turkey negotiate their interaction in the daily life in three settings: Amsterdam, London and Barcelona. By focusing on highly educated migrants from Turkey who by virtue of their country of origin or religion are positioned at the bottom of 'ethnic hierarchies', it strives to understand the significance of these different sources of diversity in daily interaction. Applying boundary-drawing strategies developed for ethnic boundaries, this paper argues that education does not necessarily 'trump' nationality, but allows for substantial claims of difference. New migrants from Turkey carve out a space for themselves by on the one hand homogenizing Turkish or other Muslim communities through attributing 'unwanted' behaviours and on the other re-defining the boundaries of their individual identity with emphasis on different sources of diversity.

T1  - Are Residential and Workplace Concentration Correlated for Immigrants? Evidence for Sweden
AN  - 1811906031
AB  - In immigrant-receiving countries, immigrants are often concentrated in residential neighbourhoods with high concentrations of immigrants. In addition, they are concentrated in workplaces with high concentrations of immigrants. Many researchers have assumed that these are two sides of the same coin, so that policy affecting residential segregation could be expected to influence workplace segregation. Using Swedish register data for 2007, we directly assess whether immigrants who live in residential neighbourhoods concentrated with immigrants also work in firms concentrated with immigrants. We find that there is very little correlation between residential and workplace segregation, suggesting that policy could profitably target both types of segregation separately.

T1  - Construction, Robustness Assessment and Application of an Index of Perceived Level of Socio-Economic Threat from Immigrants: A Study of 47 European Countries and Regions
AN  - 1810721713
AB  - In contemporary globalization, migrations to Europe have accelerated in speed and scale. Over the last decades, there has been an increase in negative attitudes towards immigration, and many studies have emphasized marked differences in the strength of anti-immigrant attitudes among European countries. However, very few studies performed a rigorous statistical assessment of the issue. A new index measuring the level of perceived threat from immigrants is proposed and applied to a data set covering 47 European countries and regions. The results show that Malta and Cyprus have the strongest perception of socio-economic threat from immigrants, followed by Austria, Great Britain, Northern Ireland and Hungary, and that the countries/regions with the weakest perception of threat are Armenia, Sweden, Romania and Northern Cyprus. It is shown that the proposed index has many theoretical and practical advantages over the existing indexes of perceived threat from immigrants. The robustness of the index is assessed using uncertainty analysis. It is very important for policy makers to monitor the level of perceived socio-economic threat from immigrants because negative attitudes towards immigrants make integration difficult and affect social capital, a key aspect of societal wellbeing and economic development. Monitoring is the basis for further political measures aimed at fostering immigrant integration. The proposed index is a useful monitoring tool, an entry point for the ongoing debate on tolerance and can spark further research for a better understanding of the issue.

T1  - Partisan Participation and Ethnic Autonomy: The Case of the Mapuche Organisation Admapu, in Chile
AN  - 1807486428
AB  - This article examines the formation of Admapu - an organisation representing a broad sector of Mapuche society that resisted the actions of the Chilean dictatorship during the 1980s. In political memory, the period of agrarian reform marks a time of hope and strong participation, but here we show how an autonomy project developed within Admapu conflicted with those making political alliances with the Chilean Left. We examine the internal dynamics within Admapu, and argue that at the end of the decade the organisation divided into factions that cemented a rupture with the political system and brought about the formation of contemporary resistance movements.

T1  - Attitudes toward interracial marriages and the role of interracial contacts in Sweden
AN  - 1802366319
AB  - This paper examines attitudes toward interracial marriages and the relationship between the amount of prior interracial contact and attitudes in Sweden. The analysis is based on an anonymous postal survey conducted in Malmö, Sweden answered by 461 white-European respondents. Several studies in the US address the question of contact and attitudes and find that those who have more interracial contact, especially interracial friendships, have more positive attitudes toward intermarriage. The results show that the majority of the white European respondents can imagine marrying interracially; however, there are clear preferences toward different racial groups. Moreover, as in the US context, respondents who reported interracial friendships, and not general or superficial contacts, are more apt to answer the question about interracial marriage positively.

T1  - Protective factors for violence: Results from the Pittsburgh Youth Study
AN  - 1796290127
AB  - The main aim of this research is to investigate risk-based protective and interactive protective factors for violence. The youngest sample of the Pittsburgh Youth Study, a prospective longitudinal survey of 503 boys followed-up from age 7 onwards, was analyzed. Variables measured at age 10-12 were investigated as predictors of an all-source measure of violence between ages 13 and 19. A number of individual (e.g., low hyperactivity, low psychopathic features) family (good supervision, low parental stress), school (high academic achievement, positive attitude to school) and demographic characteristics (older mother, good quality housing) were found to be risk-based protective factors for the various risk groups identified. High academic achievement was consistently found to be an interactive protective factor and was consistently independently related to low levels of violence. Much more research on risk-based protective factors and interactive protective factors is needed so that these can be integrated into developmental and life-course explanations of offending. Also, interventions should be tailored to include knowledge about these protective factors in light of the specific risks that individuals possess.

T1  - 'We've got team spirit!': ethnic community building and Japanese American youth basketball leagues
AN  - 1765125734
AB  - This article examines the role co-ethnic youth basketball leagues play in shaping ethnic community among third- and fourth-generation Japanese American youth. With dwindling rates of Japanese immigration, increased rates of out-marriage, and fewer cultural hubs available, finding a thriving ethnic community has become a particular challenge for later-generation Japanese Americans. Drawing from ethnographic data, I argue that even among highly 'assimilated' Japanese Americans, youth basketball leagues serve as an active space for constructing and preserving ethnic community and social networks. I demonstrate how through social, cultural, and spatial interactions facilitated by sports, some Japanese Americans have found a sense of ethnic 'connectedness' within basketball leagues while performing their own renditions of ethnic identity that is simultaneously attentive to fluid local and global connections. These findings illuminate the role and importance of sport through which Japanese Americans challenges the racial contours of American-ness and belonging while claiming their place, locally, nationally, and transnationally.

T1  - Social Position and Place-Protective Action in a New Immigration Context: Understanding Anti-Mosque Campaigns in Catalonia: IMR
AN  - 1774536630
AB  - This article examines the structural conditions and cultural narratives underlying the high frequency and intensity of anti-mosque campaigns in the Spanish region of Catalonia. Drawing on Blumer's theory of prejudice as a sense of group position, as it has been elaborated and extended to multi-ethnic settings by subsequent scholarship, I contend that local reactions to mosques in Catalonia have been shaped by context-specific configurations of identity and urban space. I show how longstanding socio-economic and cultural divisions within Catalonia's native population, as well as the inscription of these divisions within the spatial ordering of the region, have heightened feelings of threat elicited by the large-scale arrival of Muslim immigrants to working-class neighborhoods in recent years. In advancing this argument, I build on the insights of geographers and urban sociologists to develop a spatially sensitive understanding of social position and perceived group threat that considers the importance of place identities and the interaction between distinct registers of territorial belonging.

T1  - Neoliberalism, criminal justice and Latinos: The contours of neoliberal economic thought and policy on criminalization
AN  - 1771962673
AB  - Since the creation of the prison system, the driving forces of criminalization and penalization have been examined by scholars on the right and left with a focus during the last four decades on what some critics characterize as one of the most influential forces shaping the processes of criminalization and imprisonment: neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is a movement that started in the 1970s and contributed to a sharp increase in poverty, inequality, exclusion and imprisonment. While the influence of neoliberalism has become a central issue in the investigation of criminal justice policy, focusing primarily on race effects, the ethnic experience is yet to be addressed in its totality. Therefore, this article details an alternative perspective for analyzing criminal justice issues as they pertain to Latinos and illustrates a new framework for the influence of neoliberal ideology on the incarceration of Latinos.

T1  - The vicious circle of religious prejudice: Islamophobia makes the acculturation attitudes of majority and minority members clash
AN  - 1790523724
AB  - Public discourse often portrays Islam as the main obstacle for Muslim minorities' integration, paying little attention to the contextual factors hindering this process. Here, we focus on islamophobia as one destructive factor that hinders the mutual integration between Muslim minority and Western majority members, affecting both groups. In Study 1, the more islamophobic majority members were, the more they expected Muslims to give up their heritage culture and the less they wanted them to integrate. In Study 2, only when Muslims experienced substantial religious discrimination did religious identity negatively relate to national engagement and particularly positively relate to ethnic engagement. Together, the studies suggest that religious prejudice in the form of islamophobia is a major obstacle to Muslims' integration because it increases the incongruity between majority and minority members' acculturation attitudes.

T1  - Meaning matters. An empirical analysis into public denotations of the label 'strangers' and their relationship with general ethnic prejudice
AN  - 1773531769
AB  - Survey research on ethnic prejudice often relies on statements focusing on generic labels such as 'immigrants', 'strangers', or 'foreigners'. In this paper we argue that there are, however, good reasons to expect certain heterogeneity in the denotations respondents assign to these labels, and that the specific group respondents think of matters with respect to their response. We tested this assumption by using survey data from Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, N = 1,375) that includes an open-ended question asking respondents which groups they associate with the label 'strangers' (Dutch: 'vreemdelingen'). Content analysis revealed that the ten different meanings people in Flanders give to this label can be organized into four main groups concerning the content of the criterion (nationality, culture, race, no answer/refusal) and two ways concerning how the criterion is used (strangers defined as 'them' versus 'not us'). Regression analyses subsequently showed systematic differences in general ethnic prejudice depending on the meaning of strangers, with people in Flanders who associate strangers with Muslims or people from predominantly Muslim countries reporting the highest level of prejudice. Finally, our data suggests that that the group people in Flanders associate with the label stranger varies according to respondents' socio-demographic background. Not taking into account these different meanings of strangers might lead to an underestimation of the social differences in ethnic prejudice.

T1  - Inclusiveness as Construction of Open Identity: How Social Relationships Affect Attitudes Towards Immigrants in European Societies
AN  - 1764078084
AB  - Studies of individual and group-level sources of prejudice have contributed to today's greater understanding of the emergence of prejudice and discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants. Yet, scholars have claimed that future research should investigate institutional and socio-political macro-level factors affecting individuals' attitudes towards outsiders (Ceobanu and Escandell in Ann Rev Sociol 36:309-328, 2010 ). To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, this article goes across levels of analysis and theories to provide insights about group-level sources influencing attitudes towards immigrants. These sources are taken into account as both institutional and social factors involved in processes of national identity constructions. To this purpose, this work combines Blumer's perspective (Pac Sociol Rev 1:3-7, 1958 ) with both the distinction Weber (Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Tübingen, Mohr, 1922 ) made between open and closed social relationships and some other theoretical contributions that emerged in the field. The findings of a multilevel analysis confirm that, whereby inclusive socio-political factors are involved in the processes of countries' identity constructions, individuals show more positive attitudes towards immigrants. In addition, in inclusive countries, a society's high regard for its own traditions and customs influences individual members to appreciate other cultures and show positive dispositions towards outsiders.

T1  - The Production of Difference and Maintenance of Inequality: The Place of Young Goan Men in a Post-Crisis UK Labour Market
AN  - 1757591701
AB  - This article examines the ways in which young migrant men are constructed as potential employees in a British town where service sector employment, often on a casual or precarious basis, dominates the bottom end of the labour market. Low-wage jobs in many British towns are now constructed as feminized, low waged and demanding personal skills of empathy and servility. In this context, young men, and especially young men of colour, including recent in-migrants, are at a disadvantage, constructed by employers, agencies, co-workers and customers as less eligible workers than 'locals'. We use the experiences of young men from Goa as a lens though which to trace the ways in which expectations and experiences when looking for employment produce a hierarchical division of labour in precarious jobs at the bottom end of the service sector.

T1  - Broadening the mind: Beneficial effects of sojourn experiences and contact with visiting international students on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior
AN  - 1761734788
AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

T1  - Dissimilarity Breeds Contempt: Ethnic Paternalism, Foreigners, and the State in Pas-de-Calais Coalmining, France, 1920s
AN  - 1744618402
AB  - Recently, historians have begun to illuminate further the role that ethnicity played in integrating immigrants into mining societies. Ethnicity, they show, shaped foreign-native relations in complex ways. Migrant culture and local norms both affected the assimilation process. This essay, focusing on France's premiere coalfield of Pas-de-Calais during the 1920s, a period of mass influx of Polish laborers, explores employers' often underappreciated influence over inter-ethnic relations, and it reveals the far-reaching effects of managerial policies. Management's ethnic paternalism influenced, though often unintentionally, relations between Poles and French miners and officials. Employer strategies to manage Poles led natives to see themselves as distinct from and even superior to immigrants. Beyond the workplace, employers used ethnic notions to attract and control Poles, yet in doing so they highlighted the dissimilarities between Poles and Frenchmen. Ultimately, coal companies reinforced foreigners' isolation from local society and roused the suspicions of officials, who strictly policed the Polish community.

T1  - National nostalgia: A group-based emotion that benefits the in-group but hampers intergroup relations
AN  - 1762010133
AB  - Social psychological research on nostalgia has mainly considered this emotion at the individual level rather than the group level. The current paper proposes that group-based nostalgia for the nation (i.e., national nostalgia) is likely to be related to a positive in-group orientation and a negative out-group orientation, because it fosters an exclusionary and essentialist sense of national identity that is based on ancestry and common descent (i.e., ethnic national identity). This prediction was tested in three survey studies. Study 1 was conducted among a broad sample of the native Dutch population, and demonstrated that national (and not personal) nostalgia is positively related to national in-group identification and out-group prejudice. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 among a nationally representative sample of the native Dutch population, and provided support for the mediation by ethnic national identity. Study 3 replicated the findings of Study 2 and additionally demonstrated that national nostalgia positively predicts tendencies to protect national in-group identity, via a stronger sense of ethnic national identity. These findings demonstrate the potential of group-based nostalgia to have positive and negative consequences for group dynamics at the same time.

T1  - How Academics View Conservative Protestants
AN  - 1767330495; 201609096
AB  - A sizable body of research has demonstrated an anti-conservative Christian perspective among academics. Our research explores academics' negative attitudes toward conservative Protestants. We asked academics to rate Protestant Christian groups, and then explain their ratings, how they define mainline, evangelicals, and fundamentalist Protestants, and articulate the differences between various Protestant groups. Identifying as conservative Protestant and intergroup contact with conservative Protestants best predict less antipathy toward conservative Protestants. Analysis of open-ended questions indicates three groups of academics: Conservative Protestant Critics, Theological Definers, and Low Information. Conservative Protestant Critics envision conservative Protestants as intolerant, unscientific enemies to be openly opposed. Theological Definers are fairly supportive of evangelicals and project an image of objective assessment toward them. Low Information respondents do not have much knowledge of or interest in conservative Protestants. Ultimately, symbolic boundaries and lack of intergroup contact reinforce an academic identity that dismisses conservative Protestants for their perceived traits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009: A POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT ON BLACK AND LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES
AN  - 1842827822
AB  - There exists an interesting intersection of political reality in the United States among blacks, Latinos, and whites. This political reality stems from behaviors within the American political economic system which manifest in inequity. This study examines the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on the Black and Latino unemployment. This study is based on the premise that Blacks and Latinos were negatively affected by the Great Recession and its economic phenomenon. A case study impact analysis approach is used to draw conclusions from the data gathered from government documents obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States as a whole and the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, and Los Angeles, California. The authors found that during the Great Recession Black and Latino rates of unemployment were as severe as national unemployment during the early years of the Great Depression, yet the Act was focused on macro-economic issues versus micro-economic employment rates found among Black and Latino communities.

T1  - How Politics Become Personal: Sociohistorical Events and their Meanings in People's Lives
AN  - 1735658463; 201536920
AB  - Major social and political events occurring in adolescence and young adulthood can create politicized identities in particular age cohorts, but within a generation, the experiences and results may differ as a function of different social identities based on (for example) race and gender. We explore the recollections in middle age of experiences in adolescence and young adulthood of four 1968 high school graduates, one from each intersection of race (African American and White) and gender. Most were strongly affected by the civil rights and women's movements, and the Vietnam War-but in ways that reflected both commonalities and distinctive features. The results support existing theories of generational identity and intersectionality, while at the same time suggesting more fine-grained questions for future research.

T1  - Translocal assemblages and the circulation of the concept of 'indigenous peoples' in Laos
AN  - 1752995632; 201600158
AB  - Laos has long been recognized as a country with a high level of ethnic diversity. At present, the government of Laos recognizes 49 ethnic groups and over 160 sub-groups. Over the last couple of decades the modern concept of 'indigenous peoples' has been introduced in Laos, albeit unevenly, partially, and in a quite limited way. The three broadly defined groups that have played important roles in variously promoting the concept of indigenous peoples (xon phao pheun meuang) in Laos are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multilateral banks (the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank), and United Nations organizations. In this article I employ the analytic of translocal assemblages to examine the ways that the concept of indigeneity is circulating in Laos, and drawing on international and local influences. I briefly examine two issues frequently linked to the indigenous politics: communal land titling and bilingual education, and assess the extent to which new indigenous identities are being adopted in Laos. I present an example of how a Hmong group in the USA with links to Laos is constructing translocal assemblages through an indigenous peoples framework in order to resist the government in Laos. Unlike some other countries in Southeast Asia, which have increasingly embraced the concept, the government of Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has not, preferring instead to acknowledge ethnic diversity, but within a framework that recognizes all ethnic groups as equal.

T1  - Local Voting Rights for Non-Nationals: Experience in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium
AN  - 1829550399
AB  - This article explores the impact of local voting rights accorded to non-nationals in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium. The first two countries have some three-decade experience with such voting rights; while in Belgium, the expanded franchise was first exercised in 2006. Drawing on qualitative research carried out in the three countries, the author reviews the rationale for the reforms, the parameters of the franchise and trends in migrants' democratic involvement, including their election to municipal and other representative bodies. In Sweden and the Netherlands, non-nationals' turnout in local elections is generally lower than that for citizens and has tended to decline over time (although there are exceptions, such as the 2006 Dutch local elections in Amsterdam and Rotterdam). Non-nationals' participation in Belgium's two commune elections since the law was changed was low (and dropped slightly between 2006 and 2012). Introducing non-national local voting rights may be making a modest contribution to migrant political integration (including through the election of representatives from a migration background) in the three countries, but other factors, including political parties' recruitment strategies and minority community mobilization, are probably more important. As for lessons that could be applied elsewhere, the author is critical of rules that create obstacles to non-nationals' electoral participation and thus seem to contradict what should be seen as a gesture of inclusion.

T1  - Entitativity and intergroup bias: How belonging to a cohesive group allows people to express their prejudices
AN  - 1700675253; 201525196
AB  - We propose that people treat prejudice as more legitimate when it seems rationalistic -- that is, linked to a group's pursuit of collective interests. Groups that appear to be coherent and unified wholes (entitative groups) are most likely to have such interests. We thus predicted that belonging to an entitative group licenses people to express prejudice against outgroups. Support for this idea came from 3 correlational studies and 5 experiments examining racial, national, and religious prejudice. The first 4 studies found that prejudice and discrimination seemed more socially acceptable to third parties when committed by members of highly entitative groups, because people could more easily explain entitative groups' biases as a defense of collective interests. Moreover, ingroup entitativity only lent legitimacy to outgroup prejudice when an interests-based explanation was plausible -- namely, when the outgroup could possibly threaten the ingroup's interests. The last 4 studies found that people were more willing to express private prejudices when they perceived themselves as belonging to an entitative group. Participants' perceptions of their own race's entitativity were associated with a greater tendency to give explicit voice to their implicit prejudice against other races. Furthermore, experimentally raising participants' perceptions of ingroup entitativity increased explicit expressions of outgroup prejudice, particularly among people most likely to privately harbor such prejudices (i.e., highly identified group members). Together, these findings demonstrate that entitativity can lend a veneer of legitimacy to prejudice and disinhibit its expression. We discuss implications for intergroup relations and shifting national demographics. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Disgust sensitivity predicts political ideology and policy attitudes in the Netherlands
AN  - 1700673653; 201524931
AB  - Individual differences in disgust sensitivity have been linked to social attitudes and ideology, but the generalizability of this effect and the nature of the political issues implicated remain unclear. In two studies using large Dutch samples, we find that disgust sensitivity predicts political attitudes for issues in several domains related to physical/spiritual purity and pathogen risk. Sensitivity to disgust was significantly associated with attitudes for a general 'physical and spiritual purity' factor, as well as specific issue factors regarding sex and sexual minorities, immigration, and foreign outgroups. Additionally, disgust sensitivity was associated with greater likelihood of voting for the socially conservative 'Freedom Party' (Partij Voor de Vrijheid). These results suggest that the tendency to experience disgust influences a specific subset of social and political attitudes across cultures. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Transgender people of color at the center: Conceptualizing a new intersectional model
AN  - 1667948938; 201509476
AB  - Some transgender people in the USA actively experience changes in institutional power linked to transitioning. As such, they serve as informants to the interconnections of institutional inequalities and social identities and positions. Centering the experiences of 'trans' people of color and drawing from feminist standpoint theory, I theorize a multifaceted prism to expand upon existing intersectional models by linking multifaceted social positions to institutional inequalities and challenging dichotomous understandings of categories. I then use this multifaceted prism to critique my own positionality as a researcher and to analyze experiences of trans people of color.

T1  - A STUDY OF ASTHMA AS A SOCIO-ECONOMIC HEALTH DISPARITY AMONG MINORITY COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1757046897
AB  - This study examines the correlation between the disproportionate occurrence of asthma and (1) Minorities and persons residing in Low-Income Communities, (2) The Socio-Economic effect on the United States, and (3) The need for the creation of a National Asthma Law. The overriding theory asserts that in communities where low-income and minority individuals reside, there is a disproportionate exposure to environmental health hazards, which has lead to an epidemic increase in the occurrence of asthma among minorities and persons living these communities. Asthma costs the United States $56 billion each year. Therefore, through policy research, conducting quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as, the inclusion of significant seminal data, this study seeks to raise the awareness of this health disparity and amplify the need for the creation of a national asthma law that specifically address this disparate impact.

T1  - The Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Suicidal Ideation among College Students: A Latent Class Analysis Examining Precipitating Events and Disclosure Patterns
AN  - 1622296346; 201438372
AB  - The aim of this paper was to examine precipitating events for suicidal ideation and how these experiences relate to disclosure in a diverse sample of college students were examined. Among non-Hispanic White students, relationship/academic problems were most associated with ideation. A romantic break-up increased the odds of getting help. Among racial/ethnic minority students, family/academic problems were most associated with ideation and students who reported multiple events were less likely to get help compared with those not reporting events. Future research should examine the reasons for interpersonal conflict among this high-risk group and their attitudes about helpseeking, and identify cultural norms associated with disclosure.

T1  - Effects of Self-Esteem and Ethnic Identity: Acculturative Stress and Psychological Well-Being Among Mexican Immigrants
AN  - 1748865272; 201600242
AB  - We examined whether self-esteem and ethnic identity moderated or mediated the relationship between two types of acculturative stress (American-based and Mexican-based) and psychological well-being among 171 first-generation Mexican immigrant adults. American-based acculturative stress (ABAS) was defined as the stress related to the pressure from Anglo-Americans to improve English and adopt their cultural practices, while Mexican-based acculturative stress (MBAS) was related to the pressure from Mexican immigrants to improve Spanish and retain Mexican cultural practices. The findings suggested that self-esteem was negatively affected by acculturative stress, which, in turn, led to decreased psychological well-being. However, having high self-esteem alleviated the debilitating effects of acculturative stress against psychological well-being. In contrast to self-esteem, ethnic identity exacerbated the negative effect of acculturative stress on psychological well-being. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Race, Space, and Being Policed: A Qualitative Analysis of Residents' Experiences With Southern Patrols
AN  - 1728661213; 201535681
AB  - Research on race and policing has consistently documented the link between race, space, and policing with racial disparities in perceptions and experiences often explained by nature of policing within low-income, distressed communities of color. This study adds a new dimension to past research by examining the relationship between race, racial composition of place, and residents' experiences with southern police across public and semi-public spaces within a middle-class, low-crime, tourism-driven resort area. Using grounded theory methods, this study combines survey data with indepth group interviews and structured observations to reveal variability in participants' experiences with southern patrols. Specifically, African American participants expressed concern for excessive police distribution, differential enforcement, and social exclusion, offering the least supportive attitudes regarding officer demeanor. These findings highlight the importance of using comprehensive measures to access residents' experiences with police and contribute to the understanding of how various geographic contexts might produce racial disparities, highlighting the salience of race in the policing of ethnically diverse public spaces.

T1  - Peer Group Rejection in Childhood: Effects of Rejection Ambiguity, Rejection Sensitivity, and Social Acumen
AN  - 1559006392; 201433430
AB  - This study examined the reactions of 6 to 12 year old children (N = 144) to in-group members who accepted or rejected them, and assessed whether their reactions were influenced by their rejection sensitivity (RS) and social acumen (SA). After completing measures of RS and SA, children participated in an intergroup simulation in which they were accepted or unambiguously versus ambiguously rejected by their group. Findings indicated that whereas ambiguously rejected children understood that they had been rejected, they nevertheless retained greater in-group identification and more positive attitudes than the rejected children, although less than the accepted children. However, as with rejected participants, ambiguously rejected children still opted to change groups whereas accepted children did not. SA children liked the in-group less, whereas those with SA liked the in-group more. Discussion focused on children's selection of peer groups, as well as the effects of their rejection from them.

T1  - Social inclusion through employment: the marketisation of employment support for people with learning disabilities in the United Kingdom
AN  - 1531932753; 201423299
AB  - Employment for people with learning difficulties is considered key to their social inclusion. This contradicts the perceived un-employability of people with learning difficulties that has been part of their social identities throughout their history hitherto. The national rate of employment for people with learning difficulties remains extremely low and has barely changed in the 20 years between 1990 and 2010. This paper investigates links between learning disabilities and employment, drawing on interview-based research. It analyses the quality of experience of the minority in employment to consider whether employment can serve the inclusive purpose expected of it. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - HIV prevention interventions to reduce sexual risk for African Americans: The influence of community-level stigma and psychological processes
AN  - 1692287895; 201523660
AB  - Interventions to improve public health may benefit from consideration of how environmental contexts can facilitate or hinder their success. We examined the extent to which efficacy of interventions to improve African Americans' condom use practices was moderated by two indicators of structural stigma-Whites' attitudes toward African Americans and residential segregation in the communities where interventions occurred. A previously published meta-analytic database was re-analyzed to examine the interplay of community-level stigma with the psychological processes implied by intervention content in influencing intervention efficacy. All studies were conducted in the United States and included samples that were at least 50% African American. Whites' attitudes were drawn from the American National Election Studies, which collects data from nationally representative samples. Residential segregation was drawn from published reports. Results showed independent effects of Whites' attitudes and residential segregation on condom use effect sizes. Interventions were most successful when Whites' attitudes were more positive or when residential segregation was low. These two structural factors interacted: Interventions improved condom use only when communities had both relatively positive attitudes toward African Americans and lower levels of segregation. The effect of Whites' attitudes was more pronounced at longer follow-up intervals and for younger samples and those samples with more African Americans. Tailoring content to participants' values and needs, which may reduce African Americans' mistrust of intervention providers, buffered against the negative influence of Whites' attitudes on condom use. The structural factors uniquely accounted for variance in condom use effect sizes over and above intervention-level features and community-level education and poverty. Results highlight the interplay of social identity and environment in perpetuating intergroup disparities. Potential mechanisms for these effects are discussed along with public health implications.

T1  - The Ethnic Russians - Scattered in Geo-cultural and Semantic Spaces of Kyrgyzstan - Minorities, Diasporas or Depleting Historical Resource? Back to the History of the Issue
AN  - 1684423651; 201518425
AB  - The current status of the Russian language in modern Kyrgyzstan is vague and precarious. Historically, Russians and the Russian language have been a backbone of Kyrgyz culture that paved the way for an unprecedented rise in literacy and a socio-economic upswing in this small mountainous country during Communism. However, post-Soviet times have witnessed an advent of revisionist tendencies in rethinking of the Communist past where Russians and their language are implicitly associated with historical injustices towards titular nations. Russian lingua franca as a means of inter-ethnic communication has become a source of controversy and a matter of debates. The Kyrgyz are divided along the lines of those politically-motivated public figures, who seek to exploit the status of the Russian language in their election campaigns. A package of laws providing exclusive use of Kyrgyz language in office and administration has been recently adopted in an attempt to place limits on the Russian language. These developments are widely regarded as discriminative towards not only Russian but also other minority languages in the country. On the other hand, the overwhelming majority of Kyrgyz intellectuals still hold a strong view that Russians and the Russian language deserve better in Kyrgyzstan. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Aging Out: A Qualitative Exploration of Ageism and Heterosexism Among Aging African American Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1504423493; 201405554
AB  - African Americans elders, like their non-African American counterparts, are not a homogeneous group; however an early characteristic placed on all African Americans is in their shared history in the United States. As members of multiple minority groups, older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people of African descent have survived racism, heterosexism, homophobia, and now ageism. This article describes a qualitative study grounded in Black feminist and minority stress theories that explored the issues of perceived social discrimination and alienation of 15 older African American lesbians and gay males whose lived experiences were captured using in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Several themes were identified in the study, including (a) Sense of Alienation in the African American Community, (b) Deliberate Concealment of Sexual Identity and Orientation, (c) Aversion to LGBT Labels, (d) Perceived Discrimination and Alienation From Organized Religion, (e) Feelings of Grief and Loss Related to Aging, (f) Isolation, and (g) Fear of Financial and Physical Dependence. The implication of the findings suggests that the ethos and needs of older African American lesbian women and gay men need to be addressed to eliminate potential barriers to successful aging for this cohort.

T1  - Essentialism, historical construction, and social influence: Representations of Pomakness in majority talk in Western Thrace (Greece)
AN  - 1541997723; 201426792
AB  - Social psychological research has been particularly interested to study essentialism in the construction of social categories and to manifest its potential consequences in intergroup attitudes. Drawing upon this literature, the present study focuses on the argumentative resources employed to construct ethnic categories in a specific rhetorical context: focus group discussions between majority Greek educators about the minority group of Pomaks, historically residing in Western Thrace (Greece). Discussions were framed as an attempt to capture the particularities of minority education and data were analysed by the use of tools and concepts of discursive and rhetorical psychology. Analysis indicates that participants have multiple and complex recourses available to construct Pomakness. Representations of Pomakness as an essential a-historical entity coexist with conceptions of category membership and identification as a result of certain historical conditions and processes of social influence. Essential and de-essential category constructions are approached as rhetorically situated, oriented towards specific rhetorical ends in specific argumentative contexts. They are also considered, however, to be nested within a complex and dynamic intergroup context which reflects the ideological contradictions of the Greek policy towards the minority and which constitutes (but it is also reconstituted by) shifting group definitions and boundaries.

T1  - Whither multiculturalism? Global identities at a cross-roads
AN  - 1559007622; 201432145
AB  - Technological advancement and the quantum leap in global trade had enabled many countries to enter an era of multiculturalism where intergroup contact with members of another ethno-cultural community is the norm rather than the exception. While this phase of economic development is considered progressive by many, it is also regarded as a perilous stage in nation building. Immigration, acculturation, and intergroup tensions will form the nexus of all future contestations with the various social groups negotiating with and/or vying against one another for political rights and status. At the same time, the notion of culture has become increasingly blurred given the multiplicity and interwoven nature of social identity arising from the transnational human movement and the transmission of values. With these considerations in mind, this chapter explores and extrapolates the emerging fabric of multiculturalism across various continents using a historical, socio-political, and psychological lens. Contemporary acculturation and intergroup frameworks are re-visited with the aim to discover new theoretical insights, while keeping in mind the possible trajectory of multiculturalism and how diversity will be managed in the decades to come.

T1  - Perceiving race relevance in everyday events: Target race matters, perceiver race does not
AN  - 1504422866; 201405290
AB  - Perceptions of the relevance of race in everyday situations may matter for intergroup relations. Extending previous research, this work examines Blacks' and Whites' perceptions of race relevance in positive versus negative everyday situations affecting Black or White individuals. It also examines whether Black and White participants expect more intergroup disagreement regarding those perceptions than actually exists (i.e., interracial pluralistic ignorance). In Study 1, White participants saw significantly more race relevance in negative situations affecting Black (rather than White) individuals, whereas positive events seemed only marginally more race relevant when they featured Blacks. Study 2 replicated this pattern among White and Black participants. Furthermore, Study 2 uncovered interracial pluralistic ignorance: both Black and White participants expected to agree with their racial ingroup more than their racial outgroup, even though both groups reported similar race relevance perceptions. Participants' own race relevance ratings and symbolic racist attitudes moderated the degree of expected disagreement. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Extending Contact Across Generations: Comparison of Direct and Ancestral Intergroup Contact Effects on Current Attitudes Toward Outgroup Members
AN  - 1494749690; 201401937
AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that intergroup relations are affected not only by direct contact with outgroup members, but also by extended contact: the mere knowledge that an ingroup member has a positive relationship with an outgroup. The present article focuses on the transgenerationally transmitted effects of contact, namely the impact of knowledge about ancestors' contact with outgroup members on descendants' attitudes toward the outgroup. A correlational study in the Polish-Ukrainian borderland region (N = 288) shows that ancestral intergroup contact -- independently from direct intergroup contact -- plays a crucial role in the process of improving intergroup attitudes. The mediating mechanisms of perceived similarity of the outgroup to the self and of perspective taking are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The Ethnic Dimensions of Suburbanisation in Estonia
AN  - 1364702611; 201323597
AB  - Large-scale suburbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon in East Central Europe and is responsible for major socio-spatial changes in metropolitan areas. Little is known about the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation, despite the existence of often sizeable Russian minority populations in some member-states of the former Soviet Union. We use individual-level Estonian census data from the year 2000 in order to investigate the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation. The results show that ethnic minorities have a considerably lower probability of suburbanising compared to the majority population, and minorities are less likely to move to rural municipalities-the main sites of suburban change-in the suburban ring of cities.

AB  - This study systematically explores the factors that affect collective identity associations within the Alevi community in Turkey by employing the social identity approach and examining survey data collected through fieldwork. The results show that Kurdish Alevis express lower levels of attachment to their religious identity as compared to Turkish Alevis. The results also indicate that personal experiences of discrimination tend to increase one's prioritization of Alevi identity. Last, no significant differences are observed regarding group identity between Alevis who reside in urban areas and those who live in rural areas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National Narrative and Social Psychological Influences in Turks' Denial of the Mass Killings of Armenians as Genocide
AN  - 1347783757; 201322436
AB  - This article sheds light on the nature of the Turkish denial of Armenian mass killings. A survey study investigates Turkish students' construals (i.e., attributions of responsibility and perceived severity of harm) of Turkish massacres of Armenians at the beginning of the 20th century. The results demonstrated a high correspondence between participants' individual construals and the Turkish official narrative of the events. Structural equation modeling indicated that in-group glorification, perceived in-group threat, and positive attitudes toward war predicted less acknowledgment of in-group responsibility, which in turn predicted less support for reparations of the harm inflicted on Armenians. The study highlights the influence of government-sponsored national self-images in the production and endorsement of legitimizing narratives of the in-group's violence. The findings call for research that examines the combined influence of psychological and societal mechanisms on people's beliefs about in-group actions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - AN INCONVENIENT BIRTH
AN  - 1347783126; 201318658
AB  - This article reconstructs the history of the nationalist movement among the Dusunic peoples also known as Kadazandusun in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and its demise following the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. It analyses how the 'Kadazan nationalists' elaborated a modern, objectified culture based on cultural traits, symbols and traditions of rural peoples and used print media and local radio to spread it. When the Dusunic peoples were integrated as a minority in Malaysia, the nation builders acquired control of all the main media and excluded their languages and culture. The article then analyses the dynamics of the struggle between the ethnic group and the central government as reflected in cultural production, language development and loss, and in ethnic naming. While these issues reveal competition between various native elites they have nevertheless allowed the growth of a sense of belonging to a Dusunic ethnic group, however named.

T1  - Does Circular Migration Lead to "Guest Worker" Outcomes
AN  - 1315601675; 201307538
AB  - At first at the level of the European Commission, and increasingly also in the European Union's member states, it is being recognized that past labour migration management tools have more or less serious drawbacks in that they produce undesired outcomes and do not sufficiently attain the objectives for which they were designed. The welfare states of north-western Europe are discovering that their desire of the past three decades to restrict labour immigration as much as possible is no longer "in sync" with changing labour market demands, which are growing both for the highly skilled and the unskilled. In order to satisfy the demand for unskilled labour, schemes are being proposed that would allow for circular migration. The European Commission is a forceful promoter of these schemes. Member states such as the Netherlands, which we take as a case in point, are also considering modes by which to allow temporary unskilled labour migration, but seem intent on employing regulatory tools that are not very different from those used in the "guest worker" era, which brought about large-scale settlement. Up to the present time, the resulting ethnic minority groups are the subject of large integration efforts on the part of the receiving states. This begs the question of the extent to which "circular migration" would be different from "guest worker" schemes, in its management and its outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Making Money, Marking Identities: On the Economic, Social and Cultural Functions of Moroccan Weddings in Brussels
AN  - 1551001433; 201429021
AB  - This article focuses on the weddings of second-generation Moroccans in Belgium. These unique, festive events give rise to a niche economy in which Moroccan entrepreneurs supply specific goods and services like the caftan-a traditional ceremonial dress for women. By linking qualitative and quantitative data with theoretical insights, this research relates these commercial activities with the Moroccan migrant community, which is inwardly torn apart by acculturation and individualisation. Therefore the growing social discord between generations and genders needs to be compensated by unifying rituals and symbols. Although traditional at first sight, the wedding ceremony and the caftans are, rather, a reinvention by a community searching for ethnic identity markers that can help it to embrace all its descendants. Instead of merely replicating the home country, this 'translocation' of culture is creating new common ground in the host society, thus showing that transnationalist and assimilationist ideas can sometimes link up in a dialectical way.

T1  - Prejudicial behavior: More closely linked to homophilic peer preferences than to trait bigotry
AN  - 1417524791; 201332089
AB  - We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.

T1  - Evolving Issues of Integration and Inequality Among Middle Class Minorities
AN  - 1266146556; 201300462
AB  - Over the past half century, racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have made significant socioeconomic progress. The expansion and influence of "middle-class minorities" is attributable to absolute and relative gains across a range of socioeconomic outcomes. For instance, despite meaningful differences by national origin, median household income among Asians now exceeds that among Whites (Beeghley, 2008; Kerbo, 2009; Massey, 2007). The percentage of second-generation Latinos (including Mexicans and Central Americans) working in white-collar jobs has not only substantially increased, but in some cases now exceeds that for Whites (Alba & Nee, 2003). And whereas the percentage of Black and White high school graduates is now comparable, the percentage of African Americans who have completed a college degree and/or earned an advanced degree has doubled since 1965 (Hacker, 2003; Landry & Marsh, 2011; Stoll, 2005).

T1  - Collective regret versus collective guilt: Different emotional reactions to historical atrocities
AN  - 1315600217; 201307382
AB  - A distinction between guilt and regret in reactions to in-group atrocities is proposed. Four studies (total N = 1249) support the notion that guilt and regret are distinct emotional reactions. Whereas guilt is a self-focused, aversive emotional reaction following from appraisals of responsibility and associated with the intention to make amends, regret follows from an empathic victim perspective, is less aversive, and is more strongly associated with positive attitudes towards the victim groups and the intention to engage in intergroup contact. These findings suggest that less aversive emotions like regret are more likely to improve intergroup attitudes after a common history of conflict, but the aversive experience of guilt might be more potent in motivating reparations.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in Family Stress Processes Among African-Americans and Black Caribbeans
AN  - 1417527169; 201331911
AB  - Several theories of stress exposure, including the stress process and the family stress model for economically disadvantaged families, suggest that family processes work similarly across race/ethnic groups. Much of this research, however, treats African-Americans as a monolithic group and ignores potential differences in family stress processes within race that may emerge across ethnic groups. This study examines whether family stress processes differ intraracially in African-American and Black Caribbean families. Using data from the National Survey of American Life, a national representative data set of African-American and Black Caribbean families, we assess the extent to which parents' stress appraisals and psychological adjustment are related to their adolescent children's stress appraisals, psychological adjustment, and depressive symptoms. Our study illustrates that stress processes differ by ethnicity and operate through varying pathways in African-American and Black Caribbean families. The implications of intraracial variations in stress processes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Islamophobia and Threat Perceptions: Explaining Anti-Muslim Sentiment in the West
AN  - 1188305855
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. Starting from the premise that Islamophobic attitudes are more nuanced than a simple dislike of Muslims, I focus on specific forms of attitudes which link Muslims to violence and terrorism. Data from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys are used to test three theories: perceived threat, social identity, and cognitive capabilities. A series of logit estimations are used for the empirical analysis of individual level data in the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. The results show that perceived realistic and symbolic threat is the most significant source of Islamophobic attitudes in the West. While individuals cognitively differentiate between general feelings toward Muslims and their specific characteristics, higher levels of education significantly reduces negative sentiments. A good number of Westerners think of Muslims as violent individuals while some believe that they support al-Qaeda. Citizens in the West are more likely to associate Muslims with terrorism if they feel threatened by their physical and cultural existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Determinants of Local People's Perceptions and Attitudes Toward a Protected Area and Its Management: A Case Study From Popa Mountain Park, Central Myanmar
AN  - 1322723350; 201314003
AB  - The attitudes and perceptions of local people are important for long-term survival of protected areas. Some studies have shown that people's perceptions and attitudes are shaped by knowledge about protected area goals and characteristics and related to socioeconomic factors. In this study, socioeconomic status, knowledge of protected area characteristics, perceptions of benefits and costs of protected areas, and attitudes toward two management programs were examined for people in 208 households from 14 villages around Popa Mountain Park, Central Myanmar. Approximately 50% of respondents had basic knowledge about the park; 38% perceived benefits and 45% perceived losses due to the park. Approximately half held positive attitudes toward buffer zone establishment and replacement of banana plantations. Logistic regression revealed that perceptions of benefits and positive attitudes toward management were correlated with both sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge, while perceptions of losses and negative attitudes toward management were influenced by economic concerns.

T1  - Unlocking the racialized and gendered educational experiences of South Asian females in Hong Kong: the case study of Pakistani girls
AN  - 1283641294; 201303459
AB  - Educating South Asians with different language and cultural backgrounds and integrating them into mainstream society have been a challenge for the educational system of Hong Kong. This study documents the educational experiences of a group of Pakistani girls in the contexts of home, community, and school in Hong Kong. Using ethnographic methods, data collection is based on interviews evoking their life stories. These stories recount how Pakistani girls attempt to negotiate with traditional customs, religion and mainstream stereotypes and to construct racialized and gendered schooling experiences. This study highlights the importance of mainstream engagement in regard to critical learning about cultural and linguistic diversity. It is claimed that minorities have an active role as agents in social transformation and change in achieving racial and gender equality, in this case for the most disadvantaged minority females, within the asymmetrical power relationships between local Chinese and South Asian minorities in Hong Kong.

T1  - Explaining Attitudes Towards Immigration Policies in European Countries: The Role of Human Values
AN  - 1347781745; 201318706
AB  - European societies have been experiencing increasing rates of immigration in recent decades. At the same time one can observe a substantial rise in anti-foreigner sentiments. In this study we investigate the effect of human values on attitudes towards immigration. We hypothesise that self-transcendent individuals are more supportive of, and conservative individuals are more adverse to, immigration. We do not expect large differences in the effect of values across contexts. To explain cross-country and cross-time differences we use group threat theory, according to which larger inflows of immigration combined with challenging economic conditions impose a threat on the host society, resulting in more negative attitudes towards immigration. To test our hypotheses we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-03, 2004-05 and 2006-07) and multilevel analysis. Prior to the interpretation of the results, we guarantee that the concepts display measurement invariance across countries and over time. Our results largely confirm our hypotheses regarding the role that values play in the explanation of anti-immigration attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic identification in response to perceived discrimination protects well-being and promotes activism: A longitudinal study of Latino college students
AN  - 1023026789; 201223676
AB  - Using structural equation modeling and cross-lagged analyses, this longitudinal study investigates ethnic identification, a group-based coping strategy, as a mediator of the influence of perceived discrimination on psychological well-being and willingness to engage in activism on behalf of one's ethnic group among Latino students in both their first and fourth years of college. We found cross-sectional evidence for the rejection-identification model (RIM) during both years of college. Further, multiple step bootstrapping analyses of the longitudinal data showed that the relationships between perceived discrimination during Year 1 and both well-being and activism during Year 4 were sequentially mediated by activism during Year 1 predicting ethnic identification during Year 4. These data extend the RIM by including activism as an additional outcome variable that has important implications for Latino students across time.

T1  - White cruelty or Republican sins? Competing frames of stigma reversal in French commemorations of slavery
AN  - 1037875371; 201231060
AB  - This paper explores how French activists use claims about the history and legacies of slavery to combat stigmas associated with their group membership. Using a case study of a French Caribbean association (CM98) and a pan-African association (COFFAD), I examine how two organizations produce competing models for challenging and reversing the stigma of slavery. Through a process of normative inversion, activists assert the moral inferiority of dominant groups. CM98 rejects both a racial and an African identity, and seeks recognition for 'French descendants of slaves', using the language of citizenship to criticize the French government. COFFAD, by contrast, asserts an Afro-centric black identity and stigmatizes white Europeans. I argue that both destigmatization strategies unwittingly reinforce the stigma of historical enslavement.

T1  - Diversity Is in the Eye of the Beholder: How Concern for the In-Group Affects Perceptions of Racial Diversity
AN  - 925713861; 201204234
AB  - The reported studies suggest that concern for the in-group motivates Asian Americans and African Americans to define diversity specifically, that is, as entailing both minorities' numerical and hierarchical representation, while motivating White Americans to define diversity broadly, that is, as entailing either minorities' high numerical and/or hierarchical representation in an organization. Studies 2-4 directly assess if a concern for the in-group affects conceptions of diversity by measuring Black and White participants' racial identity centrality, an individual difference measure of the extent to which individuals define themselves according to race. These studies suggest that the tendency to conceive diversity in ways protective of the in-group is especially pronounced among individuals who identify strongly with their racial in-group.

T1  - What does it mean to be human? How salience of the human category affects responses to intergroup harm
AN  - 1018342779; 201212781
AB  - Two studies explore how salience of the human category influences responses to intergroup harm and how different images of humanity modify these effects. In Study 1, British participants (n = 86) contemplated acts of terrorism against their group. When the human category (versus intergroup distinctions) was salient and when the prevailing image of humanity was malevolent (versus benevolent), participants were not only more understanding of terrorism, blamed this less on religious group memberships, but also more strongly endorsed the use of extreme force by countries to defend their boarders, preserve the peace and prevent future attacks. In Study 2, British participants (n = 83) contemplated the torture of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. When the human category was salient and the prevailing image of humanity was malevolent, participants experienced less guilt and justified torture more. We conclude that the effects of human category salience on interpretations of intergroup harm depend on what it means to be human. When human nature is perceived negatively, thinking in terms of the human category can normalise intergroup harm regardless of whether the outgroup or the ingroup is the perpetrator. Implications for re-categorisation approaches to conflict reduction are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 907928737; 201124757
AB  - Between 1901 and 1913, Norwegian women won a series of legislative victories, including the universal right to vote. To Norwegian Americans, these events held special meaning. They represented verifiable and contemporary proof of what Norwegian Americans had been arguing for some time: namely, that their homeland was a bastion of progress and democracy and that they had carried this particular legacy to the New World. Many argued that as Norwegian Americans, they were committed to modern, forward-looking ideas and democratic principles, thereby making them model citizens in their adopted home. Women's suffrage advocates also used this particular rhetorical emphasis to substantiate their claims that Norwegian Americans had a duty to support women's suffrage based on their cultural connection to progress and equality. A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the United States that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups, including the Irish and the Italians, struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the United States. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were -- as all others -- keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. An investigation into the particular case of Norwegian Americans living in Minnesota and North Dakota reveals an intriguing relationship between Norwegian American cultural arguments that asserted a common ethnic past and women's suffrage debates. This article seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the United States.

T1  - New majorities' abuse of power: Effects of perceived control and social support
AN  - 1910239647
AB  - Two studies examined how new majorities (minorities-turned-majorities) abused power by claiming privileges (in-group favoritism) and disparaging new minorities (out-group hostility). Study 1 found that new majorities low in perceived control showed significantly more in-group favoritism than new majorities high in perceived control and stable majorities. The effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism was mediated by certainty about status stability. Study 2 replicated the effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism. In addition, Study 2 found that new majorities were most likely to engage in out-group hostility when they were low in perceived control and received social support for such discrimination. Our studies suggest that power abuse is most egregious among minorities who rise to majority status without a sense of control in the context where abuse is socially endorsed.

T1  - Evolution of parochial altruism by multilevel selection
AN  - 1030866760; 201229577
AB  - The evolution of parochial altruism is not well understood. We study this problem by considering a prisoner's dilemma game with four strategies: altruists who cooperate with everyone; parochialists who only cooperate with members of their own group; traitors who only cooperate with outgroup individuals; and egoists who never cooperate. We develop a model that allows for both assortment and conflict between groups. Individuals discriminate between in- and outgroup members. While assortment and conflict allow for the evolution of both indiscriminate and parochial altruism, discriminate behavior creates an advantage for parochialists over altruists, as the latter waste help on outgroup members. We use computer simulations to study the multilevel selection dynamics. The simulation model describes an absorbing Markov chain. We examine the absorption probabilities of altruists and parochialists. Three model versions are compared, with only assortment, with only group conflict, and with both mechanisms. We find that parochialism is selected for by group conflict as well as assortment. Discrimination allows for cooperation inside groups to withstand regular interactions with outgroup members.

T1  - Racism as a Predictor of Psychological Distress in a Sample of Trinidadian College Students
AN  - 914768013; 201200192
AB  - This study is an investigation of race-related stress as a predictor of psychological distress and self-esteem among Afro-Trinidadians, Indo-Trinidadians and Trinidadians of mixed ancestry. One hundred seventy-eight Trinidadian participants from a university sample completed the Index of Race-Related Stress (IRSS)-Brief version, the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised, and the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory. Analysis of variance revealed that though self-esteem did not vary among the Trinidadian racial groups, indications of psychological distress varied widely. Results from multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived institutional racism did not predict self-esteem, but it significantly predicted psychological distress. In addition, each of the three race-related stress variables (i.e., individual racism, institutional racism, and cultural racism) suggested significant differences among the three racial groups. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of race relations in Trinidad. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Latinos in the US and Spain: demographics, designations and political identities
AN  - 902083206; 201122278
AB  - Hispanic, Spanish speaking or Latino residents are a strong force in international migration; the influence in the societies in which they reside is seldom questioned. This article reviews the nature of the Latino group (immigrants and native born) in two countries, Spain and the US, the names through which they are known, their countries of origin, and their individual and group identities. The strength, demographics, and political organization of their collectives are also addressed, as is the citizenship status of the members in the host society. These issues are important for social workers who need to understand the nature of modern Latino or Latin-American immigration to address services to them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Challenging Democracy: Ethnicity in Postcolonial Fiji and Trinidad
AN  - 907927367; 201124762
AB  - Fiji and Trinidad are similar in terms of their colonial and postcolonial historical experiences, yet their political outcomes are different. The argument put forth is that constitutional reforms that were adopted by Fiji were unsuccessful because of systemic conditions specific to the country. Sustained by structural features such as land rights and chiefly jurisdiction, and more intangible factors such as cultural identity and nationalism, ethnic identity is the lens through which most public discourse occurs. By contrast, Trinidad does not have these corresponding institutional structures, and the existence of public spaces for the contestation of ethnic identities together with the construction of hybrid identities at the local and national levels have contributed towards political stability.

T1  - Predicting support for racial transformation policies: Intergroup threat, racial prejudice, sense of group entitlement and strength of identification
AN  - 862596795; 201109539
AB  - Policies and programs designed to challenge the effects of racial discrimination (such as affirmative action) are hotly contested. Factors which have been proposed to explain opposition to these policies include racial prejudice, group threat and self-interest, and perceptions of intergroup justice. We report the results of two random national telephone surveys which tested a theoretically based model of the predictors of policy support in post-apartheid South Africa. The results provided limited support for Blumer's group position model. Compensatory and preferential treatment policies had different underlying predictors: Violated entitlement featured in the models of compensatory policy attitudes, but not preferential treatment policy attitudes, where threat was the strongest predictor. In addition to threat and violated entitlement, policy attitudes among the black sample were related to ingroup identification but those of the white sample were related to prejudice. The effects of these variables were in the opposite directions for the two samples: Policy support was associated with strong ingroup identification and high levels of threat among the black sample (i.e. prospective beneficiaries of the transformation policies), but with low levels of prejudice and threat among the white sample. We conclude by considering the implications that these findings have for social change programs. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Exploring the self-directed anger of the stigmatized: The interplay between perceived legitimacy and social identification
AN  - 1018356358; 201212734
AB  - Does social identification protect or harm targets of discrimination? Two studies (N = 52, N = 94) tested the prediction that perceived legitimacy moderates the impact of social identification on negative responses to discrimination. Results confirm that when discrimination is perceived as illegitimate, identification is negatively related to self-directed anger (buffering effect) because identification provides a feeling of in-group support. However, when discrimination is perceived as legitimate, identification is positively related to self-directed anger (exacerbating effect) because the internalized social identity is perceived as legitimate target for the negative treatment. Legitimacy is measured and manipulated among different low-status groups. The legitimization and internalization of discrimination driven by self-directed anger are discussed.

T1  - Strangers on the Shore? Racialized Representation, Identity and In/visibilities of Whiteness at the English Seaside
AN  - 1010630393; 201210485
AB  - This article presents an alternative reading of the English seaside -- one that centralizes race, specifically the effects of whiteness and racialized notions of belonging and exclusion. It addresses three main issues. First, it provides a theoretical discussion of the racialized production of social space and place, and outlines the implications for minority ethnic groups at the seaside. Second, it offers an examination of the manner in which discourses of whiteness and (neo-)colonial fantasy are reproduced through amusements and other elements of seaside popular culture. Third, it demonstrates the centrality of the seaside to analysing dominant, racialized interpretations of English national identity and demotic responses to contemporary immigration. The article argues that the seaside is an enlightening site for understanding contemporary constructions, manifestations and repercussions of whiteness, and thus provides an important insight into the cultural and spatial politics of race in 21st-century Britain.

T1  - Does Gender Matter? Men and Women on Controversial Social Issues
AN  - 835113505; 201102197
AB  - In this article we explore gender differences in opinion regarding controversial social issues. The issues we selected are: attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, Muslims, Affirmative Action, abortion, and gays and lesbians. This selection is based on the importance of these issues in public debate and electoral politics. A number of these issues, mainly those related to opinions toward religious and racial groups, reflect the development of the American society and draw lines of possible disagreements and social cleavages. Our purpose is to draw attention to an important factor in determining public opinion toward these issues. We aim to explore issues where gender makes a clear difference, where it does not only hold an important role as other factors such as race and political affiliation, and where considerations of gender need to be combined with other personal attributes in order to understand their real impact. These highlights are intended to shed light on the role of gender in social issues as well as understanding these issues from a perspective that includes gender as a dimension in opinion making.

AN  - 818801649; 201072687
AB  - This study investigates the discursive peregrinations of the 'Han' category in the writings of the Chinese revolutionary, theoretician and activist Qu Qiubai. In the papers he wrote at the beginning of the 1930s dealing with the questions of language and writing, the author made singular use of the concept 'Han' to talk about the language/writing of the 'Han' (Hanzi, Hanyu) as a racial or ethnic group (Hanzu). Qu elaborated a discourse which articulated and mobilized, sometimes in a contradictory manner, the 'Han' category both as a 'race' and as a social class. Going beyond the race/class dialectic, I will try to show that these texts question the territorial, cultural and ethnic boundaries of 'China' and its homogeneity. Following this argument, this paper demonstrates how Qu's attempt to define 'Chinese language(s)' helps us to elucidate the complex articulation between China as a discursive and spatial category, the 'Han' category, and the other nationalities in the Chinese space. By questioning the homogeneity of the linguistic identity of China, using the word zhongguohua, Qu Qiubai unveiled an unstable and fragile imaginary relative to China and its so-called majority ethnic group, the Han.

T1  - Ethnic and Transnational Dimensions of Recent Protestant Conversion among the Hmong in Northern Vietnam
AN  - 764425915; 201064785
AB  - The author argues that ethnic and transnational dimensions are crucial to an understanding of the conversion of the Hmong to Protestantism in Northern Vietnam. Although a number of scholars have proposed that the study of religion be incorporated into the study of transnationalism, the "transnationalization" of religion is still rather understudied, and there have been few scholarly efforts to analyze the transnational aspects of the conversions to world religions of marginalized ethnic minority groups in countries with high levels of emigration. The author examines the transnationalization of religion via the case of the Hmong conversion to show that the impact of missionization is twofold, as not only does the habitus of the Hmong in Vietnam change through massive conversion but so also does the subjectivity of the Hmong missionaries. She proposes to conceptualize the evangelical mission of the Hmong diasporas in Vietnam in particular and in Asia in general as a form of "remittance of faith and modernity".

T1  - STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF RACE AND ETHNIC RELATIONS POST OBAMA'S ELECTION: A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
AN  - 762232135
AB  - Seventy-three students, who attend a predominantly white, Northeastern college, participated in this 2009-2010 pilot study that drew from Bonilla-Silva's previous research. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we examined students' exposure to diversity and their views on affirmative action, interracial marriage, intergroup contact, minorities' cultural values and life chances, racial discrimination, and their perceptions of race issues in the U.S. since Obama's election. Although some students employed Bonilla-Silva's four frames of color-blind racism, students also acknowledged structural factors of racism and exhibited a deeper understanding of race and ethnic relations than was previously suggested in Bonilla-Silva's work. We explore varying reasons for this as well as analyze students' identification with the value of post-racialism as symbolized by Obama's presidency. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceived Entitativity and the Black-Sheep Effect: When Will We Denigrate Negative Ingroup Members?
AN  - 743045285; 201026391
AB  - Although ingroup favoritism is a robust effect, there are notable exceptions. For example, the outgroup extremity effect indicates outgroup derogation, whereas the black-sheep effect indicates ingroup derogation. We propose that perceived entitativity, the degree to which a group is viewed as a unified social entity, may help explain ingroup derogation. Negative ingroup members from high perceived entitativity groups may pose a meaningful threat to the perceiver's social identity that can be alleviated by denigrating the target (i.e., the black-sheep effect). Participants evaluated high or low quality essays attributed to ingroup & outgroup members. Participants did not differentiate based on ingroup/outgroup membership for low perceived entitativity groups. However, when rating high perceived entitativity groups, ingroup extremity emerged. These results confirm & provide explanations for ingroup denigration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity in the person, diversity in the group: Challenges of identity complexity for social perception and social interaction
AN  - 60396957; 201017393
AB  - Social psychological research is increasingly coming to grips with the complexity of social identity within the individual, both from the perspective of perceivers trying to form impressions and make judgments about multiply categorizable targets, as well as from the perspective of actors using their different self-aspects as a framework for guiding their interactions with the social world. I review several contributions to the effort to better understand these issues and then explore some of their possible implications for understanding the nature and consequences of diversity within the group.
