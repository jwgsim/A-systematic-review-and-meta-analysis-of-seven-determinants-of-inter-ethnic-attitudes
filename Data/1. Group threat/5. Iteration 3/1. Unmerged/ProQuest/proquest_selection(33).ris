T1  - The effect of perceived threat on human rights: A meta-analysis: GPIR
AN  - 2621963473
AB  - Individuals express support for civil liberties and human rights, but when threatened tend to restrict rights for both others and themselves. However, the question of whether or not rights are restricted to punish others or protect ourselves remains unclear. This meta-analysis integrates the findings of the effect of perceived threats on support for restrictions of civil liberties from 1997 to 2019. It includes 163 effect-size estimates from 46 different articles involving 91,716 participants. The presence of threat increased support for restrictions against outgroup members significantly more than ingroup members, providing a possible punitive explanation for support for restrictions of civil liberties. These findings contribute to the debate on rights and their relationship with deservingness, suggesting that we delineate those who deserve human rights and those who do not.

T1  - Prejudice and pandemic in the promised land: how white Christian nationalism shapes Americans’ racist and xenophobic views of COVID-19
AN  - 2492800004
AB  - During the COVID-19 crisis in March/April of 2020, far-right American political leaders and pundits proffered xenophobic explanations for the pandemic while ignoring that poorer, Black Americans and prison populations were being disproportionately infected. We propose such xenophobic and racist evaluations of COVID-19 drew from and appealed to a pervasive and politically strategic ethnoreligious ideology—white Christian nationalism. Panel data fielded before and during the COVID-19 crisis show that Christian nationalism was invariably the strongest predictor that Americans felt it was not racist to call COVID-19 “the Chinese virus”, blamed minorities for their own disproportionate infection rate, favoured immigration restrictions to solve the pandemic, and minimized or justified the infections of prison inmates. Racial identity also moderated Christian nationalism’s effect such that it was typically a more powerful influence among whites compared to Blacks. Findings affirm that racist and xenophobic views promulgated during the COVID-19 crisis were undergirded by white Christian nationalism.

T1  - Colorism and Physical Health: Evidence from a National Survey
AN  - 2499344044
AB  - This study uses nationally representative data to extend a steadily growing body of research on the health consequences of skin color by comparatively examining the consequences of perceived ingroup and outgroup skin color discrimination (perceived colorism) for physical health among African Americans. Using a comprehensive set of measures of physical health, I find that perceived ingroup colorism is significantly associated with worse physical health outcomes among African Americans. Notably, the magnitude of ingroup colorism’s associations with most of these outcomes rivals or even exceeds that of major lifetime discrimination, everyday discrimination, and perceived outgroup colorism. These findings compellingly suggest the inclusion of perceived colorism measures in future survey data collection efforts.

T1  - Celebrity Advocacy and Women’s Rights in Nigeria
AN  - 2448821640
AB  - To bring development closer to the reality of “ordinary” people, popular personalities, working on behalf of themselves, family, or organizations (profit and non-profit) in Africa have consistently given visibility to social problems to influence public opinion for positive transformation. The involvement of celebrities in development-centered issues has evoked debates from scholars in the global north who thought that their act is an extension of neoliberalism that sought to transform complex social realities into a spectacle of performance and entertainment for public amusement. While scholars in Europe and North America have engaged the intersections of celebrity advocacy and development discourse, little attention has been given to this phenomenon by their counterparts in Africa. Drawing from primary sources (including films, video, audio, newspaper articles, autobiography) as well as secondary data in the fields of sociology, women’s and gender studies, media, and popular culture, this paper examines the interrelatedness of celebrity advocacy and social reforms in Nigeria. It shows that while celebrity advocacy promotes awareness and consciousness about women’s rights, it often does not lead to protection (enforcement and change) in the socio-economic and political status of women.

T1  - Support for democracy and liberal sexual mores among Muslims in Western Europe
AN  - 2406161809
AB  - There is an on-going debate whether a ‘clash of civilizations’ exists between Islam and the West, in particular in relation to support for democracy and endorsement of liberal sexual mores. This study aims to explain Muslim minorities’ support for democracy and their attitude towards these mores by making a comparison with majority members and by considering the level of religiosity and sense of national belonging. Using data from four European countries (Belgium, Germany, U.K., Switzerland), we found that Muslims compared to majority members were less supportive of democracy and of liberal sexual mores. Furthermore, these differences could be explained by Muslims’ higher level of religiosity and weaker national belonging (for liberal sexual mores). These findings demonstrate that the so-called ‘clash’ is more prominent in the case of liberal sexual mores than democracy and that not only religiosity but also the development of a sense of national belonging is important.

T1  - Positive and negative intergroup contact and shared reality: Contact effects among host society and refugees
AN  - 2341204905
AB  - Two cross‐sectional studies examined the relationship between positive and negative intergroup contact and shared reality from a majority and a minority group perspective and indirect effects via two types of intergroup threat (threat to identity for the majority, discrimination fear for the minority) and differential closeness. Research was conducted in the context of German–Syrian relations to contrast contact effects on shared reality among German host society members and Syrian refugees. Study 1 revealed unique and asymmetrical effects of valenced contact on shared reality and indirect effects via threat to identity and differential closeness (N = 226). In Study 2, positive contact among Syrian refugees (N = 121) increased shared reality via differential closeness. Negative contact showed no relation to shared reality, but mediation analyses indicated an indirect effect via discrimination fear. Differences between majority and minority contact effects on shared reality are discussed along with the studies’ limitations and implications.

T1  - The nation under threat: secularist, racial and populist nativism in the Netherlands
AN  - 2316452624
AB  - Right-wing discourses and issues of belonging and collective identity in Europe's political and public spheres are often analysed in terms of Islamophobia, racism and populism. While acknowledging the value of these concepts, Kesic and Duyvendak argue that these discourses can be better understood through the logic of nativism. Their article opens with a conceptual clarification of nativism, which they define as an intense opposition to an internal minority that is seen as a threat to the nation due to its 'foreignness'. This is followed by the analysis of nativism's three subtypes: secularist nativism, problematizing particularly Islam and Muslims; racial nativism, problematizing black minorities; and populist nativism, problematizing 'native' elites. The authors show that the logic of nativism offers the advantages of both analytical precision and scope. The article focuses on the Dutch case as a specific illustration of a broader European trend.

T1  - Homosexuality as <i>Haram</i>: Relations among Gender, Contact, Religiosity, and Sexual Prejudice in Muslim Individuals
AN  - 2135410243
AB  - Most research on sexual prejudice has focused on Western and Christian samples. Using the framework of social identity theory, we investigated the relations among gender, contact, religiosity, and sexual prejudice in a sample of 166 heterosexual Muslim individuals (70.7% from Saudi Arabia) residing in the United States. Consistent with prior research, men reported higher levels of prejudice than women did, especially toward gay men. Higher levels of religiosity predicted higher levels of sexual prejudice for both men and women, but the association was stronger for women. Additionally, more frequent and positive contact with friends and/or family members who were lesbian or gay predicted less sexual prejudice. However, contact was more strongly associated with less sexual prejudice in women than in men. Exploratory analyses revealed that more time spent in the United Sates predicted lower levels of sexual prejudice, and participants from Saudi Arabia reported more sexual prejudice than Muslims from other countries. The current research contributes to the understanding of factors that influence sexual prejudice within Islam and sheds light on the heterogeneity of attitudes within this group of individuals. Furthermore, our findings may help inform efforts to decrease sexual prejudice and increase awareness, advocacy, and future research within Islamic cultures.

T1  - Political inequality in America: Who loses on spending policy? When is policy less biased?
AN  - 2571083365
AB  - Rapid growth in America’s economic inequality and endemic disadvantages among racial minorities have deepened fears about unequal political influence. From separate studies, it appears that the government responds more to the wealthy and to whites. But critical questions remain unanswered. What are relative contributions of race and class to government responsiveness? Why do these inequalities exist in the first place? And under what contexts are disparities in responsiveness reduced? To answer these questions, we assess the congruence between individual-level policy preferences and policy outcomes using the General Social Survey. We match individual spending preferences in 11 policy areas with actual federal spending to see whose preferences are realized. We find that race, more regularly than class, shapes government responsiveness. We also find that Democratic Party control eliminates most of the racial bias in responsiveness. Economic growth also narrows racial inequalities.

T1  - Political rhetoric and attitudes toward nationhood: A time-comparative and cross-national analysis of 39 countries
AN  - 2154944527
AB  - Research on the relationship between nationhood and individual attitudes prominently focuses on whether – and how – the distinction between ethnic and civic conceptions may be drawn in mass public opinion. We depart from this literature to explain the effects of party rhetoric on shaping more restrictive conceptions of nationhood, which previous research refers to as “ethnic,” “objective,” or “ascriptive” views on nationhood. We do so in three parts: we examine whether political rhetoric, in terms of party manifestos, and individual-level conceptions of nationhood are linked; whether the relationship depends on the ideological alignment between political parties and respondents; and whether political rhetoric and individual predisposition act in combination. We analyze three waves of survey data from the International Social Survey Program’s National Identity module from 1995, 2003 and 2013, covering 58,498 respondents from 39 countries. We find that political rhetoric influences respondents’ conceptions of nationhood. This effect, however, is not as straightforward as initially expected. While the overall political climate does not have a direct effect at the societal level, it does affect the way in which a specific party’s political messages influence the attitudes of their individual recipients. Once the political climate is more ethnocentric, conceptions of nationhood tend to be more restrictive across the board, even among respondents aligned with parties that do not emphasize ethnic conceptions.

T1  - Toward a Social Psychological Understanding of Migration and Assimilation
AN  - 2024709922
AB  - The experience of migrating and attempting to integrate into a host society is personally and interactionally daunting. This article suggests ways social psychological perspectives may deepen our understanding of the interactional processes that shape experiences of migration and assimilation. We argue that existing migration literature highlights assimilation outcomes while undertheorizing the social psychological processes that constitute assimilation. In this article, we begin by showing how social psychological perspectives on migration relate to traditional sociological studies of assimilation by reviewing research on stereotyping and prejudice. Next, we review studies utilizing social identity theory and symbolic interactionism to explore how immigrants cast off stigma and give positive meaning to themselves. We conclude by suggesting how incorporating social psychological perspectives into research on migration and assimilation gives us important insights into the dynamic, interactive social processes that give meaning to those experiences.

T1  - The Anger Games: Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Election, and Why?
AN  - 2010612036
AB  - Recently released data from the 2016 American National Election Study allow us to offer a multifaceted profile of white voters who voted for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We find that Trump’s supporters voted for him mainly because they share his prejudices, not because they’re financially stressed. It’s true, as exit polls showed, that voters without four-year college degrees were likelier than average to support Trump. But millions of these voters—who are often stereotyped as “the white working class”—opposed Trump because they oppose his prejudices. These prejudices, meanwhile, have a definite structure, which we argue should be called authoritarian: negatively, they target minorities and women; and positively, they favor domineering and intolerant leaders who are uninhibited about their biases. Multivariate logistic regression shows that, once we take these biases into account, demographic factors (age, education, etc.) lose their explanatory power. The electorate, in short, is deeply divided. Nearly 75% of Trump supporters count themselves among his enthusiastic supporters, and even “mild” Trump voters are much closer in their attitudes to Trump’s enthusiasts than they are to non-Trump voters. Polarization is profound, and may be growing.

T1  - Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility
AN  - 1999028580
AB  - Collectively blaming groups for the actions of individuals can license vicarious retribution. Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an “interventions tournament” to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The “winning” intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslims—but not other groups (White Americans, Christians)—for individual group members’ actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.

T1  - What Explains the Differential Treatment of Renters Based on Ethnicity? New Evidence From Sydney
AN  - 1987415031
AB  - This article conducts the first contextual analysis of ethnic-based discrimination in an Australian rental housing market: metropolitan Sydney. Logistic regression is employed to investigate how the likelihood of five behaviors by rental agents that may favor Anglo home seekers varies according to characteristics of the agent, home seeker, dwelling, and neighborhood. We find that several forms of discrimination favoring Anglos are consistently more likely in neighborhoods characterized by lower crime rates and shares of renter households, regardless of the ethnicity of the agent. Other patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general in the Sydney rental market, agents regardless of ethnicity are motivated to discriminate by statistical discrimination. Our result that profit, not prejudice, drives discrimination implies that it will prove resilient to unfettered housing market forces and changes in societal ethnic tolerance, but instead, must be addressed through enhanced civil rights enforcement strategies.

T1  - Barriers to Remarriage Among Older People: Viewpoints of Widows and Widowers
AN  - 1977678138
AB  - We conducted this research based on a qualitative approach to describe the opinions of older widows and widowers on remarriage obstacles. Based on purposive sampling and inclusion criteria, we chose 48 participants on maximum diversity of sex, age, education, employment, and socioeconomic status. Two thirds of the participants were female, 40% had spent more than 10 years widowed, and 65% were living with their children. We collected data individually through semistructured, face-to-face interviews. Based on conventional content analyses, 2 independent researchers implemented data analysis manually. Barriers to remarriage were finally categorized into 4 main themes: personal, normative, interactive, and financial factors. Results of this study showed that older people are more concerned about public opinions and social norms surrounding remarriage. As long as these thoughts and norms are not changed, the concept of remarriage among widows and widowers remains a vital taboo and concern.

T1  - Does ethnic identification promote integration into the larger society? A study of youth in Oslo
AN  - 1900464783
AB  - This paper uses survey data from Oslo to examine whether strong ethnic identification helps or hinders the integration of adolescents from immigrant families into the larger Norwegian society. Dependent variables are openness to other ethnic groups than one's own, educational achievement, and positive self-concept. The findings are generally positive for the integration of adolescents with immigrant parents in Oslo. In particular, ethnic identification is positively associated with socio-cultural openness to ethnic others, and with having a positive self-concept. However, ethnic identification does not appear to facilitate educational achievement. Nor does it generally appear to do so when it is combined with strong openness to ethnic others.

T1  - Role of diasporas in homeland conflicts, conflict resolution, and post-war reconstruction: the case of Tamil diaspora and Sri Lanka
AN  - 1922922098
AB  - The case of Sri Lanka and the Tamil diaspora can be cited as a classic case of participation by a diaspora in the homeland conflict and to some extent also in conflict resolution. Influenced by lived experiences of discrimination and suffering in an ethnocentric homeland and a range of racial prejudices and economic deprivation, in the host lands, the diaspora Tamils developed a strong sense of Tamil identity and ethno-nationalism which the LTTE could successfully harvest on. However, with the devastating civil war coming to an end, and a new government in power, numerous opportunities have opened up for diaspora participation in the development and reconstruction of the war-torn regions. All that is required is a pragmatic and reconciliatory approach by both sides - by the diaspora as well as by the Sri Lankan state.

T1  - Under the shadow of genocide: Rwandans, ethnicity and refugee status
AN  - 1871585291
AB  - This article discusses ethnicity and refugee status among Rwandan refugees self-settled in Nairobi, Kenya. It addresses conflation of Hutu fugitives who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and refugees, and critiques perception of Hutu and Tutsi as mutually exclusive ethnicities with no points of intersection. Framed within the social constructivist approach to identity, the article problematizes ethnic essentialism and wholesale criminalization and stigmatization of Rwandan refugees and, in particular, Hutu ethnicity in ways that silence individual viewpoints emanating from personal experience. Conversely, the article highlights how Rwandan refugees deflect collective guilt and legitimize their refugee status under the shadow of the genocide which was committed by extremist Hutu on Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The refugees' reaction to association with the genocide confounds theoretically irreconcilable extremes through self-representations centred on experiences that muddle the simplistic perpetrator - victim and guilty - innocent binary. The refugees' narratives portray victimhood in Rwanda as complex, cyclical and heterogeneous.

T1  - Andalusia at the crossroads of Europeanness: immigration as a performance of coloniality
AN  - 1862143851
AB  - The semantics of cultural diversity, based on the political discourses of immigration as they appear in integration and anti-racist policies in Andalusia, underline the sense of Otherness of immigrant groups. In this article, Castaño, Martínez and Periáñez focus on the most relevant texts in the Planes Integrales para la Inmigración en Andalucía (Comprehensive Plans for Immigration in Andalusia). To date, these texts have formed the most significant discursive framework for representations of the third sector, trade unions and public agencies involved in the management of diversity. The key ideas in the plans revolve around transnational political references in the context of the European Union (EU). They impose a sense of Europeanness on Andalusia that is in opposition to its historical heritage, endogenous diversity and cultural specificity, and thus steer the imaginary of Andalusia's identity towards a Eurocentric idea that enhances the region's peripheral position. Immigration is regarded in the hegemonic media discourse and the social imaginary as a risk and a social problem. Integration policies, despite being couched in anti-racist rhetoric, are specifically targeted at immigrants, further enhancing the idea of Otherness. The notion of interculturality is the leitmotiv of these policies. In practical terms, however, action is limited to empty measures in the field of education. These policies, in sum, neutralize, rather than reinforce, the sense of equality on which interculturality is based. The examination of the intertextuality of Andalusian, Spanish and European discourses reveals the conformity of the discourse of Andalusia's coloniality within the framework of the EU.

T1  - When school meets the Other: intercultural policies in the Basque inclusive school
AN  - 1862143788
AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskara-the Basque language-as a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. 'Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any 'racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through 'interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called 'immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as 'problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

T1  - Debating the Racial Turn in U.S. Ethnic and Immigration History
AN  - 1864054696
AB  - Pegler-Gordon highlights the turning process with articles by Donna Gabaccia, Jon Gjerde, and Erika Lee. Although the contributors focused on varied aspects of immigration history, the strongest divisions about the state of the field were expressed by George Sanchez and Rudolph Vecoli. These divisions focused primarily on the racial turn. In his article "Race, Nation, and Culture in Recent Immigration Studies," Sanchez argued that immigration history was constructed around a normative model of European immigration, and that immigration historians had unsuccessfully attempted to expand this model to include new, racialized groups of immigrants such as Asians and Latinos.

T1  - Human Rights: What the United States Might Learn from the Rest of the World and, Yes, from American Sociology
AN  - 1844786825
AB  - The U.S. Constitution includes civil and political rights--as individual rights--but does not include what is internationally understood to be "human rights," namely rights we enjoy as equals, including economic, social, and cultural rights, and protections for vulnerable persons, such as children, minorities, mothers, and refugees. The United States has not ratified any international (United Nations) or regional (Organization of American States) human rights treaty, is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court, and is no longer a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. It might be concluded that Americans do not know what human rights are. It is more complicated than that. While opinion polls show that Americans often endorse individual rights--e. g., the rights of women--they do not frame them as being interdependent or being within the purview of government. Can we conclude that human rights have no place in the United States? Not at all. This article concludes by showing that many U.S. institutions of higher learning have programs in human rights and that some academic associations, including the American Sociological Association, recognize human rights.

T1  - Out of context: the absence of geographic variation in US immigrants' perceptions of discrimination
AN  - 2571073991
AB  - Immigrants' perceptions of discrimination (PD) correlate strongly with various political outcomes, including group consciousness and partisan identity. Here, we examine the hypothesis that immigrants' PD vary across US localities, as threatened responses by native-born residents may increase perceived discrimination among neighboring immigrants. We also consider the alternative hypothesis that barriers to the expression and detection of discrimination decouple native-born attitudes from immigrants' perceptions about their treatment. We test these claims by analyzing three national surveys of almost 11,000 first-generation Latino, Asian, and Muslim immigrants. The results indicate that immigrants' PD hardly vary across localities. While anti-immigrant attitudes are known to be geographically clustered, immigrants' PD prove not to be. This mismatch helps us narrow the potential causes of perceived discrimination, and it suggests the value of further research into perceived discrimination's consequences for immigrants' social and political incorporation.

T1  - Violence against migrants in Greece: beyond the Golden Dawn
AN  - 1807590862
AB  - Violence perpetrated against migrants by Golden Dawn was rarely investigated or prosecuted by Greek authorities and was discursively constructed as exceptional, contrary to the norms of Greek democracy and committed by marginalized individuals and groups. The article argues that state responses have been shaped by racialized discourses and policies on migration and racism. Anti-migrant violence has been legitimated through three interlinked discursive strategies: a narrative of 'isolated events'; the denial of its racialized nature; and the rationalization of both state and non-state anti-migrant violence as a regrettable yet understandable defensive reaction to the threats posed by migration.

T1  - Color-conscious Anti-racism: Bias and Opportunity in the Violent Victimization of Central American Migrants in Long Island, NY
AN  - 1797683189
AB  - In 2008, Ecuadorean migrant Marcelo Lucero was murdered in Patchogue, New York, by seven White, Black, and Hispanic teenagers who described what they had done as "Mexican hopping." A widespread belief emerged, including in scholarly publications, that the killing reflected pervasive racism directed at Latin American migrants, particularly vulnerable undocumented ones. The killing and the public discourses that emerged from it led community organizations to sponsor events and programs to teach ethno-racial tolerance and the local government to prescribe sensitivity training for police and other public officials. However, the assumptions that drove such policies remain untested by research. This article seeks to address this lacuna through a respondent driven sampling survey of 146 Central American migrants who reported victimization during the previous twelve months in neighboring Nassau County in 2008. Findings suggest that anti-racist correctives meant to address the Lucero killing did not meet the needs or concerns of the majority of violently victimized migrants whose primary vulnerability appears to be based on legal status and their status as part of the roughly 20 percent of the United States that is un- or under-banked, more than, or in addition to, their racial or ethnic identity.

T1  - More than a paycheck: nannies, work, and identity
AN  - 1792351196
AB  - Nannies are paid childcare providers employed in private households. In Northeastern cities, they vary by many personal characteristics, including race, ethnicity, immigrant status, and education. This study compares the identity work of two groups of nannies: one composed of immigrant women of color and the other composed mainly of US-born white women. Building upon existing research on the difference between precarious work and precarious working conditions in domestic work, this study finds that immigrant women of color respond to disrespect and discrimination by defending the respectability of their work and their personal dignity. In contrast, US-born and white women respond to the stigma of doing socially devalued work by distancing themselves from their work. The implications of workers' agency and identity on organizing and social movements are considered.

T1  - On the Social Foundations for Crimmigration: Latino Threat and Support for Expanded Police Powers
AN  - 1771276731
AB  - Objectives
Because of the merging of immigration control and criminal justice, or "crimmigration," state and local police increasingly drive interior immigration enforcement through the routine policing of crime. At the same time, growing evidence indicates that immigration is an ethnicity-coded issue that allows for the veiled expression of broader anti-Latino sentiments. Yet little research has examined whether public perceptions of either immigrants or Latinos influence support for police policies and practices that, in the context of crimmigration, may significantly shape immigration enforcement and, more broadly, may contribute to the subordination of Latinos. The current study addresses this research question.
Methods
The study draws on data from a recent nationally representative telephone survey and employs multivariate regression methods to evaluate whether perceptions of Latino economic and political threat are associated with support for granting police greater latitude in stopping, searching, and using force against suspects.
Results
This study provides the first evidence that, at least among Whites, perceived Latino threat is positively associated with support for expanding police investigative powers, especially the power to stop suspects based only on the way they look.
Conclusions
The results suggest that by increasing public support for aggressive policing, or, at minimum, by reducing opposition to discriminatory social controls such as police profiling, Latino threat perceptions may increase the political attractiveness and viability of crimmigration as a "solution" to the "Latino problem."

T1  - UNDERSTANDING MOTIVATIONAL CAREER CHOICES OF AFRICAN AMERICAN CRIMINAL JUSTICE STUDENTS
AN  - 1899015267
AB  - Although research on the negative relationship between African Americans and the criminal justice system has been well documented over the past two decades, researchers have inadequately addressed why African Americans choose a career in the criminal justice field despite this negativity. This phenomenological study was designed to explore the motivations guiding career choice of African American college students enrolled in 2-year and 4-year criminal justice programs. Five males and one female, all within one year of graduating from their program and entering the field, participated. In one-on-one interviews the students responded to a series of 12 semistructured, open-ended questions encompassing their lived experiences with racism and discrimination, identifying the influences for career choice, personal perspectives of the criminal justice system, and expectant career goals. Data analysis revealed four themes: living with racism, career choice influences, racism in criminal justice, and cultural education leads to change based on student responses, specifically with each of the study ' s participants unexpectedly reporting to having negative experiences with the criminal justice system as their primary career choice motivation. Critical race and symbolic interactionism theories provided a framework in understanding how these six students ' perceptions of their ethnic identities and lived experiences with racism and discrimination impacted their career choices. Future extensive, qualitative research on the criminal justice career choice made by African American college students will provide a clearer understanding for educators and administrators. This may also provide the foundation for meaningful changes being made in the criminal justice system with regards to cultural sensitivity.

T1  - Traveling Words: A Reflection on "Rotundamente negra" and Afro-Descendant Women's Cultural Politics: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1880680328
AB  - This paper is both a personal reflection and critical analysis of the circulation of the poem "Rotundamente negra" by Afro-Costa Rican poet and cultural activist Shirley Campbell among Afro-descendant women in Latin America. As I heard various recitations and interpretations of the poem at several meetings of Afro-descendant social movements across the Americas, I was also bearing witness to the process by which creative cultural expressions become politicized and popularized by their audiences, especially Afro-descendant women, to reflect a collective desire, goal, and identity. When the poem was first published in 1994, its circulation was limited among literary circles in Costa Rica and the local Afro-Costa Rican women's movement. Now a quick search on Google reveals hundreds of "hits" on social media sites and electronic magazines, revealing not only the impact of technology, but also of the physical transnational flows of Afro-descendant women and their ideas at conferences, meeting one another, and finding common ground through political activism and poetry. Most significant is the meaning women attach to the poem and the places where it is interpreted, recited, or posted. The circulation and the appeal of the poem signals that Black women in various parts of the Americas are collectively using it not only as a tool of self-expression, but also as a point of departure for consciousness-raising, identity formation, and collective action. In a region where Black women live doubly-invisible lives amongst the most marginalized of the hemisphere, the poem is both a self-affirmation and a battle cry. The poem relates to the "everyday" of Black women's lives and reveals itself to be a seemingly "innocent" but influential tool of empowerment. Black women recognize themselves in the verses and they "recognize the array of forces controlling their lives" (Bobo igg5, 6). "Rotundamente negra" politicizes as it circulates through the Americas with its message of racial identification and pride that defies the homogenizing tendencies of mestizaje and blanqueamiento. The poem has become an affirming instrument to support, but also a meaningful platform for Black women's organizations, activists, and individuals.

T1  - Black Churches and Mental Health Professionals: Can This Collaboration Work?
AN  - 1752271679
AB  - African Americans reportedly have a greater severity of untreated mental health disorders than any other known racial group. History purports that African Americans are more likely to rely on the elders of their churches and their own spiritual beliefs, rather than seek support from mental health professionals. Due to past and present experiences with institutionalized racism in America, Black church leadership and their members have been apprehensive to collaborate with mental health agencies. This article explores how clergy of Black churches and leaders in mental health agencies may collaborate to provide culturally sensitive services for African Americans.

T1  - Support for Far Right Ideology and Anti-Migrant Attitudes among Youth in Europe: A Comparative Analysis
AN  - 1993534260
AB  - The last decade has seen a notable increase in support for far right parties and an alarming rise of right-wing extremism across Europe. Drawing on a new comparative youth survey in 14 European countries, this article provides deeper insight into young people's support for nationalist and far right ideology: negative attitudes towards minorities, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism and exclusionism in relation to migrants. We first map the support for far right ideology among youth in Europe, and then use multilevel regression analysis (16,935 individuals nested in 30 locations) to investigate which individual or contextual factors are associated with a higher propensity among young people towards getting involved in far right movements.

T1  - Four Waves of Muslim-Phobia in Sri Lanka: c.1880-2009
AN  - 1752271689
AB  - The end of the civil war in Sri Lanka (1983-2009) has disappointingly failed to deliver any peace dividend. Instead, an era of triumphalism with a mood of schadenfreude entered the ruling quarters bringing in even more humiliation and uncertainties to ethnic minorities. The Muslim community has become the latest victim of this triumphalism. The ultra-nationalist Bodhu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force), a Buddhist organization led by an obstreperous firebrand monk Galagodaththe Gnanasara is on a nationwide rampage spreading anti-Muslim venom to cause material and psychological harm to the Muslim community. In the ultimate analysis this anti-Muslim rage on top of an anti-Tamil Buddhist nationalism is heading towards jeopardizing the pluralist character of Sri Lanka's democracy. Yet, the current anti-Muslim episode is only the latest of its kind. There had been three previous waves of such trend, the first during the British colonial regime, which culminated in the 1915 racial riots, the second during the so called socialist era of Prime Minister Srimavo Bandaranaike, climaxing in the 1976 Puttalam riots, and the third after the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom. In the current or the fourth wave, the Alutgama riots of 2014 was yet the most destructive. In all four waves Muslims have been at the receiving end of the onslaught. Will they continue to remain so? What are their options? [web URL: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13602004.2015.1112116]

T1  - Hidden in Plain Sight: Locating, Validating, and Advocating the Stigma Experiences of Women of Color
AN  - 1719468012
AB  - In this commentary, we reflect and expand on Remedios and Snyder's (2015) target paper "How Women of Color Detect and Respond to Multiple Forms of Prejudice." We, initially, address the perceived lack of available women of color participants for human behavior studies conducted in the United States. We offer remedies to this expectation of deficits in order for researchers to retool their recruitment plans for traditional undergraduate subjects. Specifically, we highlight the changing demographic profiles of U.S. undergraduate students and we draw attention to potentially overlooked campus-based sources of women of color participants. Next, we discuss validated measures for researchers interested in assessing individuals with multiply-stigmatized group identities. The individual difference measures (double consciousness and chronic ostracism experiences) as well as an explicit evaluation (Strong Black Woman schema) may inform pending research examining group processes, health-related indicators, and predicted behaviors. Moreover, we identify critical areas of psychological research that can inform administrators of public policies and enlighten stakeholders for institutional transformations. In particular, we focus on factors that affect representation and retention of women in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields in the Unites States. In sum, these suggestions have extensive implications for enhancing research on the stigma experiences and responses to prejudice for women of color, by providing U.S. researchers with practical solutions for recruiting women of color and measuring their experiences.

T1  - Beyond Prejudice? Young Whites' Racial Attitudes in Post-Civil Rights America, 1976 to 2000: PROD
AN  - 1710020623
AB  - A key finding from previous research on trends in Whites' racial attitudes is that much of the decline in the expression of racial prejudice over the past seven decades can be attributed to the replacement of older, less tolerant White cohorts by younger, more tolerant cohorts of Whites in the U.S. population (i.e., cohort replacement). An implicit assumption of much of this work is that cohort replacement will continue to produce unidirectional liberalizing trends in Whites' racial attitudes because of the more tolerant attitudes of each younger cohort. In this article, we reexamine the cohort replacement hypothesis focusing on young Whites' racial attitudes and whether change is in substance or form. We develop a theoretical argument about the shifting nature of young Whites' racial attitudes and understandings in the post-civil rights era by building on Forman's concept of racial apathy and the expanding literature on color-blind racism, which posits that during the post-civil rights era, subtle forms of racial prejudice have become more prevalent than overt forms. We empirically test this argument by investigating trends in, and determinants of, young Whites' racial attitudes from 1976 to 2000, using nationally representative samples of White high school seniors. Although we find a liberalizing trend for some racial attitudes, we do not find a similar pattern for contemporary forms of prejudice, particularly racial apathy. In addition, we find that the social determinants of young Whites' social distance attitudes (traditional prejudice) and expressions of racial apathy (contemporary prejudice) have been remarkably consistent over time. Collectively, these results indicate the need for greater attention to the expression of subtle forms of prejudice among young Whites generally, and to the potentially destructive force of rising levels of racial apathy specifically.

T1  - Minority Representation and Political Efficacy in Public Meetings
AN  - 1708518461; 201528701
AB  - Objective: The objective of this article is to address a chief criticism of public meetings in democratic society, a lack of minority representation. Further, it explores the issue of political efficacy and the extent to which it may differ between minority and nonminority citizens. Methods: These issues are analyzed through logistic and multiple regression models applied to the results of a random-sample telephone survey administered across the United States (N = 601). Results: Results indicate that members of one minority group, African Americans, are more likely to attend public meetings than whites. Further, no statistically significant differences between whites and Hispanics or other-race individuals were found. African Americans also reported higher levels of political efficacy than whites, while no statistically significant difference was found between whites and Hispanics or other-race individuals for this measure. Conclusion: Thus, public meetings are not necessarily fraught with a lack of minority representation, nor do minorities necessarily suffer from lower levels of political efficacy than whites. Findings indicate a potential for minority representation in public meetings. Thus, rather than dismissing public meetings as legally required rituals, there is reason to improve the methods used to mobilize attendance and facilitate two-way communication between citizens and government.

T1  - Understanding the Socioeconomic Status of International Immigrants in Chile Through Hierarchical Cluster Analysis: a Population-Based Study
AN  - 1700674861; 201525163
AB  - Immigration to Chile is not large (just under 2% of the total population) but has increased in recent years. This study aimed to analyse the socioeconomic status (SES) of immigrants in Chile and compare it with the Chilean-born, by secondary data analysis of an anonymous nationally representative survey (CASEN, 2006). Immigrants are categorized into Low, Medium and High SES through hierarchical cluster analysis. Around 1 per cent of the total sample are international immigrants; an additional 0.7 per cent did not report their migration status. Self-reported immigrants show great variability in their SES. Immigrants in the Low SES cluster appeared to be significantly younger than those in Medium and High SES, also more likely to be children, women and belong to an ethnic minority. Immigrants in the Low SES cluster appeared similar to the unemployed, poorest Chilean-born but are more than eight years younger on average and more likely to be female. Immigrants to Chile are a unique group, with socio-demographic characteristics that differ significantly from the Chilean-born population, but there is great heterogeneity and complexity within this group. Cluster analysis provided a meaningful interpretation of the multidimensional concept of SES and allowed the identification of a vulnerable group of Low SES immigrants to Chile.

T1  - Paths of Integration for Sexual Minorities in Korea
AN  - 1735655209; 201536933
AB  - The prevailing social model among the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) in South Korea is to maintain somewhat sexually free but separate social enclaves. This strategy avoids significant public backlash and government oppression. However, the situation leaves them without legal protection, social acceptance or significant public space for expressing their sexual identity. Supporters of greater integration pursue a politically activist model, which advocates government recognition and protection of the LGBT as an oppressed minority. This strategy faces determined opposition from some Christian groups and a mostly indifferent public. We highlight a complementary 'bridging-dialogue' model in which individual LGBT persons nurture communicative social ties with members of the larger society in ostensibly non-political settings. Although emerging and limited, the bridging strategy attracts many more participants than does identity politics and generates genuine dialogue and other social exchange among different groups, including conservative Christians and foreign-origin LGBTs. Bridging dialogue also appeals to a younger generation of Koreans, who are more tolerant of and curious about ethnic and sexual diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - After innocence: Perceptions of individuals who have been wrongfully convicted
AN  - 1700675458; 201526029
AB  - Although it is easy to assume that individuals who have been wrongfully convicted are stigmatized, research has not systematically examined this issue. This research compares perceptions of individuals who have been wrongfully convicted to perceptions of offenders to investigate the stigma that wrongfully convicted persons report. Participants were randomly assigned to complete surveys regarding their attitudes, stereotypes, and discrimination tendencies towards one of three different groups: individuals who were wrongfully convicted of a crime, actual offenders, or people in general (control). Results suggested contemptuous prejudice towards offenders and wrongfully convicted persons. In comparison to the control group, individuals who had been wrongfully convicted were stereotyped more negatively, elicited more negative emotions, and were held at a greater social distance. Although participants did report greater pity for wrongfully convicted persons than others, this pity did not translate into greater assistance or support. Perceptions of wrongfully convicted persons appear similar to negative, stigmatized views of offenders. Individuals faced stigma and discrimination even after exoneration.

T1  - Argentine Migrants to Spain and Returnees: A Case for Accumulation of Civic Assets
AN  - 1700674812; 201525210
AB  - Conceptually, this paper relies on the asset accumulation framework and identifies its relevance to work on Argentine migrants to Spain and returnees. The asset accumulation framework represents an innovative approach to understanding the complexities of migratory flows in a transnational context. In order to comprehend and tackle migration, this framework pays particular attention to investment and savings in various domains, including the financial, social, human, civic and political fields. Responding to gaps in current studies, the objective of this paper is twofold. First, it expands the asset accumulation framework by differentiating between civic and political assets. Second, using data drawn from interviews conducted among Argentine migrants and returnees in the cities of Barcelona and Buenos Aires, this paper fleshes out the definition of civic assets. The findings indicate that, for interviewees, moving to Spain implied the accumulation of civic assets that enhanced the development of a more equitable and democratic society. Respondents incorporated new civic capabilities in several areas, including increased environmental awareness and tolerance for minority groups, as well as the acquisition of knowledge about equity and labour rights. In addition, results suggest that, as a result of the migratory experience, many interviewees went through reflective processes that made them question their old presumptions about both the receiving and sending societies.

T1  - Asian American Attitudes towards a US Citizenship Path for Illegal Immigrants: Immigration Reform as Racialised Politics
AN  - 1680154296; 201514058
AB  - Do Asian Americans view a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA as related to perceptions of shared interests with other ethnoracial groups? I utilise the National Asian American Survey to test this possibility. Ordinal logistic regressions reveal that higher levels of perceived political commonality with Latinos relate to increased support for the provision of a citizenship path. Similarly, higher perceived political commonality with blacks is positively related to support for a citizenship pathway, suggesting that a civil rights frame, rather than a group competition frame, links immigration reform and black political interests in the minds of Asian Americans. On the other hand, higher levels of perceived political commonality with whites relate to increased opposition to such a pathway. These results indicate that Asian Americans' racial attitudes, in particular their perceptions of political commonality with other racial groups, relate to their opinions on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA.

AN  - 1667950767; 201509440
AB  - The examination of student group performance is a constant need as American higher education continues to expand and become more racially and ethnically diverse. Recent scholarship on the academic performance of Black students at elite colleges and universities has glossed over possible disparities among these students, particularly among different immigrant groups. The current study clarifies these differences in academic performance by examining four Black student groups at elite colleges and universities in the United States: native Blacks, Black immigrants from Africa, Black immigrants from the Caribbean and Latin America, and Black immigrants from other parts of the globe. The analyses point to many similarities and differences among the four Black student groups in their characteristics and influences on their academic performance in college such as gender, precollege friendships, high school academic preparation, college major, and closeness to Whites and Blacks. Additionally, this study found evidence of possible colorism among Black students at elite colleges. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A sociofunctional approach to prejudice at the polls: are atheists more politically disadvantaged than gays and Blacks?
AN  - 1566612531
AB  - Prejudice against atheists is pervasive in the United States. Atheists lag behind virtually all other minority groups on measures of social acceptance. The sociofunctional approach suggests that distrust is at the core of anti-atheist prejudice, thus making it qualitatively different than prejudice against other disadvantaged groups. Accordingly, this research examined political bias against atheists, gays, and Blacks and the affective content accompanying such biases. Results indicated that atheists suffered the largest deficit in voting intentions from Christian participants, and this deficit was accompanied by distrust, disgust, and fear, thereby suggesting that the affective content of anti-atheist prejudice is both broader and more extreme than prejudice against other historically disadvantaged groups. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

T1  - The Political Candidacy of EU Migrants in their European Countries of Residence. The Case of British and Romanians Standing in Spanish Local Elections
AN  - 1660022496; 201505579
AB  - What explains the variation in how European citizens of diverse origins are politically incorporated in the member states of residence? This paper argues that immigrant groups' status in the host society plays an important role in political party responses to immigrants' political participation. Drawing on the case of Romanian and British candidacies in the Spanish local elections from 2011, the paper finds that the level of competition between parties is the key mechanism for incorporating candidates from a positively/neutrally perceived group. Instead, a greater level of ethnic diversity encourages the incorporation of candidates from the negatively perceived group. To demonstrate this, the paper uses an original data-set with the Romanian and British candidates in a large number of Spanish localities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ulster Protestants in New Zealand: A Bibliographic Essay
AN  - 1660019721; 201505656
AB  - One of the most noticeable aspects of recent studies which examine Irish migration to New Zealand has been the identification of a sizeable contingent of Ulster Protestant settlers within that migrant stream. Their presence has proven to be a complicating factor in how the history of the Irish in New Zealand has been written and has made easy assumptions about the loyalty, identity, politics and ethnicity of that population impossible. This essay surveys the existing literature on New Zealand's Ulster Protestant population across a wide range of subjects while at the same time considering their apparent disappearance as a distinct ethnic grouping in the new world. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious Affiliation and Attitudes Towards Gay Men: On the Mediating Role of Masculinity Threat
AN  - 1544524207
AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians.

T1  - Citizenship, enclaves and earnings: comparing two cool countries
AN  - 1559005378; 201432000
AB  - This paper uses the Canadian 2006 Census and the Swedish 2006 register data to analyse the citizenship effect on the relative earnings of immigrants, using instrumental variable regression to control for citizenship acquisition. We ask: 'Is there a citizenship effect and if any, in which country is it that we find the largest effect and for which immigrant groups?' We add one further dimension, asking if the size of the co-immigrant population in the municipality has an effect on earnings. We find that the impact of citizenship acquisition is substantial in both Canada and Sweden. However, the place of birth of immigrants is important. In most cases, immigrant women in Sweden enjoy a higher citizenship premium than is the case for immigrant women in Canada. Amongst men the picture is more mixed. Most European groups receive a larger citizenship premium in Canada as compared to Sweden. Being in a city with more immigrants of the same background is better for earnings in Sweden than in Canada. However, being in a city with a lot of immigrants (regardless of origin) is better in Canada as compared to Sweden. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do Institutions or Culture Determine the Level of Social Trust? The Natural Experiment of Migration from Non-western to Western Countries
AN  - 1531931121; 201423336
AB  - Do institutions or culture determine levels of social trust in society? If quality of institutions determines levels of social trust, migrants from countries with lower-quality institutions should enhance their level of social trust in countries with higher-quality institutions. If, on the other hand, the migrants' level of social trust is determined by their culture, it should not be affected by a different institutional setting. Furthermore, culturally diverse immigrant groups should have different levels of social trust in the same host country. Analysing migration from several non-western countries to Denmark, this paper demonstrates that institutions rather than culture matter for social trust. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority nations and attitudes towards immigration: the case of Quebec
AN  - 1507339807
AB  - Growing international migration constitutes a tremendous challenge for contemporary democracies, no more so than for minority nations. An important challenge for the latter is one of acceptance of immigration from the native-born population, in a context in which immigrant can be seen as both a cultural and a political threat. In this article we ask what explains attitudes towards immigration in minority nations. More specifically, we seek to provide answers to these questions: What is the impact of cultural insecurity on attitudes towards immigration in minority nations? Is strong attachment to a minority nation associated with less positive attitudes towards immigration? And finally, are proponents of independence for minority nations more likely to favour a reduction in the level of immigration than those who oppose it? The article seeks to answer these questions by exploring the case of Quebec.   [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Does Moral and Social Conventional Reasoning Predict British Young People's Judgments About the Rights of Asylum-Seeker Youth?
AN  - 1559004938; 201432015
AB  - Since the nearly universal ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (U.N. General Assembly), children's rights have received increasing empirical attention. While there is an established body of research on how youth view their own rights, few studies have examined their views about the rights of out-group members. Employing a social-cognitive domain approach, the current study investigated British young people's (N = 260) views regarding the rights of asylum seekers. The data come from a secondary analysis of interviews on British young people's views about the religious and nonreligious rights of asylum seeker youth. Rather than being influenced by broader variables such as age, participants' judgments, and reasoning took into account the features of the specific rights situation under consideration. Moreover, the use of moral justifications was related to endorsing the rights of asylum seekers while social conventional justifications pertained to rejecting asylum seeker's rights. The implications for theory, future research and social policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patterns in Account-Giving among White Collar Criminals
AN  - 1520336638; 201411562
AB  - Using Swedish entrepreneurs' own explanations, this article searches for the possible regularities in the accounts offered by white collar offenders and for the underlying factors that produce these regularities, tracing in particular the impact of these offenders' attitudes toward regulation and taxation as well as their perceptions of the functioning of the market in which they operate. The results show that justifications are more common among offenders who have a clearly negative view on both factors. Excuses, on the other hand, are more frequently used by those who hold a positive attitude toward taxation and regulation. The results also show that offenders who offer excuses tend to share the same negative perception of the market as the 'justifiers.' This unanticipated finding suggests that the 'excusers' commit their offenses because they believe that the unlawful behaviors of the relevant others disturb the functioning of the market mechanism and thereby push them toward criminality.

T1  - The presence of the past: youth, memory making and the politics of self-determination in southeastern Nigeria
AN  - 1520341093; 201413366
AB  - This article focuses on recent reconstructions of Igbo 'memory' by the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign state of Biafra (MASSOB). MASSOB is a second-generation Igbo separatist movement that draws on a collection of 'memory repertoires' to agitate for the self-determination and exit of the Igbo ethnic group from the Nigerian state into an alternative political and administrative arrangement known as the Republic of Biafra. The core issues relate to dual narratives generated by the Nigerian-Biafran War. While the state shapes the official history, memories and narratives of the war to suit its own vision, interests and politics, MASSOB contests these official views as the sole legitimate framework for remembering and interpreting the war, but still connects to the war as a war of Igbo national liberation. These contestations provide the context for the enactment of memory claims and counterclaims, and their association with political violence in contemporary Nigeria. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - ATTITUDES TOWARDS MUSLIMS ARE MORE FAVORABLE ON A SURVEY THAN ON AN IMPLICIT RELATIONAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE (IRAP)
AN  - 1718067479; 201530636
AB  - Sugar ingestion bolsters cognitive resources, which should improve ability to inhibit expressing socially undesirable responses on explicit measures, including surveys. In this study, undergraduates drank regular or diet root-beer, then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) followed by an Anti-Muslim Prejudice Scale (AMPS). The IRAP indicated neutral attitudes about Muslims and positive attitudes about Westerners. However, the AMPS indicated significant pro-Muslim attitudes. There was no significant effect of drink on the AMPS. However, participants who drank regular root-beer showed stronger anti-Muslim bias on the IRAP. Increased bias following sugar ingestion may reflect a discrepancy between implicit and explicit measures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Honk Against Homophobia': Rethinking Relations Between Media and Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1504423546; 201405549
AB  - The theory of 'symbolic annihilation' or 'symbolic violence' has been used in academic literature to describe the way in which sexual minorities have been ignored, trivialized, or condemned by the media. This article aims to de-center research from issues of media representation to consider the capacity for minority groups to proactively use new media and its various avenues for interactivity, social networking, and feedback to fight social exclusion. This work suggests that new media has become a space in which the nominally marginal in society may acquire 'social artillery'-a term used to describe how sexual minorities utilize their expanding and more readily accessible social connections in digital space to combat instances of homophobia. The research draws on the results of an inquiry into the relation between media and a regional youth social justice group in Australia tackling homophobia. The research demonstrates that the group is becoming increasingly adept and comfortable with using a cross-section of media platforms to fulfill their own objectives, rather than seeing themselves as passive subjects of media representation. This article argues that this sets an example for other socially excluded groups looking to renegotiate their relation with the media in regional areas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Life-course Perspective on Adolescents' Attitudes to Police: DARE, Delinquency, and Residential Segregation
AN  - 1494299675; 201404508
AB  - Objectives: Describe the developmental trajectory of perceptions of the police by youth as they transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Method: A longitudinal experiment to evaluate the impact of the D.A.R.E. program (N = 1,773). Latent variable growth modeling was used. Results: A dramatic decline in the favorable attitudes of youth toward the police begins in about seventh grade. More negative perceptions of police are associated with minority racial status, negative experiences with officers, involvement in the delinquent subculture, and greater expressions of skewed legal norms. There is a long-term positive effect of D.A.R.E. on attitudes toward the police, particularly for African American youth. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of theorizing about perceptions of the police from a life course perspective. Findings raise new policy questions about the long-term impact of school-based programs, such as D.A.R.E., and the role of multiple reference groups in the formation of minorities' attitudes. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the cognitive and experiential processes involved in attitude formation.

T1  - Ethnic Politics in Ranked and Unranked Systems: An Exploratory Analysis
AN  - 1512218132; 201408801
AB  - This article explores how ethnic politics may operate differently in societies with 'ranked' versus 'unranked' ethnic systems, where ethnicity and class correlate closely versus very little. It focuses on two hypotheses suggested, but not tested, in Donald Horowitz's Ethnic Groups in Conflict. Their plausibility is explored in seven brief case studies of electoral politics in South America and Southern Africa. The analysis suggests that theories of ethnic politics that fail to take class into account are problematic for the study of ranked societies in particular. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race and the Religious Contexts of Violence: Linking Religion and White, Black, and Latino Violent Crime
AN  - 1463007814; 201345881
AB  - Research has demonstrated that concentrated disadvantage and other measures are strongly associated with aggregate-level rates of violence, including across racial and ethnic groups. Less studied is the impact of cultural factors, including religious contextual measures. The current study addresses several key gaps in prior literature by utilizing race/ethnic-specific arrest data from California, New York, and Texas paired with religious contextual data from the Religious Congregations and Memberships Survey. Results suggest that, net of important controls, (1) religious contextual measures have significant crime-reducing associations with violence; (2) these associations are race/ethnic specific; and (3) religious contextual measures moderate the criminogenic association between disadvantage and violence for blacks. Implications for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Other Backward Class Muslims of West Bengal, India: A Sociological and Social Anthropological Insight
AN  - 1512219945; 201408816
AB  - Sociological and social anthropological studies on the Muslim society in India with particular reference to the Other Backward Class (OBC) Muslims of West Bengal are negligible causing a vast lacuna and immense loophole in our perception and understanding of not only the OBC Muslims of West Bengal, but also the Indian Muslim community as a whole from an empirical point of view. The analysis presented in this paper is a modest attempt to examine the socio-economic characteristics of Muslims in West Bengal, India, through an analysis of available statistics of socio-economic characteristics and resulting social stratification among the Muslims within the context of the larger Indian Society. Muslims constitute a minority community with approximately 13% of the billion strong Indian population, thus they are one of the largest Muslim minority communities in the world. However, they continue to have lower scores on socio-economic indices across all indicators which will be presented and analyzed in this paper. The paper also highlights the socio-economic backwardness of the Muslims with special reference to the Muslim OBCs of West Bengal from a historical perspective. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexuals' Attitudes Toward Transgender People: Findings from a National Probability Sample of U.S. Adults
AN  - 1357002397
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S. adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and correlates of men's and women's attitudes toward transgender people. Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender people are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Interethnic Friendship, Trust, and Tolerance: Findings from Two North Iraqi Cities
AN  - 1520331108; 201413449
AB  - This article examines correlates of social trust and tolerance within a high-violence context. The authors study first the extent to which friendship ties that cross ethnic boundaries are associated with specific interaction spaces (neighborhoods, workplaces, civil society organizations, and political parties) and, second, the extent to which interethnic friendships are associated with trust and tolerance. Using individual-level data on interethnic contacts collected in 2006 in the two northern Iraqi cities of Erbil and Kirkuk, the authors show that people who spend time within ethnically heterogeneous interaction spaces are considerably more likely to have friendship ties that cross ethnic group boundaries and, in turn, also to express general social trust, interethnic trust, and tolerance toward outgroups.

T1  - THE AMBIVALENT GIFT
AN  - 1429636595; 201335752
AB  - The question of who holds responsibility for racial uplift within African American communities is an enduring one. This paper investigates the understanding of racial obligation on the part of Black elite philanthropic donors. Through in-depth interviews with twenty elite donors, I investigate whether African American elite donors use philanthropic activity to realize their racial obligations by supporting Black nonprofit organizations and charitable causes that directly benefit Black people. I find that Black donors are deeply ambivalent about their position as members of a racial group that is marginalized while they are individually privileged because of their class position. They attempt to reconcile this ambivalence through their philanthropic giving. Donors at times embrace the importance of their racial identity as a principle that organizes their giving practices, but in other instances the very same donors reject race as a factor orienting how they think about their charity. Donors express this inconsistency through three different giving strategies. First, Black donors advocate for what they consider to be Black causes within mainstream organizations-initiatives they believe will directly and positively benefit Black people. Second, while they may support Black nonprofit organizations, they qualify the types of Black organizations worthy of their support. Third, donors reject race as an orienting principle altogether. Indeed, while there are few distinctive patterns among Black elite donors, no matter how they give they do so with an eye towards maintaining a mainstream sensibility that emphasizes integration, efficiency, and success. It is perhaps the diversity of contradictory strategies that poses the most fundamental challenge to the notion of community that permeates discussions of race and responsibility. I conclude by arguing that the ability to define when and how race matters to them is a particular privilege of the Black elite. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Xenophobia among Youngsters: The Effect of Inter-Ethnic Contact
AN  - 1417520513; 201331831
AB  - This study examines xenophobic attitudes of secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. This study builds upon a previous research in three ways. First, attitudes of pupils from both the ethnic majority and minority groups are examined. Second, the impact of positive as well as negative inter-ethnic contacts both within and outside the school environment is determined. Finally, hypotheses about inter-ethnic contacts are tested while simultaneously reckoning with alternative mechanisms that might explain xenophobic attitudes. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses show that the level of xenophobia is lower when pupils evaluate their inter-ethnic contacts as positive, and higher when they perceive these contacts as negative. However, the impact of positive inter-ethnic contact in class disappears or even reverses when multiculturalism is more emphasized during lessons. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The attitudinal consequences of thought suppression: A focus on thinness thoughts
AN  - 1773421261
AB  - Four studies examined whether thought suppression could enhance attitude accessibility and whether behaviours that are consistent with the more accessible attitudes would follow. Thinness was examined as the attitude object. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that suppression of positive thoughts about thinness increased the accessibility of the positive attitudes associated with thinness. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that suppression of positive thinness thoughts also elicited more health-promoting behaviours. The implications of the findings for attitude accessibility and the practical consequences of thought suppression are discussed.

T1  - To pay or not to pay? Do extrinsic incentives alter the Kohler group motivation gain
AN  - 1364701233; 201323142
AB  - The Kohler effect is an increase in task motivation that occurs in performance groups when one is (a) less capable than one's fellow group members, and (b) one's efforts are particularly indispensable for group success. Recently, it has been shown that the Kohler effect can dramatically increase one's motivation to exercise. The present study examines the potential moderating effect of the provision of extrinsic incentives on such Kohler motivation gains. When participants were offered such an extrinsic incentive for persisting at an exercise task, a robust Kohler effect was observed-participants who thought they were the less capable member of a dyad working at a conjunctive-group exercise task persisted 26% longer than comparable individual exercisers. But an even stronger effect (a 43% improvement) was observed when no such incentive was on offer. Possible explanations and boundary conditions for this moderating effect are discussed.

T1  - TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE OR NOT: DEPENDENCE ON KNOWLEDGE-SHARING SATISFACTION
AN  - 1531931370; 201423171
AB  - Knowledge sharing behavior does not occur naturally and easily. In this study, Wu hypothesized that knowledge workers would be more likely to share knowledge if they were satisfied with knowledge-sharing behavior. This positive attitude was labeled knowledge-sharing satisfaction (KSS). Drawing upon social exchange theory and motivation theory, Wu examined the relationship between KSS and knowledge-sharing behavior. Using survey data from participants employed in research and development departments at knowledge-intensive high-technology companies in Taiwan, Wu demonstrated that satisfaction of the need for a friendly sharing environment and satisfaction of intrinsic and altruistic motivation are positively related to knowledge-sharing behavior. These findings contribute to researchers' understanding of the antecedents of employee knowledge-sharing behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The performativity of colour blindness: race politics and immigrant integration in France, 1980-2012
AN  - 1551002144; 201428901
AB  - France is usually conceived of as an assimilationist country, where national identity is based on principled colour-blind values. The emergence of values running counter to the dominant French model during the 1980s and 1990s has therefore led to the formation of two dominant positions in the literature: advocates of the path-dependent nature of models have refused to acknowledge the existence of structural and durable dissonances with this formal colour blindness a la francaise, while the epigones of Gunnar Myrdal have only seen a contradiction between formal colour-blind principles and the actual treatment of minority groups in France, described in terms of a 'French dilemma'. Both positions are unsatisfying insofar as they fail properly to articulate the co-existence of, on the one hand, principles of colour blindness that have saturated public discourses in France over the last 30 years and, on the other, the no less omnipresent framing of French citizens with postcolonial immigrant origins in public and political discourses in racial and ethnic terms. To overcome this difficulty, Bertossi suggests we look at the mutually supportive relationship between colour blindness and the culturalization of French citizenship, and examine how the performative effects of the French colour-blind model have produced a framing of membership and identities in ethnic and racial terms in contemporary France. This analysis focuses on two different settings in which these effects can be observed: first, the official narrative on French citizenship, as provided by a series of public reports on immigrant integration published over the last three decades; second, the negotiations on ethnic and racial diversity in the French military after the end of conscription in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

T1  - Determinants of Perceived Immigrant Job Threat in the American States
AN  - 1266055641
AB  - In the United States, the 2000s were marked by record numbers of immigrants and heightened levels of pro- and anti-immigrant agitation. As a result, research investigating anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and other societies has surged. In this article, the authors investigate the determinants of perceived immigrant job threat in the fifty U.S. states in 2005. They draw upon three theoretical perspectives that dominate the study of prejudice--group threat theory, contact theory, and cultural theory--but move beyond these established theories to adduce three new perspectives, which they label economic competition, labor market deregulation, and globalization. The authors find support for all six perspectives. The three new perspectives augment, rather than supplant, the traditional theories. The authors find that levels of perceived immigrant job threat tend to increase in settings where there is economic stagnation, where labor unions are growing weaker, where the minimum wage is low, and where corporate restructuring has taken place.

T1  - Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals
AN  - 1283641062; 201303101
AB  - Although biases against homosexuals (and bisexuals) are well established, potential biases against a largely unrecognized sexual minority group, asexuals, has remained uninvestigated. In two studies (university student and community samples) we examined the extent to which those not desiring sexual activity are viewed negatively by heterosexuals. We provide the first empirical evidence of intergroup bias against asexuals (the so-called "Group X"), a social target evaluated more negatively, viewed as less human, and less valued as contact partners, relative to heterosexuals and other sexual minorities. Heterosexuals were also willing to discriminate against asexuals (matching discrimination against homosexuals). Potential confounds (e.g., bias against singles or unfamiliar groups) were ruled out as explanations. We suggest that the boundaries of theorizing about sexual minority prejudice be broadened to incorporate this new target group at this critical period, when interest in and recognition of asexuality is scientifically and culturally expanding.

T1  - When nasty breeds nice: Threats of violence amplify agreeableness at national, individual, and situational levels
AN  - 1347783381; 201318578
AB  - Humans have perennially faced threats of violence from other humans and have developed functional strategies for surviving those threats. Five studies examined the relation between threats of violence and agreeableness at the level of nations, individuals, and situations. People living in countries with higher military spending (Study 1) and those who chronically perceive threats from others (Study 2) were more agreeable. However, this threat-linked agreeableness was selective (Studies 3-5). Participants primed with threat were more agreeable and willing to help familiar others but were less agreeable and willing to help unfamiliar others. Additionally, people from large families, for whom affiliation may be a salient response to threat, were more likely than people from small families to shift in agreeableness. Returning to the national level, military spending was associated with increased trust in ingroup members but decreased trust in outgroups. Together, these findings demonstrate that agreeableness is selectively modulated by threats of violence. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Immigrant Networks in New Urban Spaces: Gender and Social Integration
AN  - 1221407852; 201243977
AB  - This article investigates how dispersed settlement in areas of urban sprawl affects the structure of personal networks that in turn influences the likelihood of social integration among male and female immigrants from Taiwan. Settlement in the deconcentrated spaces that currently constitute the new urban spaces of U.S. metropolitan areas potentially offers more opportunities to interact with ethnically diverse people than the traditional ethnic enclaves of inner cities. However, these spatial structures also increase dependency on cars and road systems. Findings from ethnographic fieldwork in Orange County, California, show that the social networks of affluent first generation immigrants from Taiwan are not comparable to the densely knit broadly based ties linking neighbors and kin group members traditionally attributed to immigrants. Instead, the social networks of immigrants with high levels of human and economic capital are based on loosely bounded, sparsely knit, and dynamic specialized ties. At the local level networks involve few ties to extended relatives, but a substantial amount of relationships with former classmates and members of recreational associations. However, despite good English skills and employment in diverse workplaces the number of interactions with nonimmigrants outside of work and school environments is rather small. These circumstances are experienced differently by men and women. Female immigrants consider living in the deconcentrated spaces of master-plan communities beneficial for achieving personal contentment. They welcome the changed conditions for social interaction and enjoy the decrease in network size and frequency of contacts that result in less obligations and responsibilities compared to life back in their country of origin. Male immigrants, however, mourn the loss of opportunities to gain reputation and social recognition. They would prefer to live in areas with close spatial proximity of immigrant residences. These gendered evaluations further affect the likelihood of social integration for first generation immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The impacts of friendship groups' racial composition when perceptions of prejudice threaten students' academic self-concept
AN  - 1417522448; 201333530
AB  - Literature on racially prejudiced stereotypes suggests that students' academic self-concepts (ASC) can be damaged when a stereotype demeans the intelligence of their racial or ethnic group. There is little research on how students overcome this burden, but there is some evidence that the racial composition of friendship groups play a role. One argument suggests having racially diverse friends could help students see the inaccuracy of stereotypes and another points out that racially homogenous friends could collectively resist the stereotypes as a support group. In this study I analyze a nationally representative and racially diverse sample of United States adolescents to examine these hypotheses. After estimating multivariate regression models for four separate racial/ethnic groups (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, white), results show that although perceptions of prejudice do predict decreases in ASC for African-American students, racially homogenous friendship groups have the opposite effect which lends credibility to the support group hypothesis. In addition, racial diversity of friendship groups predicts decreased ASC for African-American students, suggesting diverse groups could make prejudice more salient. The implications for these findings include the reminder that prejudice is still a valid concern in American schools and that peers can be a significant source of racial tension and/or support. In terms of students' ASC, it is important for educators to be aware of these social conditions and to continue to seek a better understanding of race relations in schools so that more students are not psychologically burdened by racial tension.

AB  - This article gives an historical perspective to debates on xenophobia and immigration in South Africa after 1994. It contrasts contexts for immigration and the establishment of claims of belonging within the changing multiculturalisms of apartheid and "the rainbow nation." It discusses different types of identity tactics deployed by immigrant groups in their struggles for recognition within these contexts. Finally, it compares the development during the twentieth century of the use of transnational Indian Ocean networks to support simultaneous claims for national and transnational belonging, as exemplified by groups of Cape Muslims and Durban Zanzibaris.

T1  - The Impact of Anti-Immigration Policies and Perceived Discrimination in the United States on Migration Intentions among Mexican Adolescents
AN  - 1650148181; 201502128
AB  - This exploratory study examined whether higher levels of perceived discrimination against Mexican immigrants in the United States (USA) were related to the migration intentions of Mexican adolescents. I drew the data for this study from a sample of 755 from a total of 980 adolescent students surveyed in Tijuana, Mexico in February 2009, who indicated they had some interest to migrate to the USA to either live or work in the USA. There were 392 male participants (51.9%) and 363 female participants (48.1%), with a mean age of the participants of 16 years. Over 65 per cent of the participants were born in Tijuana, Mexico and over 62 per cent of the participants indicated that their families had very low to average socio-economic status, as measured by an SES scale. The majority of participants' mothers (74.2%) and fathers (68.6%) had less than a high school education. Multivariate OLS regressions were run controlling for gender, age and socio-economic status. Results indicated that higher levels of perceived discrimination in the USA were a moderately significant predictor of lower migration intentions among Mexican adolescents who identified that they wanted to live or work in the USA, but higher levels of perceived discrimination did not significantly predict lower migration intentions among participants, who indicated that they felt they had to move to the USA to work and support their families.

T1  - Re-making the majority? Ethnic New Zealanders in the 2006 census
AN  - 1283642662; 201303368
AB  - The national census is often seen as a site of struggle for minorities seeking recognition and equality. Much less is known about the conditions under which ethnic majorities are galvanized to stake identity claims in the census. This article examines recent trends in New Zealand where an increasing number of people from the dominant New Zealand European group are redefining themselves as ethnic New Zealanders. Drawing from the literature on ethnic boundaries, we theorize the factors underlying the surge in New Zealander identification, and present census data to demonstrate its selective appeal. We also review patterns of national naming in North America and Australia to show that the New Zealander phenomenon reflects a broader shift by settler state majorities to reimagine their identities. The implications for ethnic counting in other contexts are briefly considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Observer Perceptions of Moral Obligations in Groups With a History of Victimization
AN  - 1037878947; 201234135
AB  - The authors investigated when observers assign contemporary group members moral obligations based on their group's victimization history. In Experiment 1, Americans perceived Israelis as obligated to help Sudanese genocide victims and as guiltworthy for not helping if reminded of the Holocaust and its descendants were linked to this history. In Experiment 2, participants perceived Israelis as more obligated to help and guiltworthy for not helping when the Holocaust was presented as a unique victimization event compared with when genocide was presented as pervasive. Experiments 3 and 4 replicated the effects of Experiment 1 with Cambodians as the victimized group. Experiment 5 demonstrated that participants perceived Cambodians as having more obligations under high just world threat compared with low just world threat. Perceiving victimized groups as incurring obligations is one just world restoration method of providing meaning to collective injustice.

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Capacity and Solidarity: Foundational Elements in the Unionization Strategy for Immigrant Day Labourers
AN  - 1037877807; 201231018
AB  - Recent scholarship has been reasonably optimistic about unionization as a mechanism of labour justice for immigrant workers in casual and contingent work. This optimism rests on two assumptions: (1) that unions have the capacity to absorb immigrant workers in nonstandard work and (2) that casual, immigrant labourers enjoy the kind of solidarity that underpins collective action. This paper examines these assumptions critically through a case study of construction unions and Latino immigrant day labourers in Denver, Colorado and Baltimore, Maryland. I use participant observation and in-depth interviews with nine labour unions, 19 Latino immigrant day labourers, and two (non-union) day labour organizing projects in the cities to examine questions of capacity and solidarity. I find that the existing foundations for unionizing day labourers may be weak in certain cities and communities. Union capacity is undermined by structural fragmentation and specialization in market segments that are inaccessible to day labourers. Strategically, in an age of de-unionization, unions also face pressures to "add value" for employers by sorting the workforce into high quality and low quality categories. Locals indicate day labourers would likely fall into the latter category, thus precluding membership. The foundations for solidarity are similarly weakened in the cases studied. Culturally, day labourers in Denver and Baltimore emphasize self-reliance and material well-being over collective action and the pursuit of justice. To work toward unionization, organizers should be prepared to confront deficits of capacity and solidarity in other cities as well, especially those where homelessness is prevalent among day labourers, where immigrant populations are newly arrived, or where local union cultures are unreformed. I suggest that union collaboration, a cooperative type of occupational unionism, and commitments to training day labourers may help boost union capacity to absorb day labourers, while the creative use of material incentives should figure prominently in organizing strategies.

T1  - In perfect harmony: Synchronizing the self to activated social categories
AN  - 1347785859; 201318462
AB  - The self-concept is one of the main organizing constructs in the behavioral sciences because it influences how people interpret their environment, the choices they make, whether and how they initiate action, and the pursuit of specific goals. Because belonging to social groups and feeling interconnected is critical to human survival, the authors propose that people spontaneously change their working self-concept so that they are more similar to salient social categories. Specifically, 4 studies investigated whether activating a variety of social categories (i.e., jocks, hippies, the overweight, Blacks, and Asians) increased associations between the self and the target category. Whereas Studies 1 and 2 focused on associations between stereotypic traits and the self, Studies 3 and 4 examined self-perceptions and self-categorizations, respectively. The results provide consistent evidence that following social category priming, people synchronized the self to the activated category. Furthermore, the findings indicate that factors that influence category activation, such as social goals, and factors that induce a focus on the interconnectedness of the self, such as an interdependent vs. independent self-construal, can impact this process. The implications of changes to the working self-concept for intergroup relations are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Sociology as bridge over troubled waters: establishing a link between the principles of lesbian and gay studies and queer theory
AN  - 1322715338; 201310829
AB  - Lesbian and gay studies emerged in the late 1950s and provided what several academics considered a homogeneous representation of the lesbian and gay community. Based on the critique of this view, queer theory came to the fore during the early 1990s, as a political initiative to highlight the diverse nature of homosexual experiences. Both paradigms heralded indefatigable insights into the lives of these two sexual minorities, yet without a necessary bridge between the homogeneous and the heterogeneous. The objective of the article is to provide a theoretical contemplation of how the manner in which the principles that lesbian and gay studies and queer theory respectively exude, may complement each other so as to offer a link between the 'homogeneous' and the 'diverse', pertaining to the lived experiences of gay men and lesbian women.

T1  - Perception of Insecurity in French Poor Neighbourhoods: Racial Proxy or Pure Discrimination Hypotheses
AN  - 1023028579; 201227006
AB  - Many poor neighbourhoods, home to both socially disadvantaged populations and to foreigners, are characterised by a strong perception of insecurity. The purpose of this article is to determine the origin of this perception. To do so, two possible causes are dissociated: racial prejudice and racial proxy (the ethnic minorities are perceived in terms of the negative social characteristics that are often associated with them). More specifically, it is shown that the 'ethnic' variable captures the effects of an overconcentration of poverty, approximated here by the concentration of unemployment, but that these two variables act separately. This result should be taken into account in the policies implemented by public authorities and local actors. In this study, an original methodology is applied based simultaneously on individual geocoded data, the proportion of foreigners, the unemployment rate at the neighbourhood level and an indirect indicator of perceived insecurity.

T1  - Revisiting the Underclass Debate: Contemporary Applications to Immigrants and Policy Implications
AN  - 1018352422; 201212829
AB  - The "underclass" concept pervades social science research on poverty, racial relations, and more recently, immigration. In this article, we elaborate and extend Massey's critique of the underclass concept by briefly reviewing the history of this concept and emphasizing its contemporary application to immigrants and undocumented workers. We also explore how the term as well as popular variants, including the "rainbow underclass," are ambiguously defined yet legitimated by contemporary researchers and, as a result, have become more deeply embedded in social science scholarship. Furthermore, we critique the prevalent use of this term in describing minority groups and highlight its potential to reaffirm individualistic, racist views of immigrants while obscuring social processes that perpetuate inequality. We conclude with a call to scholars and policy analysts to replace this term with pointed analyses of the structural conditions that shape the lives of disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Metropolitan Structure and Neighborhood Attainment: Exploring Intermetropolitan Variation in Racial Residential Segregation
AN  - 916888459; 21863366
AB  - Using data from the 1981, 1991, and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and several decennial censuses, we examine how characteristics of metropolitan areas are associated with black and white households' neighborhood racial composition. Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20% to 40% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations.

T1  - Measuring ethnic polarization
AN  - 914767736; 201200139
AB  - An ethnic polarization index is a measure of the extent to which individuals in a population are distributed across different ethnic groups. The objective of this article is to develop some characterizations of the Reynal-Querol (RQ) index of ethnic polarization using alternative sets of independent axioms. A generalized form of RQ is also characterized. Some implications of the axioms are investigated as well. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial diversity and change in metropolitan neighborhoods
AN  - 887501266; 201118112
AB  - This study investigates the changing racial diversity and structure of metropolitan neighborhoods. We consider three alternative perspectives about localized racial change: that neighborhoods are bifurcating along a white/nonwhite color line, fragmenting into homogeneous enclaves, or integrating white, black, Latino, and Asian residents into diverse residential environments. To assess hypotheses drawn from these perspectives, we develop a hybrid methodology (incorporating the entropy index and majority-rule criteria) that offers advantages over previous typological efforts. Our analysis of 1990-2000 census tract data for the 100 largest US metropolitan areas finds that most neighborhoods are becoming more diverse and that members of all groups have experienced increasing exposure to neighborhood diversity. However, white populations tend to diminish rapidly in the presence of multiple minority groups and there has been concomitant white growth in low-diversity neighborhoods. Latino population dynamics have emerged as a primary force driving neighborhood change in a multi-group context. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Making Bengali Brick Lane: claiming and contesting space in East London
AN  - 914767210; 201200131
AB  - Based on a recent empirical project on 'the Bengal diaspora', the paper explores the construction and contestation of meanings around the iconic East London street, Brick Lane. Taking the 2006 protests around the film Brick Lane as its starting point, the paper draws on original interviews conducted in 2008 with a range of Bengali community representatives, to examine the narratives of space, community and belonging that emerge around the idea of Brick Lane as the 'cultural heartland' of the British Bangladeshi community By exploring the representation, production and contestation of 'social space' through everyday practices, the paper engages with and contests the representation of minority ethnic 'communities' in the context of contemporary multicultural London and examines the process of 'claiming' and 'making' space in East London. In so doing, the paper contributes to a critical tradition that challenges essentialising and pathologizing accounts of ethnic communities and racialized spaces, or that places them outside of broader social and historical processes -- redolent, for example, in contemporary discussions about 'parallel lives' or 'the clash of civilizations'. By contrast, this paper views social space as made through movement and narration, with a particular emphasis on the social agency of local Bengali inhabitants and the multiple meanings that emerge from within this 'imagined community'. However, rather than simply stressing the unfinished and processual nature of spatial meanings, the paper insists on the historical, embodied and affective dimensions of such meaning making, and a reckoning with the broader social and political landscape within which such meanings take shape. The focus on Brick Lane provides an empirically rich, geographically and historically located lens through which to explore the complex role of ethnicity as a marker of social space and of spatial practices of resistance and identity. By exploring Bengali Brick Lane through its narratives of past, present and future, these stories attest to the symbolic and emotional importance of such spaces, and to their complex imaginings.

T1  - Adolescent girls' race/ethnic status, identities, and drive for thinness
AN  - 862595346; 201109600
AB  - Using data from 7272 adolescent US girls, we explore how girls' race/ethnic group status affects their bodyweight, perceptions of overweight, and weight control practices. We hypothesize that a girl's race/ethnic status influences her basic identity which in turn prompts her to adopt or reject a "drive for thinness." After controlling for family and peer support, school engagement, family SES, maturation, and family structure, we find that girls' race/ethnic status influences their susceptibility to the thinness ideals of mainstream culture. African American girls weigh more than Asian, Hispanic, or White girls, but at any given weight they perceive themselves as overweight and attempt to control their weight less. Asian American and White girls invest most in thinness dynamics. Some evidence also suggests girls from lower SES families are less driven to be thin. Our results affirm the utility of viewing material bodies as "situations" that are experienced and interpreted in accord with identity group relations and dynamics. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Negativity and Outgroup Biases in Attitude Formation and Transfer
AN  - 919905251; 201201562
AB  - In an initial experiment, the behavior of one person had a stronger influence on implicit evaluations of another person from the same group when (a) the attitude was negative rather than positive and (b) the people were outgroup members rather than ingroup members. Explicitly, participants resisted these attitude transfer effects. In a second experiment, negative information formed less negative explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and participants were more vigilant not to transfer that negative attitude to a new Black person. Implicit attitudes, however, transferred to both Black and White targets. Positive information formed stronger positive explicit attitudes when the target was Black than when the target was White, and that evaluation transferred to another Black person both implicitly and explicitly. Even when deliberately resisting outgroup negativity in attitude formation and transfer, people appear unable to avoid it implicitly.

T1  - 'Why don't you get somebody new to do it?' Race and cultural taxation in the academy
AN  - 856402911; 201106890
AB  - There has been a marginal increase in the number of racial minorities among college and university faculty, yet current attacks on affirmative action and prevailing attitudes about the inferiority of non-white faculty place an extra burden on these individuals in academia. Amado Padilla (1994) introduced the concept of 'cultural taxation' to describe this burden where additional responsibilities are placed upon non-white faculty because of their ethno-racial backgrounds. These responsibilities include serving on numerous committees, advising larger numbers of students and serving as 'departmental experts' for their particular ethno-racial group. These expectations of non-white faculty are not placed as heavily upon white faculty, can impede career progress and affect job satisfaction. In this paper, we explore how cultural taxation affects faculty of colour in a research university. Additionally, we expand the analysis of cultural taxation to include issues of legitimacy that challenge non-white faculty's sense of 'belonging' within their respective departments.

T1  - Cultural Identity, Multicultural Competence and Resilience: A Pilot Study of Alaska Native Students' Experience at University
AN  - 1030869319; 201227883
AB  - Scholars and university administrators have noted significant disparities in the rates at which Native students graduate from college in a timely manner relative to students from other racial/ethnic groups. It has been posited that this is because in order to succeed, Native students must negotiate the contradictory values of Western and Native cultures as they "walk in two worlds." The cultural processes that are employed by a small number of Alaska Native students suggest that the "two worlds" metaphor is deceptive and that a more holistic, nuanced sense of cultural identity can promote youth resilience in response to sociocultural differences and difficult life events that Native students experience in college.

T1  - Generation and Earnings Patterns Among Chinese, Filipino, and Korean Americans in New York
AN  - 1023024787; 201223938
AB  - By treating the 1.5 generation as a distinctive analytic category, this paper compares the effects of generational status on earnings among men of Chinese, Filipinos, and Korean descents in the New York metropolitan area. Our analyses of the 5 percent Public Use Microdata Sample data of the 2000 U.S. census show that all other background characteristics held equal, 1.5-generation Chinese and Filipino American workers make significantly higher earnings than second-generation workers. However, Korean American workers do not exhibit this 1.5-generation advantage. These findings support a segmented assimilation theory, the view that immigrant assimilation paths are not uniform across ethnic groups or generation status. Other findings suggest that bilingual ability would increase earnings only for the Chinese group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - CHANGES IN SPATIAL PATTERNS OF THE IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF A SOUTHERN EUROPEAN METROPOLIS: THE CASE OF THE BARCELONA METROPOLITAN AREA (2001-2008)
AN  - 1010631493; 201210560
AB  - To date, the evolution of residential segregation patterns in southern European cities has received little attention. The case of Barcelona metropolitan area (BMA) is particularly relevant following a rapid growth of immigrant population over a very short period. This empirical study seeks to see if this rapid growth has changed the spatial segregation patterns of immigrant groups and led to the emergence of ethnic enclaves. First, we calculate five indices according to the classic dimensions of residential segregation. Then, we use an adapted version of the Poulsen etal. typology in order to identify ethnic enclaves. In the period under study, there was a general increase in two dimensions: Exposure and clustering. There was a decline in evenness and concentration, and a variety of situations in terms of centralization. The evolution of the segregation indices indicates a diversity of segregation patterns: an increase of segregation according to exposure and clustering dimensions, a decline in evenness and concentration, and a variety of situations in terms of centralization. Finally, the findings confirm the presence of ethnic enclaves following seven years of growth in the immigrant population. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Latina Girls' Peer Play Interactions In A Bilingual Spanish-English U.S. Preschool: Heteroglossia, Frame-Shifting, And Language Ideology
AN  - 875716309; 201115297
AB  - The current English-only educational climate in California presents children with polarizing discourses about national belonging (Bailey 2007). This study uses language socialization theory (e.g., Garret and Baquedano-Lopez 2002) and Bakhtin's (1981) concept of "heteroglossia" to examine how members of a peer group of linguistic minority children attending a bilingual Spanish-English preschool in California used bilingual practices among themselves to respond to such polarizing discourses and organize their local peer group social order. The peer group was followed over several months during free play in their preschool classroom using methods of ethnography and talk-in-interaction. An extended episode of birthday play was examined. The children use code-switching as a resource to negotiate locally shifting "frames" (Goffman 1974) and participation frameworks (C. Goodwin 2007; M.H. Goodwin 1 990a; 2006) during their play interaction. Through their language practices, group members reflexively portray the tension between their languages (Bakhtin 1981), and inscribe some domain associations (Garrett 2005; Paugh 2005; Schiefilin 2003) for English and Spanish (e.g., using English for references to aspects of birthday parties relevant to U.S. consumer culture; Spanish for topics of food and family). These practices reproduce hierarchical and gendered rankings of the languages inscribed in monolingual discourses of the dominant U.S. society. However, the children also challenge regimented patterns, through using, at moments, unmarked forms of code-switching, often within single utterances. These hybrid utterances blur boundaries across frames and groups of players, affirming "linguistic and cultural hybridity" (Haney 2003: 164) within the peer group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 1883033939
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis.

T1  - Emotional and self-esteem consequences of perceiving discrimination against a new identity group
AN  - 758122789; 201056804
AB  - With a sample of Asian international students, the consequences of perceiving pervasive discrimination against one's in-group were examined by experimentally manipulating perceived discrimination (pervasive vs rare) and group identification (low vs high). We report evidence that supports and integrates aspects of two contrasted models; namely, the discounting model and the rejection-identification model. Consistent with both models, the effects of perceiving discrimination on one's psychological well-being depended on the level of group identification. Nevertheless, after reading about pervasive discrimination, low (vs high) identifiers reported less depressed affect, consistent with the discounting model. However, they also reported lower self-esteem, consistent with the rejection-identification model. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Out of Sight, Out of Mind? Patterns of Transnational Contact Among Chinese and Indian Immigrants in Toronto
AN  - 754045403; 201053314
AB  - There has been considerable discussion in recent decades about the integration patterns of new immigrants. Recognizing advancements in technology and the increased economic integration of countries, some researchers have suggested that the emerging integration trend for immigrants is the transnational pattern, whereby immigrants maintain contact with the home countries. To advance the discussion, this study focuses on general transnational contact, a basic form of transnational activity. The study draws from recently collected large-scale survey data to explore the patterns of transnational contact within two recent immigrant groups, Asian Indians and Chinese, in Toronto. Our findings show that only a small percentage of immigrants maintain intensive and extensive transnational contact. As well, our findings are less consistent with the transnational perspective than with the assimilation perspective on the effects of socioeconomic background on transnational contacts.

T1  - Can perceptions of similarity reduce the ability to see the other's needs? The case of immigrant students' integration policy
AN  - 1417522638; 201332065
AB  - In this age of wide migration waves all over the world, when schools' populations become more diverse, educators often make policies regarding groups of immigrant students (from the same origin) with unique needs. Perceptions of homogeneity of the group, as well as perceptions of similarity between the decision maker and the group members are likely to have a major influence on these policies. Although research has shown that perceptions of great similarity between the decision maker and a target group enhance empathy and promote decisions in favor of the group; results of the current research, examining immigrant students' integration policy in schools, suggest that inaccurate high similarity perceptions (on a relevant domain) might decrease the ability to understand the targets' diverse needs and may lead to decisions that do not serve the group, or the decision maker's goals. Two studies were conducted to examine the effect of perceived homogeneity and similarity on immigrant integration policy in schools. In the first study, lay people recommended fewer programs for immigrants students when those where judged to be more similar to themselves and more homogenous. Similar results were obtained in the second study, examining school principals' reports of existing programs for immigrant students in their schools. Implications on policy making are discussed.

T1  - What Do You Mean by "European"? Evidence of Spontaneous Ingroup Projection
AN  - 1928266841
AB  - The ingroup projection model posits that group members project ingroup features onto a superordinate category. The present research aimed at isolating the cognitive underpinnings of this process. If ingroup projection is a spontaneous cognitive process, a superordinate category prime should facilitate the processing of the ingroup prototype rather than the outgroup prototype. Three studies support this hypothesis by comparing subliminal semantic priming in two different populations, an intra- versus intergroup situation, and with an ingroup prototype manipulated by changing the intergroup context. Results indicated that the superordinate category prime facilitated the processing of ingroup rather than outgroup traits (Experiment 1) and that these traits depended on the particular content of the ingroup prototype made salient by different contexts (Experiments 2 and 3). The findings indicate that the cognitive representation of the superordinate category is based on ingroup traits and that this representation is context dependent.

T1  - Embracing and Resisting Ethnoracial Boundaries: Second-Generation Immigrant and African-American Students in a Multicultural University
AN  - 743066414; 201043264
AB  - The transformation of college campuses related to the growing presence of minority youth and the arrival of second-generation immigrants offers opportunities for exploring the formation of social and cultural boundaries and ethnoracial identities in local multicultural contexts. Absent from many discussions of the merits of multicultural college settings is specification of the interactional processes and cultural transformations that presumably lie at the heart of diversity payoffs. This project focuses on students from four minority groups, three of whom are second-generation immigrants, in a racially diverse university, combining focus groups and in-depth interviews. First, we analyze how the social mixing practices of students congeal into ethnoracial boundaries on campus. We find that two images of multiculturalism ('fragmented pluralism' and 'interactive pluralism') play out simultaneously on this campus. Second, we examine the pathways leading to more insular ethnoracial mixing and toward more heterogeneous social mixing, as well as explore the cultural meanings of these practices in student narratives. We also compare the influence of campus context, student agency, and internal and external group pressures on varying degrees of student satisfaction with their achieved social worlds.
