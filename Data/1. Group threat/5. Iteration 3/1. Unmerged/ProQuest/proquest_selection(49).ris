T1  - The Social Image of Families of Children and Youth in Residential Care: A Characterization and Comparison With Mainstream Families With Different Socioeconomic Status
AN  - 2283929107
AB  - The literature suggests that families of children and youths in residential care are often associated with negative social images. These images may shape prejudiced attitudes and behavior toward them and, when shared by care professionals, compromise the effectiveness of family intervention and reintegration. This study explored these social images in a sample of 176 participants with and without professional contact with this population. Participants were asked to indicate five attributes describing families of children or youths living in residential care or in mainstream environments with low or medium socioeconomic status (SES). Results indicated that both families of children and youths in residential care and families of low SES were predominantly described with negative attributes. However, only the former were characterized by dysfunctional parenting-related attributes. Medium SES families were overall described with positive attributes. Furthermore, these social images were organized in different profiles. Implications for family intervention and reintegration are discussed

T1  - Examining the role of perceived prestige in the link between students’ subjective socioeconomic status and sense of belonging: GPIR
AN  - 2205313026
AB  - Low socioeconomic status (SES) students have a lower sense of belonging to college than high-SES students. Due to the importance of sense of belonging in the college pathway, understanding the reason for this relation is particularly important. Here, we argue that in addition to having less access to resources, low-SES students in the college context also perceive themselves as having lower prestige than their high-SES counterparts. Thus, in the present research, we tested perceived prestige as a mediator of the link between subjective SES and sense of belonging to college. We conducted 3 studies in 2 different countries (USA and China), and these investigations provided evidence that the lower students’ subjective SES, the lower their self-attributed prestige, and that prestige mediated the relation between students’ subjective SES and their sense of belonging to college. The implications of these findings for understanding the collegiate experience of low-SES students are discussed.

T1  - Different forms of intergroup contact with former adversary are linked to distinct reconciliatory acts through symbolic and realistic threat
AN  - 2178496160
AB  - In a society burdened with the most severe type of intergroup conflict, we examined the association between willingness to reconcile with former adversary, intergroup contact with, and perceived threat from former adversary. We focused on three reconciliatory acts—forgiveness to the outgroup, support for ingroup apology and support for financial compensation to the outgroup. We included different forms of positive and negative intergroup contact—direct and indirect (extended and mass‐mediated). In the link between contact and reconciliation, we tested the mediating role of two types of intergroup threat—realistic and symbolic. The sample comprised Bosniaks (N = 267) and Croats (N = 278) from Bosnia and Herzegovina. In both samples, reconciliation associated with indirect forms of intergroup contact even when controlling for its link with direct contact. This indicates the potential of indirect contact to promote reconciliation in the lack of direct contact, characteristic for segregated post‐conflict societies. Symbolic threat mediated the relationship between intergroup contact and symbolic forms of reconciliation—forgiveness and support for ingroup apology. Realistic threat mediated the link between intergroup contact and a more tangible form of reconciliation—support for financial compensation. This highlights the importance of considering different types intergroup threat when targeting distinct reconciliatory acts. Our results suggest that practitioners promoting reconciliation in post‐conflict societies need to implement different means when tailoring interventions that should enhance different sides of peace‐making process.

T1  - "Authentically Black, and Truly Catholic": A survey of the study on Black Catholics
AN  - 1945438699
AB  - Black Roman Catholics have been a contributing community to American culture as far back as the nation's founding. Despite nearly three million Black Catholics in the United States today, sociological research has given little consideration to this community. This review makes a case for more sociological focus on Black Catholicism. I review the available sociological research on Black Catholics and include a review of scholarship on Black Catholics from outside the discipline. I argue for the sociological importance of Black Catholicism to the examination of race, religion, and identity formation.

T1  - Racial Discrimination, Racial Socialization, and Crime: Understanding Mechanisms of Resilience
AN  - 1925175128
AB  - Taking a “strength approach” to African American families and cultures, recent research demonstrates that familial racial socialization provides resilience to the criminogenic effects of interpersonal racial discrimination among Black youth. Building on these nascent findings, the present study takes a process-oriented approach to understand how racial socialization reduces and counteracts the effects of discrimination on offending. Building on a social schematic theory of offending (Burt and Simons 2011), this study explores whether two social psychological factors, positive racial identities and spirituality, serve as mechanisms through which racial socialization provides resilience. We test our hypotheses with structural equation models using data from the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS), a longitudinal, multisite study of roughly 700 African American youth and their primary caregivers followed from late childhood to early adulthood. Consistent with our theoretical model, findings suggest that familial racial socialization practices provide resilience to the criminogenic effects of racial discrimination in large part by increasing positive racial identities and spirituality. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - Issue Introduction: Identity Concealment: Multilevel Predictors, Moderators, and Consequences
AN  - 1910720929
AB  - Over the past 20 years, research on the experiences of people who are targeted by prejudice and discrimination has grown dramatically (for reviews see Major & O’Brien, 2005; Puhl & Heuer, 2009; Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009). This research has shown the power of stigma to affect many life outcomes including psychological distress, physical health, and academic achievement (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). The bulk of the research, however, has focused on visible stigmatized identities, primarily race and gender. In the current issue, we focus on stigmatized identities that can be concealed. Concealable stigmatized identities are socially stigmatized identities that have the potential to be hidden from others. Some examples include minority sexual orientation, history of mental illness, chronic illness, substance abuse, and a criminal record. Previous work has shown that people with concealable stigmatized identities experience many of the same negative outcomes as people with visible identities, despite the fact that the stigmatized identity can be kept secret. For example, adolescents with minority sexual orientation have higher rates of suicidality and depression compared to their heterosexual peers (Marshal et al., 2011); people with a history of depression have higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than those without depression (Bradley & Rumfeld, 2015); students with a history of mental illness who attend college are less likely to graduate than those without a mental illness history (Kessler, Foster, Saunders, & Stang, 1995).

T1  - Possibility, legitimacy, and the new ontologies of choice: a comment on Brubaker
AN  - 1900934926
AB  - In Trans, Rogers Brubaker makes a major argument about the contentious politics of the contemporary self. In this commentary, I first lay out what is think is the solidity of the book's contrasting tableau of the functioning of race and gender in American society and beyond. I then point to Brubaker's bundling together of issues of legitimacy and issues of ontology and begin to imagine what alternative analyses can come out of their unbundling - suggesting that race and gender are perhaps more analogous social formations than Trans argues. Finally, I bring attention to the role of ontological hierarchy in the formulation and policing of identity claims and conclude that the return of biology and the new empire of choice may not be two parallel, independent developments but one and the same process. Theoretically, I amplify one of the book's epistemological contributions by calling for a reflexive turn in social-constructionist thought.

T1  - Ethnic Chinese in Malaysian citizenship: gridlocked in historical formation and political hierarchy
AN  - 1883571435
AB  - The ethnic Chinese in Malaysia are a significant minority who call for a critical assessment as far as their cultural identity and political positioning are concerned. Appropriating the concept of 'multicultural citizenship', this article attempts to dissect various demands and aspirations of the ethnic Chinese in Malaysia's multiracial hierarchy. It suggests that using the lens of multicultural citizenship can help shed light on Malaysian Chinese as well as the entire nation, where ethnicity and citizenship are gridlocked in historical formation and political hierarchy. In recent times, Malaysian Chinese have articulated their political desires and demands in order to get rid of the disgrace of racial constraints, and also to envisage a more inclusive multicultural citizenship for Malaysia as a nation-state. This article also compares and contrasts three Chinese public figures who have taken disparate stands and approaches with regard to language, culture, race, nation, and party politics.

T1  - Disunited in ethnicity: the racialization of Chinese Mainlanders in Hong Kong
AN  - 1883149588
AB  - In the current climate of increasing antagonisms and populist discontents surrounding the visible presence of mainland mobilities in postcolonial Hong Kong, there is an acute need to understand how those from Mainland China are racialized. Lowe and Tsang's article provides an examination of the campaign against Mainlanders prevalent in Hong Kong society. The emergent conflicts between Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese migrants overlap with the duality of time or differing time-inflected cultural habits of Mainlanders and Hong Kongers. As Hong Kong's citizenry and Mainlanders contest the status of the former colony and claim rights over it in ways aberrant to both factions' national consciousness, discrimination increases as Mainlanders are castigated by Hong Kongers for grazing their territory with mannerisms deemed unsettling to Hong Kong's everyday notions of time and space. Hong Kongers' sense of collective identity is shored-up as they reject the People's Republic of China's favoured concept of pan-Chinese ethnicity by constructing Mainlanders as the inverse of themselves.

T1  - 'Thinking ill of others without sufficient warrant?' Transcending the accuracy-inaccuracy dualism in prejudice and stereotyping research
AN  - 1877774268
AB  - Research on prejudice seeks to understand and transform inaccurate beliefs about others. Indeed, historically such research has offered a cautionary tale of the biased nature of human cognition. Recently, however, this view has been challenged by work defending the essential rationality of intergroup perception, a theme captured controversially in Jussim and colleagues' (2009) research on the 'unbearable accuracy of stereotyping'. The present paper argues that in its own terms the 'rationalist turn' in socio-cognitive research on stereotyping presents an important challenge to the prejudice tradition, raising troubling questions about its conceptual and empirical foundations. However, it also argues for the necessity of transcending those terms. By focusing on the correspondence between individual beliefs and the supposedly 'objective' characteristics of others, we neglect the historical and discursive practices through which the social realities that we 'perceive' are actively constructed and institutionalized. We mask their social origins, contested and perspectival nature, relativity, and relationship to wider structures of power. By implication, moving beyond the Allportian perspective that has dominated both the prejudice tradition and the emerging stereotype accuracy paradigm, we may now need to prioritize other kinds of questions. Reversing Allport's famous definition of prejudice, it may now be time to ask: How, and with what consequences, does 'thinking ill of others' become sufficiently warranted? How does such thinking become part of institutionalized relations of power and an accepted way of perceiving, evaluating and treating others? What should social psychologists be doing to challenge this state of affairs?

T1  - Perceived in-group discrimination by first and second generation immigrants from different countries of origin in 27 EU member-states
AN  - 1854785141
AB  - This article analyses perceived in-group discrimination of 29,189 first and second generation immigrant respondents from 201 different countries of origin currently living in one of 27 EU countries. In addition to testing effects of individual factors, the article estimates the effects of macro-characteristics of both origin and destination countries and community variables. The migration history of these groups is relevant for perceived discrimination: immigrants with citizenship, who speak the majority language at home and have at least one native parent perceive less in-group discrimination, whereas religious respondents, especially from religions that differ more in comparison to the majority, perceive more in-group discrimination. Furthermore, macro-characteristics of the country of origin are most important in explaining differences between European countries. Immigrants from socio-economically more developed countries with higher living standards - and for that reason more comparable to the native population - are less likely to perceive in-group discrimination.

T1  - Ultranationalist discourses of exclusion: a comparison between the Hungarian Jobbik and the Greek Golden Dawn
AN  - 1836613032
AB  - In this paper I present the extensive discourse analysis of texts produced by the electorally exceptionally successful Greek and Hungarian ultranationalist parties. I first demonstrate that although both have adopted the topics, arguments and rhetorical figures of racist discourse, they differ in the relative importance they attach to culture and biology. That is, while GD imposes rigid, impermeable boundaries to a nation bound together by the ties of common ancestry, excluding 'others' on grounds of purported racial inferiority, Jobbik focuses more on culture as the dominant marker that separates off 'us' from 'them'. I then try to explain the emergent patterns by relating them to context-specific categorisation strategies as well as the historically constituted conceptions of 'Greekness' and 'Hungarianness'. I show that the construction of 'otherness' is markedly different in the two societies in terms of the chosen 'enemies', the preferred identity-markers as well as the processes of boundary drawing. The findings demonstrate that we need to think in a more differentiated way about the possible configurations of the culture/biology and difference/superiority nexus as shaped by the historically constituted and deeply rooted perceptions of difference in each context.

T1  - From colonial categories to local culture: Evolving state practices of ethnic enumeration in Oceania, 1965-2014
AN  - 1824036937
AB  - Numerous scholars have examined how governments in particular times and places have classified their populations by ethnicity, but studies that are both cross-national and longitudinal are rare. Using a unique database of census questionnaires, we examine state practices of ethnic enumeration over a 50-year period (1965-2014) in the 24 countries and areas that comprise Oceania. The region's extraordinary linguistic and cultural diversity, combined with its complex colonial history and indigenous politics, make it an ideal site for comparative analyses. We find a shift from biological conceptions of difference to a more cultural understanding of group identity, exemplified by a sharp rise in language questions and the decline of race-based inquiries. While local identity labels have largely displaced colonial categories, the imprimatur of previous regimes still lingers, particularly in Melanesia. These shifts in official constructions of ethnoracial differences reflect a gradual lessening of colonial influences on demographic practices.

T1  - Differing shades of colour: online dating preferences of biracial individuals
AN  - 1807591287
AB  - The racial and ethnic makeup of the United States has become increasingly diverse over the past few decades. Growing rates of interracial dating and marriage have led to an increasing number of biracial individuals. Despite increasing rates of biracial individuals, research on this population specifically in relation to dating preferences, remains limited in scope. In order to assess biracial individuals' romantic partner preferences, the present research examines 1,203 Internet dating profiles drawn from Match.com. This study utilizes logistic regression to examine the willingness of biracial individuals to cross the colour line when seeking a potential romantic partner. The findings suggest that there are distinct racial dating preferences that reflect the presence of a triracial hierarchy. These results are examined in relation to how identity formation and racial stratification may play a part in shaping the racial/ethnic dating preferences of biracial individuals.

T1  - 'And You Need Me to Be the Token Mexican?': Examining Racial Hierarchies and the Complexities of Racial Identities for Middle Class Mexican Americans
AN  - 1800514240
AB  - This article examines the racial identities of middle class Mexican Americans, and provides a focus on how racial oppression plays a significant role in the formation, negotiation, and organization of these identities. This article sheds light on how Mexican Americans continue to experience racism despite being middle class and achieving socioeconomic parity with many middle class whites. Drawing on 67 semi-structured open-ended interviews (one to three hours each) in Phoenix and San Antonio this article shows how middle class Latinos/as negotiate racialized identities and racial oppression. This research concludes that these middle class Mexican Americans utilize different identity practices to navigate racism and racial hierarchies. These practices are attempts to access white coded middle class resources and to maintain and/or shift their positions in the race and class hierarchies of the USA.

T1  - The Postcolonial Female "Bildung" in Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes
AN  - 1795683286
AB  - This article positions itself in the literary representations of the convergence of slavery, migration, race, gender, growth, and the African identity in a neo-slave narrative. It concerns itself with the examination of Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes as a female bildungsroman written from a postcolonial perspective. The novel centers on the growth and experiences of the female protagonist, Aminata Diallo, an African slave who eventually becomes a notable personality involved in the registration of the Black Loyalists on their passage to Nova Scotia (Canada) in the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783). In addition, she assists in the resettlement of the Loyalists in Sierra Leone and testifies in London on behalf of the abolitionists against the trans-Atlantic slave trade. As a result, this study highlights the intersection of history and literature in addition to the experiences of Africans in the diaspora who struggle with character development and identity in different societies.

T1  - The Subject Effaced: Identity and Race in Django Unchained
AN  - 1795681292
AB  - Quentin Tarantino's stated ambition for Django Unchained was to create a film that grapples with "America's horrible past with slavery ... but do them like spaghetti westerns." This article considers the implications of those priorities -- a serious treatment of slavery on one hand, and reference to genre tropes on the other. It concludes that, although the spaghetti Western may be particularly well suited to depict the nihilistic and dehumanizing violence that undoubtedly characterized chattel slavery, the genre's resistance to the representation of human subjectivity mirrors the relative silence around the psychological dimension, not only of slavery, but also of continuing crisis of structural racism in the post-civil rights era. As such, through the specific narrative and aesthetic strategies he employs, Tarantino unwittingly undermines his own pretensions to social consciousness, producing instead a film that reflects and reproduces the ignorance, strategic silence, and White guilt surrounding America's ongoing history of slavery and racism.

T1  - Bosnia and the Middle East: Current Political, Economic and Cultural Ties
AN  - 1797943266
AB  - This article will review and analyze Bosnia's political, economic and cultural ties with the Middle East, most especially Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as the evolution of Muslim identity in that republic, especially since the late 1960s when there was an internal liberalization process in part influenced by Yugoslavia's policy on non-alignment. Today, Bosnians of all ethnic and religious backgrounds must contend with internal divisions and tensions exacerbated by the 1992-1995 war while utilizing a very cumbersome political system that may have brought peace at the expense of unity. Bosnia's geographical location draws that country toward the rest of Europe while history and the legacy of the Ottoman Empire, also draws Muslims toward the Middle East.

T1  - Framing PIGS: patterns of racism and neocolonialism in the Euro crisis
AN  - 1784145009
AB  - Van Vossole's article explores the racist framing of the peripheral member states of the European Union, the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland (and/or Italy), Greece and Spain). It demonstrates a strong connection between the processes of racialization and depoliticization, as well as the return of colonial dynamics in the Eurozone. Side-stepping political economy and history, the culturalization of politics perfectly complements the 'post-political' neoliberal hegemony. Political and media discourses reproduce it in both populist and corporate interests. The culturalization of politics reduces the differences between centre and periphery to certain 'cultural characteristics and habits', as reflected in stereotypes of laziness, non-productivity, corruption, wasteful spending and lying. These make it possible to blame the PIGS for the current crisis, legitimizing drastic austerity measures and a loss of sovereignty. The loss of sovereignty shows remarkable similarities with what Kwame Nkrumah defined as neocolonialism: the continuation of colonial power relations through processes of economic dependence, conditional aid and cultural hegemony. While this problematic only resurfaced during the recent Euro crisis, Van Vossole discusses how today's racist discourses and neocolonial politics have their roots in the past, particularly in anti-Irish and anti-Mediterranean racism and in the (semi-)colonial position of the PIGS in the British and Ottoman empires. Besides structural violence against the periphery, a major consequence of this racialization is that it jeopardizes any possibility of further democratic political integration on the basis of a common European identity.

T1  - Women in Movement: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1822649600
AB  - This essay seeks to define the course of Brazilian black women's struggle within the national feminist movement. It questions the classic feminist perspective founded on a supposedly universal notion of woman that takes Western white women as its paradigm, obscuring the perception of the multiple intra- and inter-gender contradictions brought about by racial issues. Given these contradictions, black women are called upon to establish themselves as a new political entity, bearing a new agenda that derives from a specific identity wherein the variables of gender, race, and class interact, posing new and more complex challenges to our society efforts in attaining equitability of gender and race.

T1  - Geographies of Power: Black Women Mobilizing Intersectionality in Brazil: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1822649594
AB  - In Brazil and throughout the African diaspora, rarely are black women, especially poor black women, considered leaders of social movements, much less political theorists. While Afro-Brazilian women are at the very heart ofthe struggle for urban housing and land rights in Salvador, the prevailing image ofblack women, particularly those who live in poor neighborhoods, is that they lack the knowledge and political sophistication needed to organize mass social movements. This article seeks to undermine this image by exploring how black women have come to radicalize local communities. It also explores why they are the main political actors interpreting the racial, gender, and class dynamics of urban development policies and fighting to reform projects of socio-spatial inclusion in cities. Bridging the scholarly gap between black feminist theorization and the grassroots practice of intersectionality, I argue that black women who organize as blacks, women, and poor people provide key insights into how intersectionality is mobilized for social and poltical change. Furthemore, the ethnographic focus on black women's activism illustrates the ways in which grassroots politics have advanced our understanding of intersectional identity formation in relationship to the material interests ofthe marginalized communities in Brazil.

T1  - A History of African Americans on the Water and by the Shore: Whitewashed and Recovered
AN  - 1764653815
AB  - Profiling the lives of Black surfers in California, the Pacific islands, Florida, and the Caribbean, the documentary film White Wash tells an important story of black cultural formation and expression in modern America, and challenges some of the most widely held assumptions about race and identity in popular culture today. Beautifully narrated by Ben Harper and Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter of The Roots, who also scored the film, White Wash is a testament to the power of leisure and sports to both challenge and transcend racial constructs. It takes as its subject one of the most quintessentially "white" sports in America today--surfing--and reveals its fundamentally multicultural origins and development, and its continued relevance to segments of black America today. Here, Kahrl addresses the question of how certain sports and activities came to be labeled "white" or "black" in the public's mind, and how the racialization of sports shaped and informed the meaning of racial difference for both whites and people of color in the Americas.

T1  - Racial Salience and the Consequences of Making White People Uncomfortable: Intra-Racial Discrimination, Racial Screening, and the Maintenance of White Supremacy
AN  - 1735658448; 201536924
AB  - Most sociological research on racial discrimination has had an 'inter-racial' focus. That is, researchers have been principally concerned with the disparate treatment that people of color receive relative to Whites in different social contexts. However, recent theoretical work emerging from legal studies suggests that an alternative conception of 'intra-racial' discrimination exists that extends beyond colorism. This theory of intra-racial discrimination stipulates that many organizations in the 'post-racial' era desire some measure of racial diversity. Yet, in their efforts to achieve this racial diversity they screen people of color based on their degree of racial salience. Whether a given person of color is hired, promoted, or in the case of college admissions, accepted, is a function of whether or not Whites within the organization consider them racially palatable, or not overly concerned with race. This creates an incentive for people of color to work their identity to allay any concerns among Whites that they may be too racially salient. In this paper I critically review this work and attempt to further buttress its claims by highlighting how this process has clear historical precedent. I conclude by showing how the audit method can be used to empirically examine this practice contemporarily. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Superdiversity and conviviality: exploring frameworks for doing ethnography in Southern European intercultural cities
AN  - 1680154754; 201514032
AB  - International migration contributes to increasing cultural diversity in many European cities. Historically, migration studies have focused on the integration of immigrants foregrounding race/ethnicity and identity issues, limiting our understanding of intercultural diversity. A new paradigm focusing on relational patterns among groups is emerging, highlighting the importance of mutual relations, interactions and influences among residents of different origins and backgrounds, including the experience of both immigrants and autochthonous populations. The notions of superdiversity and conviviality have significantly contributed to this debate. This paper discusses how both were methodologically operationalized in multi-sited ethnographies carried out in Lisbon and Granada, during 2009-2012. Superdiversity and conviviality are the main theoretical frameworks used to understand how interculturality is lived and experienced at the local level. We reflect on their strengths and weaknesses, unpacking common assumptions about race, ethnicity and culture, specifically looking at the negotiation of difference in intercultural events.

T1  - The Kurdish movement's EU policy in Turkey: An analysis of a dissident ethnic bloc's foreign policy
AN  - 1667948934; 201509417
AB  - This study aims to address a historical paradox: how can we understand the Kurdish movement's EU policy in the two decades subsequent to the end of the Cold War? I argue that the Kurdish movement has pursued two different approaches towards the EU (or Turkey's EU membership bid) in the last two decades. While the Kurdish movement adopted a pro-EU stance from the beginning of the 1990s until 2005, it situated itself in an in-between position towards the EU after that year. In the analysis of these two different periods, I will interrogate the role of the international system, the domestic setting, identity/difference and the relations of power in the Kurdish movement's EU policy.

T1  - Rewriting Singapore and rewriting Chineseness: Lee Guan Kin's diasporic stance
AN  - 1680154749; 201513910
AB  - This study proposes to view Lee Guan Kin (the former director of the Center for Chinese Language, Culture, and Division of Chinese at Nanyang Technological University) in the historical context in which the identity of Southeast Asian Chinese has transformed from overseas Chinese to ethnic Chinese, from Straits Chinese to Chinese Singaporeans. Based on the interview with Lee and the study of Lee's numerous publications, this article exemplifies Lee's enduring efforts on researching diasporic Southeast Asian Chinese and their ties with Chinese language and culture is a meaningful choice rather than an essentialist returning to 'roots.' In this article, Lee's continuous engagement with China, Chinese language, and culture is illustrated by analyzing Lee's assertion of 'doing justice' for Lim Boon Keng and Tan Lark Sye. Accordingly, this study is divided into four parts. First, the concept of Chineseness is reviewed and explored in the context of Southeast Asia. Second, the historical background of English-educated and Chinese-educated Chinese groups and their varying degrees of Chineseness are introduced. Then this study analyzes how Lee does justice for Lim Boon Keng, a baba who served as chancellor of Xiamen University for 16 years, and Tan Lark Sye, who was the founder of former Nanyang University. Lee believes that both prominent figures were unfairly and relentlessly treated by Chinese and Singaporean historiography, respectively, and therefore, Lee wants to do justice to them as a way to relocate their position in the context of Chinese diaspora and to redefine Chinese accordingly. Finally, this study argues that locality defines Lee's Chineseness, her relation with China, China studies, Chinese identity, or Chinese culture. While locality defines Lee's Chineseness, a diasporic stance characterizes her articulation, which challenged the homogeneous threat of identity imposed by the nation-state and the kind of Chineseness traditionally shaped by the authority of a sino-centric core.

T1  - Transforming Citizenship: Power, Policy and Identity
AN  - 1761675726; 201602155
AB  - If Mike Myers is correct that Canada is as 'subtle' as celery, it might seem an academic conference focused on the theme of Canadian citizenship would be a gathering around the bland. In actuality, the 23rd conference of the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association (CESA), and the fourth one sponsored jointly with the Association for Canadian Studies (ACS), demonstrated otherwise. Held at the University of Alberta in Edmonton from October 24-26, 2013, the conference was devoted to the theme of 'Transforming Citizenship: Ethnicity, Transnationalism and Belonging in Canada.' The papers, formal presentations, and informal discussions (some continuing long after the conference ended) reflected on the dynamism of Canada and Canadian citizenship in the twenty-first century. They also reflected on the riveting questions that can arise from a consideration of migration, belonging and political community 'across the pond,' 'north of the 49th parallel,' in none other than Canada. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Creolisation, Creolite, Martinique, and the Dangerous Intellectual Deception of 'Tous Creoles!'
AN  - 1700676384; 201525340
AB  - Glissant's approach to creolisation does pose pivotal questions especially when considered from the perspective of the Martiniquan experience. Privileging a pragmatic posture, it evidently does not account for the climactic symbolic discrepancy and unavoidable moral pressure that powerfully define the conscious and unconscious outlook on the respective African and European identity constituents as they are related to culture and race, which in turn determine the ethics of the said creolisation. The latter is unbendingly advocated as a process in which all parts are proportionally and 'categorially' analogous. Glissant proposed a project aiming at reshaping the way one does Relation in the world. He did so from the model elaborated by the epistemological work of the African, a party that is constantly disparaged. However, he does not do this party justice by making first and unembiguously explicit the particularizing nature of its work. The African critical philosophical contribution is not earnestly rendered. It is this African philosophical input that provides the process and its result, their substantial meaning and distinguishing specificity. I would therefore like to discuss the axiological implications of Glissant's pragmatic assertion to show how, carrying this pitfall, the formalization and systematization of creolisation sow confusion and exacerbate negationism as well as the everlasting sets of prejudice held against Africa as evidenced in Martinique.

T1  - From Carasovan to Croat: The 'Ethnic Enigma' of a (Re)Invented Identity in Romania
AN  - 1667951543; 201509469
AB  - This paper discusses a unique case in recent Romanian history of an identity shift from Carasovans to Croats and the complex socio-political context which made it possible. Given their debated ethnic origins, the identity of Carasovans is considered an 'ethnic enigma'. The aim of our research is to offer a critical interpretation of the dynamics of ethnic identification of the Carasovans. In particular, we discuss the processes of national and ethnic identification in order to reveal how the Carasovan community was recently reinvented along the lines of the Croat identity. In close connection to these processes, the paper examines the political, economic and cultural elements involved in the dynamics of Carasovans' self-identification. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'I Haven't Eaten If I Don't Have My Soup and Fufu': Cultural Preservation through Food and Foodways among Ghanaian Migrants in the United States
AN  - 1667951888; 201509666
AB  - Food and foodways play a key role in protecting and preserving cultural sustainability. The smell of familiar foods can instantly evoke a series of emotions and desires because food customs are carriers of identity, memory, and tradition, yet accessing recognizable foods is often difficult and challenging for migrants to the United States, because of lack of availability, cost, and a host of other factors. This essay considers the ways in which some West Africans from Ghana negotiate their surroundings-and identities-when obtaining African foods in America. It argues that cultural sustainability is attainable in the United States as a result of ethnic markets, gardens, and other food centers that serve as conduits between home and the host country.

T1  - (E)RACING SLAVERY
AN  - 1667949944; 201509662
AB  - Textbooks are explicitly racial texts that offer important insights into national memories of slavery and colonialism. The Dutch have long engaged in the social forgetting of slavery even as race served as an organizing principal during centuries of colonial domination of the Dutch West Indies and Suriname. While the Dutch have recently begun to address their history of enslavement, they have yet to sufficiently address how the discursive legacies of slavery continue to impact the lives of Afro-Dutch descendants of enslaved Africans and White Dutch in The Netherlands today. This paper uses qualitative content and discourse analytic methods to examine the depiction of slavery, The Netherlands' role in the slave trade and enslavement, and the commemoration of slavery in all Dutch primary school history textbooks published since 1980 to address questions of whether textbooks feature scientific colonialism to perpetuate The Netherlands' social forgetting of slavery in a nation that denies the existence of race even as racialized socioeconomic inequalities persist. A Eurocentric master narrative of racial Europeanization perpetuates Dutch social forgetting of slavery and scientific colonialism to both essentialize Afro-Dutch and position their nation squarely within Europe's history of enslavement even while attempting to minimize their role within it. Findings have important implications for both The Netherlands and all nations with histories of enslavement as the discourses and histories presented in textbooks impact generations of students, who shape local and national policy regarding racial minorities, racial identities, and ideologies.

T1  - 'Us' and 'them': the limits and possibilities of a 'politics of neurodiversity' in neoliberal times
AN  - 1692290806; 201521428
AB  - The neurodiversity movement claims that there are neurological differences in the human population, and that autism is a natural variation among humans - not a disease or a disorder, just 'a difference'. A 'politics of neurodiversity' is based on the claim that the 'neurodiverse' population constitutes a political grouping comparable with those of class, gender, sexuality or race. This paper considers the limits and possibilities of neurodiverse political activism, and concludes by calling for a politics of identity that does not depend on a politics of 'us' and 'them'.

T1  - 'We Are Determined to Be White Ladies': Race, Identity, and the Maryland Tradition in Antebellum Visitation Convents
AN  - 1684424497; 201518501
AB  - In April 1848, at the invitation of Richard Whelan, bishop of the Diocese of Richmond, eight nuns from the Baltimore Visitation Convent founded a colony for their order in Wheeling, Virginia. During the first decade in their new home, these women, and those who later joined them, endured numerous trials-including fire to the roof of their convent, chronic cholera fears, debilitating and mortal illnesses to key members of the community, a dearth of vocations for teaching sisters, hostility and threats of violence from anti-Catholic nativists, and, most perilous of all, local competition from a rival, non-Catholic female boarding school-before their foundation firmly established itself in this industrial town in the Upper Ohio Valley. Among the recurring problems the nuns faced were the sooty conditions stemming from the ubiquitous coal dust spouting from the iron mills of the so-called Nail City that not only polluted the air but settled everywhere on the convent grounds and its members. 'So we have Coal dust showers in Wheeling,' wrote one sister to her former convent, 'which is more than you can boast of in Blt. [Baltimore]. I had no idea it was so bad till I saw it with my own eyes. It's impossible to keep clothes and hands clean.'. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1559005059; 201431996
AB  - This review presents an overview of research on Black authenticity. As the definition of Black authenticity is often not made explicit in literature, the complexity and nuance of this cultural resource can be overlooked. We explore two trends of Black authenticity present within literature, which we label as commodifying realness and legitimating membership. Beyond offering a working definition and review of these trends, this review also attempts to highlight the importance of the interconnectedness between controlling images and individuals' negotiations of Black authenticity. We conclude by summarizing the importance of studying Black authenticity and suggesting future directions for research. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1551001240; 201429015
AB  - This article maps the trajectory of Indian migration broadly, and specifically to Australia, to first highlight the heterogeneity of the Indian diaspora, and second, to comprehend the impact of this heterogeneity on the homeland alongside recent events involving the diaspora, such as the highly publicised attacks on Indian students in Melbourne in 2009-2010. While there is abundant literature on the history of Indian migration, as well as on diasporic identity formations in a globalising context, the Indian-Australian migrant subject is a recent subject of media and academic interest. The 'new racisms' perspective is used to examine the mediation of the student attack issue through the comments of 'integrated' Indian-Australians in a random sample of Australian media outlets. Feature articles, news items and opinion pieces appearing in the media covering the student attacks are examined for mentions of, and comments from a carefully selected group of professional Indians living in Australia who are often cast as a 'model minority'. Conclusions are then drawn on how the remediation of India and its newly assertive commercial media offered by these comments effectively redraws a nation previously receiving limited coverage (literally and discursively) in Australia. What is significant here is not merely the 'de-wogged' views of a seemingly integrated minority, but also how oppositional readings (by way of diasporic cultural production) signal a way forward for the Indian diaspora's representation in Australia, as well as for its relations with both the home and host societies.

T1  - Are second-generation Filipinos 'becoming' Asian American or Latino? Historical colonialism, culture and panethnicity
AN  - 1520331312; 201413357
AB  - This article examines how second-generation Filipinos understand their panethnic identity, given their historical connection with both Asians and Latinos, two of the largest panethnic groups in the USA. While previous studies show panethnicity to be a function of shared political interests or class status, I argue that the cultural residuals of historical colonialism in the Philippines, by both Spain and the USA, shape how Filipinos negotiate panethnic boundaries with Asians and Latinos, albeit in different ways. Filipinos cite the cultural remnants of US colonialism as a reason to racially demarcate themselves from Asians, and they allude to the legacies of Spanish colonialism to blur boundaries with Latinos. While the colonial history of Filipinos is unique, these findings have implications for better understanding racialization in an increasingly multiethnic society -- namely, how historical legacies in sending societies interact with new racial contexts to influence panethnic identity development.

T1  - Black Faces, White Spaces: Adjusting Self to Manage Aversive Racism in South Africa
AN  - 1761678383; 201602165
AB  - This article focuses on conversations in which South Africans speak about their experiences of aversive racism in 'raced' spaces. The article interrogates experiences of aversive racism and argues that, for various reasons, racial segregation and less overt forms of racism remain entrenched in South Africa. Presently, those subjected to such racisms actively shift, challenge and critically respond to the racial insults and aggressions. It is argued that such responses (as discussed in Michel Foucault's The hermeneutics of the subject) are a form of self-care requiring complex 'identity work' for those defined in racial terms. In the post-apartheid context, aversive racism is palpable in spaces still defined as 'white'. Black people (that is all those who would have been officially defined as such under apartheid) obtain differential 'access' to 'white' spaces and are forced to 'adjust' self to achieve belonging, respect and status. The conversations also suggest that moving across racial boundaries is difficult and problematic because to be 'authentic' and therefore acceptable, one must hold and demonstrate a stable identity. Secondly, moving across may involve loss, the burden of assuming a new identity and the profound discomfort of occupying an unfamiliar social space. For a younger generation of South Africans embedded in a globalising world, such shifts are potentially less traumatic, since global and hegemonic aesthetics make space for multiple situated identities.

T1  - The Mediating Role of Racial Socialization Processes on the Relations Between Organized Activity Involvement and Black Racial Identity
AN  - 1728660817; 201534244
AB  - The aim of the study was two-fold: First, the researcher sought to examine the direct links between organized activity involvement and multiple domains of Black racial identity (i.e., assimilation, miseducation, self-hatred, anti-white sentiment, Afrocentricity, multi-culturalist inclusivity) as evident on the Cross Racial Identity Scale (CRIS). Second, given the possibility racial socialization may occur in organized activity contexts, the researcher investigated various forms of racial socialization (i.e., alertness to racism, racial and religious coping, cultural legacy, cultural pride, interracial coping) as potential mediators of these activity-identity links. All study data was gathered from students at a Historically Black College or University. Evidence for direct and partially mediated associations between organized activity and racial identity were reported. Results are discussed and recommendations for future research are offered.

T1  - A Comparative View of Ethnicity and Political Engagement
AN  - 1622295917; 201438391
AB  - This article reviews approaches to ethnicity and political engagement, with particular emphasis on Western Europe. It argues that studies were at first marked by a structuralist approach and later turned to a more culturalist understanding of ethnic mobilization. Also, owing to increased labor migration after World War II, researchers shifted their attention from ethnic separatism to the ethnic identifications and mobilizations of migrants. While the political mobilization around (or based on) ethnicity was long seen as a disruptive factor within states, then also as a resource or barrier for migrant political involvement within national contexts, it is now studied under the auspices of increasing transnationalism, too. Simultaneously, religion, and especially Islam (in the European context), has come to be seen as one of the most important markers of identity and difference in European societies. This article's theoretical reflections concentrate on the juxtaposition of these two developments -- increasing transnationalism and the (re)emergence of religion as a relevant boundary marker. To analyze these shifts, the article contrasts three theoretical approaches with regard to ethnicity: theories of integration, resource mobilization theory, and the political opportunity structures approach. It suggests the revision of the traditional understanding of integration as nationally bounded, and it highlights the need for new perspectives for the study of ethnicity and political participation in the context of globalization.

T1  - Being 'Nesian': Pacific Islander Identity in Australia
AN  - 1622294426; 201438406
AB  - Pacific Islanders in Australia use the terms 'Islander' and 'Pacific Islander' in many ways and in different circumstances to define themselves and others. Through invoking discourses including these terms, Pacific Islanders both consciously draw on 'panethnicity' and subconsciously strengthen and support their localized identities. In this way, Pacific Islanders blur the ethno-cultural and sociopolitical boundaries that traditionally separate groups with connections across a diverse range of countries. Indeed, diasporic settings give rise to transnationalist sentiment and actions and serve to strengthen panethnic identity. Using insider and auto-anthropology and ethnographic research techniques, I draw on my experiences as an Australian of Pacific Islander descent and use examples drawn from my involvement in formalized community groups, cultural events, and social functions. In doing so, I argue that the expression of Islander and Pacific Islander identity is entwined with ideas about 'race,' place, stereotypes, and behavior that highlight the dynamic ethnogenesis of this group.

T1  - The Gay Second Generation: Sexual Identity and Family Relations of Filipino and Latino Gay Men
AN  - 1520342905; 201413358
AB  - While studies have considered how race has reshaped how children of immigrants adapt to US life, studies have not thoroughly considered how sexual identity affects their assimilation. With a focus on familial incorporation, this study draws from the narratives of second-generation Filipino and Latino gay men to show that sexual identity deeply shapes the degree to which gay children of immigrants are able to secure social support and moral acceptance from their parents. These men employ strategies to maintain rapport with their families before and after coming out of the closet, a process I term moral management. While this study focuses on a unique population, the findings have greater implications for uncovering the mechanisms of intergenerational conflict and consensus among immigrant populations, as well as the dynamics of overcoming social prejudices within minority communities.

T1  - Individual Differences in Discrimination Expectations Moderate the Impact of Target Stereotypically Black Physical Features on Racism-Related Responses in Blacks
AN  - 1492600170; 201400198
AB  - Two experiments assess the extent that targets' stereotypically Black physical features and individual differences in perceiver discrimination expectations influence racism-related responses. In Experiment 1, a total of 115 Black college students read about an ambiguously racist workplace situation. Participants reported their hostile emotions and racism attributions. In Experiment 2, a total of 121 Black college students read about two White police officers who physically harm a Black male. Participants reported their experience of empathy for the Black target. In both experiments, stereotypically Black physical features of the Black target were experimentally manipulated, and individual differences in discrimination expectations were assessed. More stereotypically Black physical features elicited greater racism attributions, greater hostile emotions, and more empathy for the target; and in all cases, the impact was stronger for Blacks with low discrimination expectations relative to those with high discrimination expectations. When person-related variables are especially salient, the influence of situational factors is necessarily reduced. Specifically, our findings demonstrate the insensitivity to racism-related situational cues that may be most pervasive for Blacks with high discrimination expectations.

T1  - Religion, ethnicity and identity: former Soviet Christian immigrants in Israel
AN  - 1551000534; 201429081
AB  - The social construction of ethnic and religious identities of Christian immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) arriving in Israel under the Law of Return after 1990, and the role of churches in their social integration, are examined. As Israeli citizens actively involved in Christian churches, they challenge the Jewish character of the state, and the dynamics of their ethnic and religious identity should be understood in this unique context of reception. The analysis sheds light on the complex relationship between ethnic and religious identities and illustrates how different religious organizational configurations (Russian Orthodox and Greek churches) prompt immigrants to forge different patterns of identity along ethnic lines.

T1  - Gender-, race-, and income-based stereotype threat: the effects of multiple stigmatized aspects of identity on math performance and working memory function
AN  - 1680154090; 201514087
AB  - This study compared the relative impact of gender-, race-, and income-based stereotype threat and examined if individuals with multiple stigmatized aspects of identity experience a larger stereotype threat effect on math performance and working memory function than people with one stigmatized aspect of identity. Seventy-one college students of the stigmatized and privileged gender, race, and income-level completed math and working memory pre-tests. Then, participants heard a moderately explicit stereotype threat-inducing prime. Next, participants took math and working memory post-tests. Stereotype threat effects were found on math performance on the basis of race and income-level, but not on the basis of gender. Stereotype threat effects were found on working memory function on the basis of gender, race, and income-level. For both measures, the income-based effects were the strongest. Results also suggest the possibility of multiple minority stereotype threat effects on math performance and working memory. More specifically, individuals with three stigmatized aspects of identity experienced significantly larger stereotype threat effects than those with zero-, one-, or two-stigmatized aspects of identity.

T1  - Detroit's idle: the domestic sounds of labour's foreign landscape
AN  - 1448995177; 201342921
AB  - Black music is an ideo-aesthetic practice that highlights the making of myriad identity positions, including race, citizenship and class. Under globalisation and the mass commodification of US life, however, corporations have co-opted Black musics for various ends to manufacture alternative desires and realities to those of the musicians themselves, whose visions are better understood as 'freedom dreams'.1 This article examines one such abuse, in which Black music was used as both foil and concealment for an (enforcedly) idle working class in the majority Black city of Detroit. Through close analysis of two 2011 Chrysler Corporation commercials, the article demonstrates how the radical disarticulation of location, labour and race within popular culture has reconfigured Black labour into an ephemeral cultural influence, rather than a tradition of economic affluence. By dislocating the manual and cultural labours of Black Detroit from the scenery and products that it sells, Chrysler abandons the city that made it, opting instead to locate itself in a site of cultural and economic make-believe through the medium of a white male rap emcee.

T1  - Italian Jews: From Social Integration to the Construction of a New European Identity
AN  - 1559005905; 201431925
AB  - In this article I discuss the history of Italian Jews from the Emancipation to the racial laws of 1938 and their present-day attitudes to Judaism and the State of Israel. My aim is to suggest how the policy of social integration enabled Italian Jews to construct a new identity without losing their ancestral heritage. The example of Italian Jewry is relevant to understanding the growing need in today's European Union-now comprising 27 countries with different languages, cultures, and values-of revising the concept of national identity and of exploring ways of constructing a new European identity.

T1  - Indigeneity and Kenya's Nubians: seeking equality in difference or sameness?
AN  - 1531931536; 201423229
AB  - Recent studies of indigeneity in Africa have highlighted the problematic nature of the concept in a continent where it is difficult to determine which groups have temporal priority in a given location. These studies have suggested, with varying degrees of criticism, that indigeneity in Africa is a strategic identity deployed to attain a special status and associated benefits, often to remedy past harms. This article agrees that indigeneity is an act of positioning, but suggests that in the Kenyan context it can be deployed in another way as well, that is, as an act that seeks equal rather than special positioning within the dominant population. In this case indigeneity is not a special 'slot' but rather the norm. The article illustrates this by drawing on research with the Nubian community of Nairobi who seek to shed their ethnic stranger status and instead position themselves as indigenous to Nairobi in order to access the same quality of citizenship as that enjoyed by Kenya's '42 tribes'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bearing the burden of whiteness: the implications of racial self-identification for multiracial adolescents' school belonging and academic achievement
AN  - 1417525364; 201331850
AB  - Previous literature on racial self-identification among multiracials demonstrates that self-identification differs by context. Moreover, among multiracial adolescents, identity, usually measured in school, is correlated with achievement. In addition, a few studies have indicated that for half-white, half-minority adolescents, school achievement falls in between the achievements of their monoracial counterparts. Using the in-school and in-home components of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we examine the relationship between racial self-identification and school belonging and achievement. We find that among black/white and Asian/white adolescents, adolescents who self-identify as white are particularly disadvantaged in school, reporting lower grade point averages (GPA) than their multiracial counterparts. Our conclusions suggest that multiple contextual measures of self-identification better capture the relationship between racial identification and academic achievement among multiracial adolescents.

T1  - 'Muslim is the New Black': New Ethnicities and New Essentialisms in the Prison
AN  - 1728660755; 201534084
AB  - Drawing from a recent qualitative study of identity, ethnicity, and social relations in two English prisons, the authors reflect on Stuart Hall's formulation of a new ethnicities paradigm. Using a vignette case study and the comments of a range of prisoners, they consider how persistent patterns of racism are reproduced and challenged in the prison and beyond. British and penal historical and cultural contexts are provided to facilitate an empirically informed discussion of plural and evolving racisms, new ethnicities, and Islamophobia. An argument is presented that suggests a thinly theorized understanding of ethnicity is assuming the status of a falsely benign orthodoxy, one that shrouds the familiar and painful injuries of racism.

T1  - Family Debts, Personal Desires and Migratory Realities: Albanian Second-Generation Youth in Athens
AN  - 1364702593; 201323296
AB  - In recent decades, the concept of the "second generation" has become an important topic of research in migration studies. Scholars have drawn a distinction between the so-called "1.5 or 1.75 generation" -- children born in the country of origin but raised and educated in that of settlement -- and the "classic second generation" -- children born in the country of settlement (see Menjivar, 2002: 532; Christou, 2006: 831). Studies on "second generation" focus on the issues of integration and assimilation to the country of settlement. Integration and assimilation have been recently conceived as complex processes shaped by a range of factors. These factors may be structural and institutional, just as educational and labour market status, government policy, citizenship laws, and levels of discrimination and racism. They may also be less quantifiable, just as culture, ethnic or religious identity, gender, immigrant parents' social capital, region of settlement, the size and structure of pre-existing co-ethnic communities, and personal agency (Feliciano and Rumbaut, 2005; Portes and Zhou, 1993; Portes et al., 2005; Rassool, 1999; Thomson and Crul, 2007).

T1  - A Different Kind of Whiteness: Marking and Unmarking of Social Boundaries in the Construction of Hegemonic Ethnicity
AN  - 1364701515; 201323562
AB  - This article proposes a new theoretical approach to the analysis of hegemonic ethnicity through an examination of the construction of white ethnicity among Ashkenazim (Jews of European origin) in Israel. Contrary to the theory of symbolic ethnicity, I argue that "Ashkenaziness" in Israel is not an optional, voluntary identity; rather, it is constituted by employing narratives that continually establish cultural, color-based, and ethnic boundaries between Ashkenazim and Mizrahi Jews. In certain social and ideological circumstances, however, boundary marking is not enough to maintain a privileged status. From the narratives of Ashkenazi Jews-the Israeli version of whites-it emerges that not only do they demarcate social boundaries between themselves and other groups, thereby preserving the ethnic hierarchy, but they are constantly engaged in blurring or erasing these same boundaries, allowing Ashkenazim to remain a transparent, unmarked social category. This dual practice of marking and unmarking is a result of the tension between the Jewish-Zionist and Western-secular images of the state. While Israel's Jewish discourse supposedly negates intra-Jewish ethnic conflicts, the Western ideal identifies Ashkenazim with the state, thus solidifying their power and preserving their privileged status.

T1  - BLACK OPPOSITION TO WELFARE IN THE AGE OF OBAMA
AN  - 1512218570; 201408862
AB  - In this article, we examine black attitudes toward welfare as a function of racial-identity, internalized racism and affection toward Barack Obama. We argue that black feelings towards domestic policy from which blacks benefit (in this case, welfare) are augmented by the presence of an African-American president; blacks who subscribe to the notion of 'linked fate' will be more likely to support such policies; however, blacks who reject the notion of 'linked fate' and accept the philosophy of individualism will point to the existence of an Obama presidency as proof that such policies are extrinsic to black socioeconomic mobility and that the true hindrance is the lack of desire by other blacks to pursue avenues of upward mobility. Moreover, blacks who possess internalized racism are expected to reject progressive policies that impact a disproportionate number of blacks. Using 2008 American National Election Studies Time Series Data, we test for positive racial-identity and internalized racism in predicting attitudes toward welfare. Our findings support our expectations as the level of internalized racism, racial identity and affection toward President Obama proved to be significant in explaining attitudes toward welfare. However, ideology, party identification and socioeconomic failed to significantly explain opposition to welfare. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Linguistic Description Moderates the Evaluations of Counterstereotypical People
AN  - 1494749235; 201401928
AB  - The present research investigated linguistic description as a moderator of biased evaluations of counterstereotypical individuals. Members of an online participant pool (N = 237) indicated their liking for stereotypical and counterstereotypical individuals who were described using adjectives or behaviors. There was a significant interaction between target typicality and linguistic description: People liked counterstereotypical individuals more than stereotypical individuals when target individuals were described using adjectives. In contrast, they showed no bias or a negative bias against counterstereotypical individuals who were described using behaviors. This interaction effect generalized across gender targets (men/women) and sexuality targets (gay/straight), and it was partially mediated by subjective processing fluency. Implications for the backlash effect and prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From White Males to Black Females: Understanding the National Bodies of Ethiopia (1896-1936)
AN  - 1373426780; 201328776
AB  - This essay argues that the racial identities assigned to Ethiopia in the late 19th century and early 20th century were a direct result of the sexualized racial identities that were due to racist philosophies of colonialism. Teshale Tibebu's and Harold Marcus's essays on the national identity of Ethiopia and Lewis Gordon's philosophical views of the sexual nature of racial identities serve a foundation for the rationale behind Ethiopia's identity redefinition. Ethiopia, defeating Italy at Adwa, could not be seen as Black by many in the global community. Key contributions of this essay are how Ethiopians themselves defined their own nation and a discussion of how this identity was redefined in the discourse surrounding the global response to Italy's occupation in 1936. This new characterization allows us to move beyond traditional motivations of colonization and examine the racialized and gendered bodies of the colonized and colonizers in the context of modern Ethiopia.

T1  - Planning for a successful return home: Transnational habitus and education strategies among Japanese expatriate mothers in Los Angeles
AN  - 1315602566; 201307651
AB  - Based on ethnographic research of Japanese expatriate families in Los Angeles, this article explores how Japanese expatriate mothers, in dealing with globalization and transnational migration, develop transnational habitus and education strategies. These mothers attempt to assure their children's successful reintegration into the competitive Japanese education system that is increasingly concerned with raising globally oriented, cosmopolitan Japanese children. Drawing on a transnational perspective, this case study illustrates how the global economy increasingly offers chances to live abroad, which in turn offer opportunities for families to cultivate their children's academic proficiency, transnational competencies, and various cultural skills. Yet, this article also reveals a cost of such activities, namely the emotional burdens of the mothers, which derive from their increasing engagement in intensive mothering and identity management in a transnational social field. The findings suggest the importance of studying the intersections between globalization and women's construction of race, ethnicity, gender, and emotion by focusing on their embeddedness in multiple sociocultural contexts.

T1  - Violence and trauma as constitutive elements in Korean American racial identity formation: the 1992 L.A. riots/insurrection/saigu
AN  - 1373428357; 201328642
AB  - This paper proposes a new understanding of race as an artifact constructed from racist violence and the trauma it engenders. The paper applies Jeffrey Alexander's concept of 'cultural trauma', i.e. when 'members of a collectivity feel they have been subjected to a horrendous event that leaves indelible marks on their group consciousness', to the case of Korean immigrant merchants who were victims of violence during the 1992 L.A. riots/insurrection/saigu in Los Angeles, California, following the acquittal of four white police officers charged with violently assaulting a black motorist. Though the violence was contained to distinct neighbourhoods, the larger society experienced the terror because of the mass media. Over time this media-event led to the construction of a new identity rooted in violence and trauma. Through an examination of various texts, this paper argues that the Korean-American collective consciousness shifted discursively from an identity rooted in nationality to one incorporating race.

T1  - Quilombismo and the Afro-Brazilian Quest for Citizenship
AN  - 1373428119; 201328487
AB  - Between the radicalism of Black Brazilian movements of the 1980s, an aftermath of the negation and rejection of the myth of "racial democracy" that denies Brazilian subtle racism, the rise of re-Africanization sensibilities among Afro-Carnival groups, and the current ambivalent co-optation that has been packaged as "affirmative action" in the new millennium, a missing link to the many quests for Afro-Brazilianness lies in the (dis)locations that permeate the issues of identity, consciousness, and Africa-rootedness. Recent studies have remained invested in the polarity between the rigidity of "race" (one-drop rule) from the North American perspective and the fluidity of identity as professed by the South American miscegenation thesis. Regardless of the given schools of thought, or discourses, that have not resolved the oppressive sociopolitical realities on the ground, one must face the many levels of (dis)locations that define Afro-Brazilian identities. This essay draws upon the cultural productions of five Afro-Brazilian poets from various regions of Brazil, namely, Oliveira Silveira, Lepe Correia, Jamu Minka, Abelardo Rodrigues, and Carlos de Assumpcao. Beyond exposing the marginalized poets to a wider readership in English, the essay also engages the current debate in the shift from racial democracy to affirmative action in Brazil and the implications for continued racial tensions and contradictions in the Brazilian state.

T1  - 'Whitening' and the Changing American Racial Hierarchy
AN  - 1551000423; 201428969
AB  - As a result of the increasing number of biracials and multiracials, and White reconstructions of previously non-White skin colors, the Whitening of selected immigrants and especially their children appears to be proceeding. Although there are many studies on the racial identity of biracials, too little research exists on how Whites identify them and light-skinned monoracials, which of these they Whiten, how, and why. Enough is known to suggest that if current trends continue, our picture of the country's racial hierarchy has to be revised. While Whites will likely remain on top and poor African Americans and other Blacks at the bottom, what happens in the middle cannot now even be guessed at with any hope of accuracy. For that reason alone, empirical and policy-oriented research on White identification patterns is badly needed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - BRINGING THE DEMOS BACK IN: People's views on 'European identity'
AN  - 1551001849; 201428882
AB  - The creation of a European demos is often debated by referring to forms of ethnic or civic identities. The present article aims to expose the theoretical shortcomings of this dichotomous approach, which confines the complexity of Europe within a simplifying methodological nationalism. By relying on empirical data collected in four different European regions, the article points to the relevance of a functional or utilitarian rationale which European interviewees use to justify the existence of Europe. Although this rationale does not obliterate cultural and civic narrations of Europe, I would argue that it invites to reconsider the traditional role played by identities in the construction of political institutions. Accordingly, I believe that scholars should take more seriously the metaphor 'Europe as a laboratory' -- a convenient, but often empty metaphor. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mapping Race: The Discourse of Blackness in Rudolph Fisher's Walls of Jericho
AN  - 1417527359; 201332003
AB  - An important though under-examined novel of the Harlem Renaissance, Rudolph Fisher's The Walls of Jericho (1928) is conversant with its contemporary intellectual and social developments. These include the assault on the racist biology-culture correspondence that was commonplace in anthropology and other sciences, and the political and symbolic gestures toward Africa, like those of the Back to Africa movement. But the novel's poignancy stems from the fact that it portends critical developments in race theory by underscoring the manifold -- even fragmented -- nature of black social and historical experience. Despite its rejection of biological determinism and its ambivalence about Africa as a referent and a source of identity, Fisher's novel does not relinquish its commitment to black struggle and black political consciousness.

T1  - Intellectual Change in Black Studies: Evidence from a Cohort Analysis
AN  - 1417526856; 201332045
AB  - Forty years after emerging from student protest, Black Studies continues to wrestle with its identity. While Black Studies established itself in academia, the racial-ethnic diversity of faculty began to change and the racial-ethnic composition of Black Studies departments changed as well. This study uses Mannheim's theory of cohort driven social change to examine how Black Studies faculty members differ in their views of the field. The analyses suggest that differences in professional attitudes are related to demographic trends in the field: much of the disagreement over the field's distinctiveness from other disciplines stems from an older cohort of non-African American professors. Recent cohorts of Black and non-African American Black Studies professors appear to have similar views of the field. We suggest that this may be a response to the political activism that motivated the field at its inception, which may not be a formative experience for recently hired professors.

T1  - Englishness as class: A re-examination
AN  - 1494749543; 201401976
AB  - This paper considers the significance of class to English national identity. It takes one systematic exposition of the argument that Englishness has been traditionally and intimately bound up with class: George Schopflin's essay Englishness: citizenship, ethnicity and class, published in 2000. Schopflin thought that Englishness was distinctive in European terms by its class rather than its ethnic character and that this provided people with a very secure and very stable identity, though he did observe a more ethnicised form of identity emerging at the beginning of the new millennium. This is a strong definition of Englishness as class and the paper reassesses its claims in terms of recent research on identity. It argues for a more nuanced understanding of the role of class but suggests that the modus vivendi of English class relations still distinguishes its identity within Europe and the United Kingdom.

T1  - For the Love of Love: Neoliberal Governmentality, Neoliberal Melancholy, Critical Intersectionality, and the Advent of Solidarity with the Other Mormons
AN  - 1373426871; 201328651
AB  - This article performs critical intellectual labor for social and political change against neoliberalism in three ways. First, it explores and connects neoliberal governmentality and neoliberal melancholy, two anchor experiences in our twenty-first century political quotidian. Second, it engages in the sense making of Proposition 8 (a California voter initiative to ban same-sex marriage, which was narrowly passed in 2008) as a case study of religious organizations (the Mormon Church and their religious allies) and their complicity with neoliberal states to foster subjection and subjectivation through critical intersectionality that goes beyond the identity trinity of race, class, and gender. Finally, the article suggests two technologies as a new hand to outplay the excess of neoliberalism for the triumph of our common humanity: 1) mourning over the devastation brought about by neoliberalism and 2) loving our love for those with whom we usually do not form affinity connections, such as the other Mormons, those who are othered because of their departure from church orthodoxy.

T1  - The Price of 'Community' From Bisexual/Biracial Women's Perspectives
AN  - 1551001742; 201429119
AB  - When the words 'identity' or 'community' are evoked, a homogenizing process forms for the sake of community coherence. This article is based upon interviews with nine bisexual and mixed race participants about their conceptualization of identity-based communities. All participants expressed discontent with the 'established' gay and lesbian community for being monolithically White in racial composition and also biphobic. More than one half of the participants had been involved in queer Asian American women's organizations, within which they felt the least conflict and the most inclusion. The ideals of identity-based organizations have only sporadically manifested themselves for the bisexual-biracial women who are otherwise marginalized, silenced or excluded. Because their diverse needs and identities are not represented within these organizations, many of the participants felt they gave more than they received. Finding that communities based upon narrow identity clusters were not ideal, the participants created diverse communities based upon their expanded interests and identities. These bisexual-biracial women have revolutionized their personal concepts of community as they integrated the ideals of identity politics yet moved to include individuals who share similar progressive politics, responsibility and acceptance.

T1  - Perceived Ethnic Discrimination and Social Exclusion: Newcomer Immigrant Children in Canada
AN  - 1347780758; 201318857
AB  - This article examines relationships between perceived ethnic discrimination, social exclusion, psychosocial functioning, and academic performance among newcomer immigrant children from the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, and the Philippines using a subsample from the New Canadian Children and Youth Study of children aged 11-13 years (1,053) living in Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and the Prairies. Bivariate analysis showed that 25% of children reported being treated unfairly by peers and 14% by teachers because of who they are. Regression analyses revealed that perceived ethnic discrimination by peers and teachers was negatively related to children's sense of social competence in peer relationships. Children's self-esteem and sense of academic competence were negatively related to perceived discrimination by teachers. One in 5 children reported feeling like an outsider, with boys revealing higher levels of psychological isolation than girls. More than 1 in 10 were socially isolated and reported never participating in organized activities. This may reflect economic exclusion, as over one third of respondents belonged to families living below the Canadian Income Adequacy Measure. Psychological isolation, social isolation, and economic exclusion were significant predictors of children's sense of academic competence and actual academic grades. Variations exist across age, sex, ethnicity, family structure, parental education, region of settlement, and length of time since arrival in Canada. [Copyright American Psychological Association]

T1  - Soviet "Blacks" and Place Making in Leningrad and Moscow
AN  - 1283644194; 201303443
AB  - Movement from the USSR's margins to Leningrad and Moscow, among groups ranging from traders to professionals, intensified in the late Soviet period. Using oral histories, Jeff Sahadeo analyzes the migration and place-making experiences of migrants from Central Asia, the Caucasus, and the Asian RSFSR, all of whom were often referred to then as well as now by the Slavic host population as "Blacks." Sahadeo argues that the "two capitals," despite being closed cities, became critical to advancement strategies for citizens unionwide, inextricably binding Soviet periphery and center. Sahadeo explores how race emerged as an important factor in place making but argues that this can only be understood through its interplay with class, gender, professional status, and other categories of identity. Soviet "Blacks" externalized experiences of difference as they sought incorporation into host societies while maintaining links between their adopted and native homes. Place-making strategies led them to see Leningrad and Moscow, not as Russian-dominated cities, but as modern spaces of Soviet progress. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Nation Dispossessed: The Tea Party Movement and Race
AN  - 1221409732; 201245140
AB  - This analysis combines both qualitative information and quantitative data. The author reviewed numerous first person reports of Tea Party rallies, conferences and meetings from every corner of the country, and read most of the movement's own literature. The Tea Parties are described as a unique movement appearing at a specific historical moment. The movement encompasses constituent national networks, core members and more loosely aligned supporters. Its supporters are overwhelmingly white and middle class. Matters of race and national identity motivate many Tea Partiers as well as a sense of dispossession from their place of privilege in the racial order. This analysis takes at face value the movement's dress, symbols and invocation of the constitution, as well as its claims to embody the aspirations of a narrow body of 'real Americans'. By making an exclusionary claim on the nation's founding moments, they actually set themselves apart from other Americans. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]

T1  - (Re)framing identity claims: European and state institutions as opportunity windows for group reinforcement
AN  - 1125222542; 201240390
AB  - How do we account for the reinforcement of identity particularisms despite transnational integration? This paper addresses the question by comparing two ethnolinguistic groups, Silesians and Kashubs in Poland. It is argued that in order to obtain state protection and tools to develop and survive, ethnic entrepreneurs adjust to institutions and discourses. Census politics, state laws' elaboration, transnational institutions represent openings to which groups adjust by reframing identity claims. In doing so, they re-imagine and reinforce their communities. Following Rogers Brubaker, group-making is presented as an eventful process where ethnic elites invest identity categories with groupness by taking advantage of opportunity windows at hand. Further, tracing changing political opportunities, strategic adjustments and groups' boomerang effect bid, the paper embeds identity groups within the social movement literature.

T1  - Using Illness Narratives to Explore African American Perspectives of Racial Discrimination in Health Care
AN  - 1125220576; 201240492
AB  - Explanations for race-based disparities in health and health care abound, yet the mechanisms through which individuals reach determinations of discrimination remains poorly understood. This study collected and analyzed first-person narratives from 12 African American adults regarding their interactions with the health care system to elucidate possible sources of racism and discrimination while seeking medical care. Our analysis revealed that participants reached conclusions of perceived discrimination and differential treatment through their comparative observations and intuitive judgments. In such instances, they found it necessary to develop strategies to overcome the perceived lack of attention they received. Additionally, many participants expressed a considerable difference in the quality of interpersonal interactions between themselves and some of their health care providers, compared to interactions their providers had with patients from groups that are not racially underrepresented. In such instances, participants were compelled to develop strategies to overcome what they perceived to be a lack of attention. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Opening the Cabaret America Allegory: Hemispheric Politics, Performance, and Utopia in Flying Down to Rio
AN  - 1417526858; 201333379
AB  - This essay examines the Carioca song-and-dance scene that lies at the narrative center of the 1933 film Flying Down to Rio in light of current theories of identity performance and performativity. Produced by RKO at a time when the studio became the meeting point of U.S. political and industrial interests, Flying represents a seminal moment in the cinematic representation of intercultural relations in the Americas. Its use of music and dance to articulate an inter-American utopia based on spectacle and entertainment ushered in the depiction of Latin American identity as an always evolving performance. Flying established a template for the representation of hemispheric relations that has been followed by numerous films produced not only in Hollywood but also in Latin America. From its position at the onset of the Good Neighbor policy, the scene becomes a historic record of the pivotal role that the construction of Latino and Latin American identities occupies in the articulation of racialist discourses in the United States.

T1  - Spectres of Jordan
AN  - 1283642915; 201303242
AB  - Despite retiring from the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2003, the iconic basketball player Michael Jordan continues to inform popular understandings of race and racial difference. Jordan could thus be considered a raced spectre (Derrida 1994): a fantastically racialized figure derived from, and cast in the mould of, the contingencies of an earlier moment in American history, who nonetheless informs the racial politics and experience of the present. In examining Jordan's enduring influence on contemporary America's implicitly raced neoliberal formation, this discussion involves: a re-envisioning of the raced neoliberal politics implicit within, and mobilized by, Jordan's commodified identity; an illustration of how the institutionalization of racial logics derived from Jordan's idealized raced subjectivity have come to inform the racially regressive management and governance of the NBA; an exhumation of how the very form of Jordan's enduring phantasm has been accommodated to shifting, and increasingly interwoven, commercial and racial forces; and an examination of the contemporaneous manifestations and influences of the Jordan spectre.

T1  - Cape Verdean identity in a land of Black and White
AN  - 1023026836; 201223840
AB  - Cape Verde is an island group off the African coast with a history of slavery. Its residents having both European and African ancestors, they consider themselves a mixed-race people. Residents of the United States, however, observe the one-drop rule: anyone with a perceptible trace of African blood is defined as Black. This difference motivates us to ask: how do Cape Verdean Americans answer questions about their racial identity? Strict assimilationists predict that, as they adapt to their new home, Cape Verdeans will identify less as mixed-race than as White or Black. Others suggest that the quality of race relations at the time immigrants arrive affects their identity. We test these ideas using data from the 2000 US Census and the American Community Survey. Our multivariate analysis shows that some, but not all, forms of assimilation increase the odds of identifying as Black. The odds of identifying as White, on the other hand, have little to do with assimilation. The timing of arrival also has a significant effect on racial identity, with Black gaining popularity among recent immigrants. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Mapping census data for difference: Towards the heterogeneous geographies of Arab American communities of the New York metropolitan area
AN  - 1283638045; 201303418
AB  - This article examines how 2000 US census statistics serve to reproduce Arab Americans as a social body with specific political possibilities. Its first goal is to show how the conventionally used census data acts as a source of statistical and, furthermore, social and political marginalization by rendering Arab Americans, who poorly fit into its racial classification, either invisible or lacking in internal heterogeneity. The result is absent viable political identity for Arab Americans, general ignorance of their experiences in the United States, and negative stereotyping. Because in the post-9/11 United States, Arab American advocacy groups have turned to statistics, among other means, to forge positive visibility, our second goal is to suggest innovative and practical ways to make a more informed use of the existing census statistics despite that their categorical and numerical inconsistencies relative to Arab American identities. Instead of a quantitative analysis, we thus offer a feminist inspired method of "mapping for difference" three census datasets-Arabic language spoken at home, place of birth in an Arab nation, and Arab ancestry, which involves applying a primarily qualitative analysis to these variables while contextualizing them by immigration history. Our result is a set of heterogeneous Arab American geographies, not intended for better quantitative description but serving to counter practices of marginalization by broadening public imagination and knowledge about this diverse community. Throughout, we suggest that while the designation Arab American maybe practically and politically useful, the recognition of the heterogeneity of Arab community along multiple dimensions of difference must be built into the methods of analysis. We demonstrate our major points with selected empirical maps from our larger research project on the census-based geographies of Arab Americans in the New York metropolitan area, one of the largest and most understudied communities in North America.

T1  - Race and reflexivity
AN  - 1283640754; 201303311
AB  - It is widely recognized that our understanding of the racial order will remain forever unsatisfactory so long as we fail to turn our analytic gaze back upon ourselves, the analysts of racial domination, and inquire critically into the hidden presuppositions that shape our thought. However, for reflexivity to be employed widely in the interest of scientific truth, analysts must acknowledge that reflexive thinking entails much more than observing how one's social position (racial identity or class background, for example) affects one's scientific analyses. In this paper, we deepen the meaning of scholarly reflexivity, discussing how it can be directed at three levels of hidden presuppositions: the social, the disciplinary, and the scholastic.

T1  - Requiring Respect: Searching for Non-Racialism in Post-Apartheid South Africa
AN  - 1221409557; 201244048
AB  - Non-racialism is a central tenet of the post-apartheid nation-building project located at the heart of the South African Constitution. However, race remains a core discourse in the political and popular lexicon, acting as a key marker through which individual and collective identities, of selves and others, are constructed. Utilising focus group data from across South Africa, this article contends that the failure to clearly define the Constitution's founding tenet of 'non-racialism' is reflected in citizens' uncertain engagements with the contested terrain of race, identity and belonging in post-apartheid South Africa. Layered onto this concern is a sense that citizens are concerned with the realisation of the conditions for self-respect and reciprocal relations of respect as the precursor to a more equitable society.

T1  - Racial Identity and Racial Treatment of Mexican Americans
AN  - 1081865463; 201235336
AB  - How racial barriers play in the experiences of Mexican Americans has been hotly debated. Some consider Mexican Americans similar to European Americans of a century ago that arrived in the United States with modest backgrounds but were eventually able to participate fully in society. In contrast, others argue that Mexican Americans have been racialized throughout U.S. history, and this limits their participation in society. The evidence of persistent educational disadvantages across generations and frequent reports of discrimination and stereotyping supports the racialization argument. In this paper, we explore the ways in which race plays a role in the lives of Mexican Americans by examining how education, racial characteristics, social interactions, relate to racial outcomes. We use the Mexican American Study Project, a unique data set based on a 1965 survey of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio combined with surveys of the same respondents and their adult children in 2000, thereby creating a longitudinal and intergenerational data set. First, we found that darker Mexican Americans, therefore appearing more stereotypically Mexican, report more experiences of discrimination. Second, darker men report much more discrimination than lighter men and than women overall. Third, more educated Mexican Americans experience more stereotyping and discrimination than their less educated counterparts, which is partly due to their greater contact with whites. Lastly, having greater contact with whites leads to experiencing more stereotyping and discrimination. Our results are indicative of the ways in which Mexican Americans are racialized in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The ethnic Russian population has experienced important demographic changes in the past twenty years, including declining birthrates and high mortality rates. The migration to Russia of ethnic Russians from the countries of the near abroad did not fully compensate for this demographic decline. For the future health of Russian society it will be imperative to depoliticize ethnicity in favor of a focus on the human individual with a multi-layered identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "It Ain't All as Bad as it May Seem": Young Black Lesbians' Responses to Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1266144128; 201300449
AB  - This article explores the ways in which young, Black lesbians manage their sexual minority identity when experiencing sexual prejudice. Fourteen Black lesbians between the ages of 16 and 24 participated in semistructured interviews. Instances of sexual prejudice and the young women's responses were thematically analyzed using open and axial qualitative coding techniques. Results indicated that participants experienced sexual prejudice frequently and even within the lesbian community. Responses to sexual prejudice included: cognitive reframing of heterosexist messages, passing, gaining support from self-created gay families, and fighting back (physically and verbally) in the event of isolated instances of sexual prejudice. Analysis focuses on how gender identity relates to experiences of sexual prejudice and identity management strategies. Findings suggest that there are parallels between the management strategies of these women and young, Black gay and bisexual males and between these women and Black women who are coping with sexism and racism.

AB  - Taylor contends that instead of seeking integration, Hispanics, Asians, and blacks are growing more racially conscious in sharp contrast to the decline of racial consciousness amongst whites. Chief among these is the loss of former Mexican territory to the United States and American enforcement on the U.S.-Mexican border. Because of immigration patterns over the last forty years, Hispanics have overtaken blacks as America's biggest minority, at over 16 percent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discrimination and Help-Seeking: Use of Professional Services and Informal Support Among African Americans, Black Caribbeans, and Non-Hispanic Whites with a Mental Disorder
AN  - 1081862910; 201235406
AB  - This study used data from the National Survey of American Life to investigate the use of professional services and informal support among African Americans, black Caribbeans, and non-Hispanic whites. Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the association of race and perceived discrimination with the use of professional services only, informal support only, both professional services and informal support, or no help at all. Fifty-one percent of the sample used both professional services and informal support, 16% relied on professional services only, 20% used informal support only, and 13% did not seek help. Before controlling for other factors, African Americans and black Caribbeans were significantly less likely to receive either professional or informal help compared with whites. When everyday racial discrimination was included, racial differences in not seeking help were no longer significant. Household income also influenced the relationship between race and help-seeking. Other factors significantly associated with help-seeking include age, gender, education, employment status, insurance coverage, type and severity of disorder, and subjective closeness to family and friends. The association of these factors and implication of the findings for future research and mental health service delivery will be discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "What Happened to All the Protests?" Black Megachurches' Responses to Racism in a Colorblind Era
AN  - 1364700023; 201323305
AB  - Before and during the Civil Rights era, mass protests were very effective in bringing attention to blatant racial inequalities. How do black churches address racism that seemingly is not there in a post-Civil Rights colorblind era? A growing trend amongst black churchgoers in the post-Civil Rights period is that of megachurches and neo-Pentecostalism. While both black megachurches and neo-Pentecostal churches tend to preach a theology of self-empowerment, this is just one of a range of theologies that may be preached in these churches. In a content analysis of the 2008 Easter sermons of three neo-Pentecostal megachurches in Maryland, I address how the type of theology preached in black megachurches can correspond with the way a collective racial identity is constructed, which could therefore influence how racism is resisted.

T1  - Introduction: Fluidity and Friction in Talent Migration
AN  - 896180378; 201120204
AB  - In this introduction to the special issue of JEMS on The Cultural Politics of Talent Migration in Asia, we note the movement in the academic literature from a narrow focus on the economic rationalities and corporate logics of transnational mobility among professional, managerial and entrepreneurial elites, to a greater interest in these elite transnational subjects as embodied bearers of culture, ethnicity, class and gender. We draw out two key themes that inform the arguments advanced by the papers in this special issue. First, instead of hyper-fluid global nomads who move effortlessly across frictionless global space, the papers show that moving and belonging are not simply motivated by economic logic but are folded into broader social, cultural and political considerations and conditioned by the power geometries of race, nationality and gender. Second, different groups of talent migrants are attracted to and positioned differently in specific spaces of encounter within cities, generating a politics of identity that influences everyday life. Taken together, these two themes highlight the need to avoid artificially bifurcating the lives of talent migrants into the economic and social/cultural spheres, and instead to argue for interweaving them within the same frame in understanding the mobility of the highly skilled.

AN  - 925712377; 201204213
AB  - Parting from existing work on music and identity, this essay explores the ways that black masculinity and material culture structure Don Omar's claims of Latino unity. I use the performance of Don Omar to understand how black pride and capital become markers of latinidad. I analyze the persona of Don Omar via Afro Puerto Rican identity as compared to the development of the Italian gangster and the black gangsta and nigga in hip hop culture. I also examine the complex ways Afro-Puerto Rican and African-American men negotiate gendered subordination and ethnic pride through reggaeton. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Performing Blackness in a South African HIV/AIDS Choir
AN  - 887498891; 201118163
AB  - The Siphithemba Choir, an HIV/AIDS support group at the McCord Mission Hospital in Durban, South Africa, uses songs that conflate "Africa" and "Black Race" (abantu abamnyama) or "Black Nation" (Umnyama yezwe) to perform their experience of HIV/AIDS, thus signaling global ethnic/racial consciousness in the context of the HIV/AIDS discourse. This paper argues that the musical referencing of race and ethnicity by this group of HIV-positive South Africans could be explained as a function of related factors: the nature of the AIDS virus, the history and lingering effects of apartheid, the continuing interracial acrimony in the post-apartheid environment, and the global politics of AIDS. A combination of these factors has inevitably impacted how HIV/AIDS is perceived and interpreted through the lens of race. Hence the Siphithemba Choir's musical performance is analyzed in this paper as an expressive articulation of an African and Black experience of AIDS, and a performance of Black identity in the context of the global AIDS pandemic.

T1  - Unpacking Multiculturalism in the Classroom: Using Current Events to Explore the Politics of Difference
AN  - 1429627393; 201335723
AB  - The content of this paper stems from an interactive workshop conducted by its authors at the 2nd Joint Annual Conference of the Association for Canadian Studies and the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association in the fall of 2011. As the conference theme was "Revisiting 40 Years of Multicultural Policy in Canada," the goal of the workshop was to bridge the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating how to bring multiculturalism into the classroom through discussion of current events documented in the media; despite the recognition of multiculturalism as the foundation of national identity in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the greatest challenge for teachers remains how to incorporate the concept into their teaching practice. In examining how multiculturalism has evolved to become more inclusive since its implementation as federal policy-having been broadened from focusing only on race and ethnicity to a range of human differences, all of which have political and pedagogical ramifications in the classroom and beyond-participants in the workshop were encouraged to question how the privileges enjoyed by groups that represent the norm in society factored into recent Canadian and American news events. Six recent media reports were selected in order to facilitate a discussion that allowed for the "unpacking" of a particular component of identity, in relation to either race, gender, class, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, or religion.

T1  - Surveillant staring: Race and the everyday surveillance of South Asian women after 9/11
AN  - 925713033; 201204117
AB  - This article explores young South Asian women's accounts of being subject to surveillance within a post-September 11th United States political framework, using a combination of surveillance studies and a postcolonial studies attention to practices of racialization and belonging. It looks at non-technological practices of person-to-person surveillance of South Asian women by non-authoritative white Americans. The article discusses young women's accounts of feeling 'stared at' by other Americans in public space, and examines how the effects of this surveillance relates to young women's identities as South Asians in America. The article argues that citizen surveillance practices have racialized outcomes for young women of South Asian descent that sometimes consolidates a South Asian racial subjectivity within the US. The fieldwork also uncovers an extension of arguments about racialized surveillance to consider cultural bodily practices and clothing artifacts alongside racial identity.

T1  - Exploring Identity Negotiations: An Analysis of Intercultural Japanese-U.S. American Families Living in the United States
AN  - 1364701180; 201323497
AB  - This study examines identity negotiations of intercultural Japanese-U.S. American families particularly in terms of a) how dominant ideologies and societal structures relate to the formation and negotiation of intercultural married couples' identities, and b) how they negotiate the relational, family, and cultural identities in their relationship. Both interpretive and critical perspectives are utilized to uncover the complex nature of identity negotiations. Interviews with intercultural families reveal that their identity locations are negotiated from historical contexts and gender and racial ideologies. Ambivalence, contradictions, dialectical tensions, and the intersectionality of their identities are often mentioned in the interviews. Particularly in talking about their childrearing process, the parents negotiate multiple identities and manage dialectical tensions of their children's possible future identities. In general, the results show that intercultural families created a unique and secure space to navigate the social, economic, and political climates in the United States and Japan.

T1  - On an Island without Sun: Coping Strategies of Sikhs in Ireland
AN  - 1081863625; 201235267
AB  - This paper discusses 12 coping strategies -- tools that Sikh immigrants and their descendants have appropriated to make sense of and engage with their new surroundings in Ireland: (1) keeping tradition alive; (2) improvisation; (3) erasing markers of difference; (4) camouflage; (5) being smart, being tough; (6) being cool; (7) downplaying racism; (8) living with India; (9) crossing over, sharing experience; (10) becoming Asian; (11) becoming black; and (12) pluralist theology. These categories emerged through an engagement with Chicago School thinking from the first half of the twentieth century on modes by which immigrant communities adapt to their new surroundings; through a dialogical, hermeneutic process of reading and reflecting on the interview material; and through reflections on our positions as immigrant, racialised subjects. The mode of presentation is polyvocal -- a patchwork quilt of stories and images -- and the 'Sikh identity' that emerges in the text is plural. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The making and representation of Muslim identity in Britain: conversations with British Muslim 'elites'
AN  - 835111447; 201100436
AB  - The common nomenclature of ethnicity, race and colour has been found wanting in theorizing and dealing with the Muslim presence in Britain. This study of 24 prominent British Muslims - including political, policy and academic/intellectual 'elite' - explores the making and representation of Muslim identity in Britain. We explore this through three considerations: Muslimness as a 'master status'; leadership and representation in relation to British Muslims; and the public performance of Muslimness during 'key moments'.

T1  - Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and American Sporting Oppression: Examining Black and Gay Male Athletes
AN  - 758124674; 201056858
AB  - This article examines the influence of the racial categories of White and Black and the sexual categories of gay and straight on sporting American men. The effect of the intersection of these cultural categories is discussed by investigating the exclusion of athletes who are both Black and gay, as well as highlighting the culturally perceived differences of (straight) Black and (White) gay men. However, the analysis accounts for more than just difference, examining the commonalities of oppression between these discrete identity groups. We use the research on Black athletes to call for further empirical study on gay athletes. It is argued that critical race theory and intersectionality offer complex and nuanced understandings of these oppressions, which, when theorizing is left solely to the realm of poststructuralism, can otherwise be missed.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: Alternative Accounts and Underlying Processes
AN  - 764417429; 201064651
AB  - Although intergroup contact is one of the most prominent interventions to reduce prejudice, the generalization of contact effects is still a contentious issue. This research further examined the rarely studied secondary transfer effect (STE; Pettigrew, 2009), by which contact with a primary outgroup reduces prejudice toward secondary groups that are not directly involved in the contact. Across 3 cross-sectional studies conducted in Cyprus (N = 1,653), Northern Ireland (N = 1,973), and Texas (N = 275) and 1 longitudinal study conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 411), the present research sought to systematically rule out alternative accounts of the STE and to investigate 2 potential mediating mechanisms (ingroup reappraisal and attitude generalization). Results indicated that, consistent with the STE, contact with a primary outgroup predicts attitudes toward secondary outgroups, over and above contact with the secondary outgroup, socially desirable responding, and prior attitudes. Mediation analyses found strong evidence for attitude generalization but only limited evidence for ingroup reappraisal as an underlying process. Two out of 3 tests of a reverse model, where contact with the secondary outgroup predicts attitudes toward the primary outgroup, provide further evidence for an indirect effect through attitude generalization. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are identified. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Narratives of power: historical mythologies in contemporary Quebec and Canada
AN  - 754042730; 201053267
AB  - The official narratives that Canada tells itself about its history and identity facilitate the contemporary exercise of power, determining who is to be regarded as fully belonging and who is alien. While race is excised from these national narratives, it has in fact been central to the formation of Canadian nationhood. The image of the respectable, peaceful, multiculturalism-loving Canadian citizen, descendant of the two founding nations, France and Britain, goes hand in hand with its opposites: the Indigenous 'Indian', the Black, the immigrant newcomer and the refugee. This article examines the historical and contemporary variants of these images and the narratives constructed around them, arguing that Canada's history of colonial violence, slavery and racism has been marginalised through their circulation, and that their continued invocation in public debates on crime, terrorism and immigration is a crucial factor in the perpetuation of racial exclusion. The particular ways in which Quebec has conceived its relationship to English Canada add an interesting dimension to this discussion: in the 1960s, Quebecers saw in the political struggles of Africans and African Americans a metaphor for their own identity. But Quebec's own version of a founding national narrative is a tale of innocence and victimhood that conveniently omits the colonisation of Indigenous peoples, the practice of slavery and racial exclusion.

T1  - The Bosnian police, multi-ethnic democracy, and the race of 'European civilization'
AN  - 743048831; 201031787
AB  - In many social science accounts of the role of law enforcement organizations in relation to race and racism, police are positioned as the agents of racialization projects, directly or indirectly carrying out the state's work of demarcating insiders from outsiders along racial or ethnic lines. This paper will argue that in post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina the Bosnian police themselves have been the targets of a massive racialization project - one undertaken by police reformers from the international community. Furthermore, by entering the fray with Anglo-American paradigms of ethnicity and identity, and by imposing reforms governed by such paradigms, they only differently 'ethnicized' the Bosnian police rather than helping them to heal extant divisions. In turn, these imposed solutions trapped internationals and Bosnians alike in a situation in which the presence or absence of appropriate ethnic demographics became, for too long, one of the main proxy measures for democratic policing practice.

T1  - Race, Gender, and the Black Women's Standpoint
AN  - 743043195; 201026549
AB  - Hill Collins (1997, 1998, 2000) argues that because of their position within the intersecting hierarchies of race, gender, and class, black women as a group possess a 'unique angle of vision' on the social world. Rooted in the everyday experiences of black women, the 'black women's standpoint' is marked by an intersectional understanding of oppression and a 'legacy of struggle' against such oppression. In this article, I employ quantitative analyses of data from the National Survey of Black Americans (1992) and the National Black Feminist Study (2004-2005) to investigate the black women's standpoint. I ask: 'Do black women as a group tend toward the black women's standpoint that Hill Collins describes?' and 'Do black women embrace this perspective more than black men?' Results from numerous ^j2 and logistic regression analyses suggest that, within the black community, gender is not a significant predictor of the standpoint that Hill Collins describes, with black men and black women being equally lik.

AN  - 60361509; 201017480
AB  - In this final and concluding article, I focus on three broad and interwoven themes that cut across various articles in this issue. While these themes partially overlap with those highlighted in the introduction, it is their insinuation into policy discourses and actual formulations that informs their selection. These policy-oriented themes are language, immigrant integration, and the defiance of common sense; racialization, identity formation and second-generation educational achievement; and transnationalism and enforcement policies and immigrant responses. I end with a brief note on how academic research, and researchers themselves, can help further more fruitful and informed public policies. Adapted from the source document.
