T1  - Does Respect Foster Tolerance? (Re)analyzing and Synthesizing Data From a Large Research Project Using Meta-Analytic Techniques
AN  - 2666836775
AB  - Our own prior research has demonstrated that respect for disapproved others predicts and might foster tolerance toward them. This means that without giving up their disapproval of others’ way of life, people can tolerate others when they respect them as equals (outgroup respect–tolerance hypothesis). Still, there was considerable variation in the study features. Moreover, the studies are part of a larger research project that affords many additional tests of our hypothesis. To achieve integration along with a more robust understanding of the relation between respect and tolerance, we (re)analyzed all existing data from this project, and we synthesized the results with the help of meta-analytic techniques. The average standardized regression coefficient, which describes the relationship between respect and tolerance, was 0.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.16, 0.34]). In addition to this overall confirmation of our hypothesis, the size of this coefficient varied with a number of variables. It was larger for numerical majorities than for minorities, smaller for high-status than for low-status groups, and larger for religious than for life-style groups. These findings should inspire further theory development and spur growth in the social-psychological literature on tolerance.

T1  - The Politics of a National Identity Survey: Polishness, Whiteness, and Racial Exclusion
AN  - 2601850919
AB  - This article analyses a popular survey on national identity in Poland. However, the analysis of the survey is a pretext to remind one of the limitations of crude quantitative methods and to look at the Polish national identity itself. The article shows that the survey questions are far from unambiguous, and respondents might attribute different meanings to them. The survey does not “measure” national identity existing in the world, rather it serves to maintain the hegemonic concept of Polishness. It diminishes the significance of Catholicism and the perceived biological dimension of Polishness. It ignores public sentiment linking Whiteness and Polishness, contributing to maintaining the dominant image of Polishness as free of racism. Under the guise of objective research, the survey is one of the elements sustaining the image of a relatively open and inclusive Polishness. Referring to my own qualitative research and recent literature on the topic, I argue that Polish identity must be seen in terms of selective racism without racism—that is, it is an identity based on racial premises but which at the same time neglects its racial character.

T1  - Law and the construction of Jewish difference
AN  - 2531322310
AB  - Despite the significance of the figure of ‘the Jew’ as Other in the Western imagination and the persistence of prejudice against Jews, there have been few studies of contemporary Jews as subjects of prejudice in liberal secular law and legal discourse. This article draws attention to continuing Jewish vulnerability and argues that a focus on colonial encounters and phenotype in understanding processes of legal exclusion based on religion and race cannot fully account for the persistence of anti‐Jewish prejudice and its resonance in law and legal discourse. Through an analysis of contemporary case law from three different countries, I show how narratives of Christian superiority, veiled behind commitments to secular neutrality, and racializing discourse resonate in legal encounters with Jewishness. I highlight parallels with other minority groups, in particular Muslims, and consider the usefulness of antisemitism as an analytical lens to capture the ambivalent dynamics of Jewish inclusion and exclusion.

T1  - Authoritarian Personality and Gender Differences in Gun Control Attitudes
AN  - 2266702839
AB  - This article investigates the gender gap in gun control attitudes, in which women are more likely to support gun control than men. Women are less likely than men to own a gun and to see owning guns as a means of self-protection. Using the 2012 American National Election Study Data, this article tests authoritarianism, which includes the desire for security and a disposition toward higher levels of perceived threat, as an explanation for the gap. The results indicate that authoritarian women are more likely than authoritarian men to support gun control. In fact, authoritarianism appears to have the opposite effect on men and women's gun control attitudes. Authoritarianism is associated with higher levels of support for gun control among women and lower levels of support among men.

T1  - Tracking Ignorance: Examining Changes in Immigrant Population Innumeracy in the United States from 2005 to 2013
AN  - 2300097911
AB  - Citizens' tendency to overestimate the size of immigrant populations has been the subject of several studies over the past three decades. While we have learned a great deal about the extent, causes, and potential consequences of this population innumeracy, our understanding remains static. The current letter offers the first longitudinal consideration of immigrant population size misperceptions with an analysis across a nine-year span in the U.S. This study considers: 1) whether misperceptions have changed over time; 2) how these changes compare to the growth of the actual foreign-born population size; and 3) whether these changes are related to demographic and ideological factors. Results indicate that misperceptions have grown rapidly in the U.S, far outpacing the modest, actual increases across the period. Pooled cross-sectional analyses indicate that demographic factors do not explain the growth in misperceptions. However, the overestimates of politically conservative Americans have grown increasingly extreme over time.

T1  - Contact theory in the workplace: The case of Jewish–Arab contact in Israel
AN  - 2187744612
AB  - Contact theory is a fundamental theory in social psychology, suggesting that contact between antagonistic groups can reduce prejudice and stereotypes. The current study applies former studies in evaluating a specific case of the connection between contact and attitudes toward minorities in work contexts. A survey was conducted using 873 Israeli Jews in order to assess their attitudes toward the Arab population in Israel and Arabs' work characteristics. The results indicated that the connection between intergroup contact and attitudes is complex. On the one hand, workplace contact between Israeli Jews and Arabs was significantly correlated with the willingness to meet Arabs in and outside the workplace and to perceive Arabs in a less threatening way. However, contact during work was not significantly correlated with the participants' general attitude toward the Arab population. In addition, contact during work was not found to be significantly correlated with the participants' perceptions about Arabs' personality traits or work characteristics. The results of this study also suggest that attitudes toward Arabs' work characteristics have a strong connection to other dimensions of attitudes toward Arabs, even more than the impact of contact during work.

T1  - Japanese Attitudes Toward China and the United States: A Sociological Analysis
AN  - 2275917657
AB  - As China and the United States have a great impact on Japan, Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States have been the focus of debate. This study uses nationally representative longitudinal data from Japan to investigate how the economic and political threats are relevant to Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Empirical analyses find that: first, socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with individuals' attitudes toward the United States but not China. Second, individuals' perceptions of Japan's economic situation influence their attitudes toward China and the United States; that is, an optimistic assessment of Japan's economy increases the Japanese people's positive attitudes toward both China and the United States. Finally, the political threats have contrasting effects on Japanese attitudes toward China and the United States. Concerns over political threats increase Japan's favorable attitudes toward the United States while deteriorating the positive attitudes toward China.

T1  - Judging scandal: Standards or bias in politics
AN  - 2190352900
AB  - As the number of political scandals rises, we examined the circumstances that might influence how a politician would be judged as a result of a scandal. Specifically, we hypothesized that ingroup bias theory and shifting standards theory would produce different patterns of judgements. In two studies, we found support for the ingroup bias theory, such that participants rated the fictitious politician's public approval and perceived character as higher if the politician was a member of their own political party (i.e. their ingroup) than if the politician was a member of the another political party (i.e. their outgroup). These results may explain, in part, why people may judge politicians involved in scandal more or less harshly depending on whether they are an ingroup member or outgroup member.

T1  - Political Culture in the Islamic World: The Socioeconomic Roots of the Islamic Leviathan
AN  - 2140079295
AB  - In this paper, the author explores how development affects public opinions on an Islamic Leviathan as an appropriate political system in the Middle East. He asks the following: In the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa), what influences political attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan? To answer this question, he looks at the influence of seven independent variables on attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan as a state system. The seven variables are (1) society’s overall development, (2) the socioeconomic class of respondents, (3) society’s corruption, (4) religiosity, (5) education, (6) gender, and (7) age. The author finds the observations needed to assess his theory in the Carnegie Middle East Governance and Islam Dataset 1988-2014 (CMEGID), which includes 15,194 relevant observations throughout the MENA region. His findings show that societies’ overall development has the most influence over Arab attitudes toward the Islamic Leviathan as an appropriate state system.

T1  - The Culture of Cities: Measuring Perceived Cosmopolitanism
AN  - 1922247434
AB  - Cities like New York and San Francisco have a different feel than cities like Newark and Columbus. But can these differences be captured quantitatively? We argue these places vary along the dimension of cosmopolitanism, that is, the extent to which they offer economic opportunities and emphasize diversity, creativity, and egalitarianism. We present a Cosmopolitan City Scale (CCS) designed to assess perceived cosmopolitanism. The CCS has high internal reliability and correlates with objective indicators of cosmopolitanism such as intergenerational mobility and number of patents generated (Study 1). Consistent with the notion that people with an independent orientation migrate to cosmopolitan places, independence was associated with preference for cosmopolitan cities as measured by our scale (Study 2). High openness to experience, high extraversion, liberalism, high socioeconomic status, and single marital status were also related to greater preference for cosmopolitan cities. We believe the CCS provides a new tool for understanding how cities differ and helps clarify factors that drive migration preferences. We also discuss implications of cosmopolitanism for cultural processes such as acculturation and intergroup relations.

T1  - Struggle as opportunity: making sense of U.S. migration experiences through Buddhist practice
AN  - 1884460601
AB  - Recent scholarship demonstrates how immigrants rely on religion for resources and psychological and social support at various stages of migration. Many studies of religion focus on the institutional role of faith-based organisations, with little regard for the social importance of religious experiences in daily life. Using interviews with U.S. immigrants who identify as Buddhists, I examine how migrants use Buddhist philosophies as a lens for finding meaning in the struggles associated with migration, including language acquisition, employment, and legal status. Through their practice, migrants gain a sense of agency amid vulnerable circumstances. I also explore the potentially negative consequences of the practice's individual focus, including the propensity to mask structural causes of inequality and impede possibilities for collective action.

T1  - More than Just Insults: Rethinking Sociology's Contribution to Scholarship on Racial Microaggressions
AN  - 1888628530
AB  - Our goal with this special issue is to expand currently untapped ideas about racial microaggressions from a sociological point of view. As noted, research on this issue comes largely out of psychiatry, psychology, and education--disciplines that tend to place less emphasis on structural and institutional causes of racism. There is a need for more sociologically guided research to examine how subtle, covert, and non-apparent forms of racism affect minorities physiologically, psychologically, and emotionally--and how these micronooses can best be understood in a larger context of structural racism. Examination of racial microaggressions from a sociological point of view promises additional insight to help understand the complexities of contemporary race and racism in America and abroad.

T1  - "Race Tests": Racial Boundary Maintenance in White Evangelical Churches
AN  - 1888628505
AB  - How and why do nominally open organizations remain racially segregated in the post-civil rights era? What role do interpersonal interactions play in the perpetuation of segregation? Using ethnographic data gathered from seven, majority white, evangelical churches across four states, we find that social actors (i.e., clergy and congregants) play a central role in continuing racial segregation by executing "race tests" on people of color who attempt to gain entry to these spaces. Race tests are performances by white individuals and groups, in the presence of incoming people of color. They utilize racial microaggressions, playing on persistent racist stereotypes and/or histories of racial violence, to preclude or precondition people of color's participation in predominantly white social spaces. White actors in white social spaces initiate utility-based race tests to determine whether people of color are willing to serve the interests of whites in the space, or execute exclusionary race tests to coerce people of color into leaving the space. We provide examples of both types of race tests and discuss the role of such microaggressions and the racialized emotions at play in the reproduction of segregation in historically white social spaces like white evangelical churches.

T1  - Neighbours Helping Neighbours in Multi-ethnic Context
AN  - 1874317543
AB  - A key topic in population and urban studies is neighbourhood social relations. The topic has significant implications for the larger debate about friendship patterns in contemporary North American society. Ties among neighbours provide social support, foster social relations, and facilitate social capital. Our study explores how the exchange of favours among neighbours, a key component in developing and maintaining social relations among neighbours, is related to co-ethnic proportion, length of time in the neighbourhood, and family life cycle. Our discussion differentiates between relations within groups and overall relations in the neighbourhood. We merged the 2008 Canadian General Social Survey with 2006 Canadian census tract data to explore these issues. The findings present an optimistic view of a diversified society. Most members of the groups included in the analysis experience favour exchange with neighbours. Although co-ethnic proportion and duration in the neighbourhood do not relate to favour exchange in neighbourhoods for minorities and immigrants, these factors are significant for local-born population. In addition, as minorities and immigrants marry, their family needs may encourage them to develop social relations with neighbours. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Mogong and chieftaincy in western Guangxi and Southeast Asia
AN  - 1855702339
AB  - This article is devoted to establishing, by means of textual and comparative evidence, a link between the religious practitioners called mogong (Zh. bouxmo) and chiefly houses. The mogong are male priests who recite texts in the 'local' language, in this case Zhuang or Bouyei. They are also found among other Tai peoples, including the Dai in Yunnan, the Tày and Nùng in Vietnam, and also among other ethnic groups in mainland Southeast Asia. Theirs is a very ancient tradition, dating back possibly 2000 years. Most of the studies on mogong in the PRC have treated the mogong either as an instance of 'primitive religion' or as 'folk beliefs', and some scholars have declared that the mogong had no connection with politics or government. My argument, based on new evidence from a survey of Zhuang vernacular texts, is that the Zhuang mogong only became village-level vernacular priests after the disbandment of the native chieftaincies, starting in the early eighteenth century, and that before that they were attached directly to chiefly lineages, as they still were in Yunnan and in Southeast Asia until the 1940s. The mogong were responsible for the most important triennial sacrifices to the guardian spirits of the domain.

TT  - Attitudes envers 'l'étranger': négociations face à la différence au Royaume-Uni et en Pologne; Las actitudes hacia el 'desconocido': la negociación de encuentros con lo diferente en el Reino Unido y Polonia
AN  - 1848148756
AB  - Due to recent intensification in international mobility in Europe, its citizens are exposed to a much wider range of lifestyles and competing attitudes towards difference. Individuals are, therefore, increasingly likely to encounter 'strangers' and are, therefore, required to negotiate discontinuities and contradictions between the values that are transmitted through different sites. In response, the article explores the concept of the 'stranger' through original data collected in the UK and Poland. The article highlights that the construction of who is a stranger depends on national historical contexts, core values and related visions of the society. The UK and Poland have very different histories and experiences with social diversity, impacting on the ways in which individuals negotiate strange encounters. In both countries, the 'stranger' is often seen in a negative way and in relation to the minority groups that are perceived to be visibly different, distinct or 'unknown' in contemporary times. In Poland, this is now largely articulated through sexual prejudice (homophobia), whilst in the UK, attitudes towards the 'stranger' are largely conveyed through religious prejudice (Islamophobia). As such, the article offers a means of understanding how encounters with difference 'produce' strangers in different contexts.

T1  - Theory in Highly Cited Studies of Sexual Minority Parent Families: Variations and Implications
AN  - 1904237981
AB  - This article includes a systematic review and citation analysis of the literature regarding sexual minority parent families, particularly attending to what theories have been used, and how. We consider the importance of theoretical frameworks for future research and implications for policy, practice, and law related to sexual minority parent families. Our review targets 30 highly cited studies located through Google Scholar (as an interdisciplinary search engine) and published within a specific timeframe (2005-2010). We highlight the dominant theoretical models employed across disciplines studying sexual minority parent families. Although the majority of studies reviewed referred to theoretical models or perspectives, explicit theoretical grounding was frequently lacking. Instead, the empirical work reviewed appeared to have a predominantly applied focus in addressing public debates on sexual minority parent families. We provide recommendations for how theory might be more fully integrated into the social science literature on sexual minority parents and their children.

T1  - Fluid Identity, Fluid Citizenship: The Problem of Ethnicity in Postcommunist Romania
AN  - 1860810157
AB  - This article aims at capturing a paradoxical situation of modern Romanian nationalism that is both a symptom and a consequence of the country's postcommunist "liquid" modernity: the tension between the essentialist and the constructionist discourses related to nationalism and ethnic identity. Approaching this topic can be an important endeavor not only for a better understanding of the condition of an eminently liminal geography in Europe's late modernity (East/West, democracy/totalitarianism, tradition/modernity) but also for addressing two questions of major importance to political anthropology: (1) Which are the political consequences of exposing a certain community to the scientific discourse produced in the sphere of the social sciences about that very community? (2) How is it possible for modern national identity to be commodified and for citizenship to be contractualized?

T1  - "Grow the Beard, Wear the Costume": Resisting Weight and Sexual Orientation Stigmas in the Bear Subculture
AN  - 1831272479
AB  - Being gay and being overweight are two stigmatized statuses in the United States. A range of work has considered the experience of being stigmatized and the consequences of stereotypes for overweight individuals and sexual minorities, but less research has examined the intersection of these two stigmas among larger gay men or collective efforts to resist such stigma. This study qualitatively examines a subculture of gay men, the bears, to test theoretical models of stigma resistance. The analysis demonstrates the transferability of stigma resistance among multiple stigmatized attributes and the use of multiple strategies to resist one stigma. At the same time, it shows how subcultural dynamics both aid and undermine the resistance toward stigma, and the risk of reinforcing stigma's effect through criticizing others who embody a stereotype. The results also demonstrate how resistance strategies are both empowering and psychologically taxing for stigmatized individuals.

T1  - Turning points and transitions in the migratory trajectories of skilled Romanian immigrants in Spain
AN  - 1828221900
AB  - The academic interest on skilled migration patterns has increased at the same time as the flows of skilled migrants around the world. Despite this tendency, there is still a lack of knowledge regarding the migratory projects of particular ethnic communities or in specific receiving contexts. The current paper examines the migratory experiences of Romanian professionals and the extent to which the incorporation into the Spanish labor market represents a turning point or a transition in their overall life trajectory. Based on a qualitative design, the paper highlights how some profiles are more sensitive to sending and receiving contexts (structural elements), display strategies through mobilization of universities or social networks and shape disrupted trajectories. Others, respond to globalized dynamics, mobilize corporations and finally develop smooth labor transitions. The main elements explaining these patterns are tackled and explained in three profiles of professionals: those who arrive to Spain thanks to the transfer by a multinational company; those who complement their tertiary education with Master degree in Spain and finally, those who correspond to the economic migrant profile.

T1  - Riba-Based Mortgages in Dar al-Harb: An Issue of Modernist Application of Fiqh al-Aqalliyat for Muslim Minorities
AN  - 1827433539
AB  - The growing presence of Muslims in the occident living as minorities in majority non-Muslim countries comes with inherent religious challenges. How can occidental Muslims live faithfully in cultures that cause perceivable "hardship" without compromising their religio-legal obligations? Is fiqh al-aqalliyat the answer to this problem, if at all there is a problem? As a sample of the so-called "hardship", this paper looks at the issue of occidental Muslims taking out riba (interest or usury) based loans in order to buy a house, to test the theory of whether or not a new legal doctrine is required to facilitate Muslim needs facing exceptional circumstances. Is it a clash between classical and contemporary scholarship or an inevitable pre-modern evolution of Islamic jurisprudence? This article argues that juristic opinions, whether classical or contemporary do not justify any actions, because their opinions are first and foremost non-binding and secondly a result of their endeavor to come to an edict. The paper highlights a misapplication of juristic maxims and opinions, driven by zeal to provide an edict to justify the needs of some. It concludes that no added value is made to Islamic law by heterodox jurisprudence.

T1  - South Asian immigration to Spain: Socio-demographic profile and territorial distribution, 2000-2014
AN  - 1907273084
AB  - The South Asian group, which includes people from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, is one of the oldest and least known immigrant groups in Spain. Because of its relatively small size (131,230 in 2014) very limited research work has been done about this community. Existing studies mainly focus on their economic participation while their socio-demographic characteristics remain unexplored. In this paper, we examine the evolution and demographic profile of their flow and stock during 2000-2014, their socio-economic characteristics and territorial distribution. The recent huge flow of young males has made this group more masculine and younger. Their low education level and lack of professional skills result in occupational segregation in a few sectors, which is contributing to their residential concentration in the big metropolitan areas of Spain. The economic crisis in Spain has halted further growth, but the continuation of family reunification process is consolidating their settlement in Spain.

T1  - Opportunity Costs and Latinas' Family Formation Attitudes
AN  - 1785500848
AB  - Cultural ideals and acculturation influence Latinas' fertility-related attitudes and family size preferences within the context of the U.S. social and economic structure. In this context, there may be "costs" associated with enacting preferences favoring family building over other opportunities or demands. This article draws on data collected from focus groups conducted with college-educated Latinas in the Bronx, New York (n = 16) to demonstrate a conflict between cultural values and opportunity costs. The voices of these women not only echo an awareness of opportunity costs associated with childbearing (especially at a young age or having many children) but also acknowledge the influences of culture on the attitudes and behaviors of Latinas. In this conflict, ethnic identities are challenged and signs of internalized racism emerge.

T1  - Diaspora activism in a non-traditional country of destination: the case of Filipinos in the Netherlands
AN  - 1765125800
AB  - Diasporas have played important roles in democratization in their homelands. But how does diaspora mobilization occur when the country of settlement has a small and isolated ethnic community, the host and homeland governments have weak relations, and the conflict is invisible in the geographies of power? Using case study research, I analyse how solidarity groups in the Netherlands facilitated the emergence and growth of diaspora mobilization for democracy in the Philippines during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. My findings show that in cases where exiles and migrants lack pre-existing economic, political and social ties in the host society, solidarity groups can affect the political opportunity structure in the host country, permitting the promotion of certain claims and demands in the public sphere. Furthermore, diaspora mobilization can develop within the formal organizations or associational networks of solidarity groups.

T1  - Concealing Concealment: The Mediating Role of Internalized Heterosexism in Psychological Distress Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Older Adults
AN  - 1773059753
AB  - Recent population-based studies indicate that sexual minorities aged 50 and older experience significantly higher rates of psychological distress than their heterosexual age-peers. The minority stress model has been useful in explaining disparately high rates of psychological distress among younger sexual minorities. The purpose of this study is to test a hypothesized structural relationship between two minority stressors-internalized heterosexism and concealment of sexual orientation-and consequent psychological distress among a sample of 2,349 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults aged 50 to 95 years old. Structural equation modeling indicates that concealment has a nonsignificant direct effect on psychological distress but a significant indirect effect that is mediated through internalized heterosexism; the effect of concealment is itself concealed. This may explain divergent results regarding the role of concealment in psychological distress in other studies, and the implications will be discussed.

T1  - OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities on the Use of Languages in Relations with the Public Administration, and on the Supervision and Enforcement of Linguistic Requirements
AN  - 1855326201
AB  - Linguistic rights and their implications for societal cohesion and state stability, have been recognized as a core component in the conflict prevention work of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe High Commissioner on National Minorities (OSCE HCNM). Linguistic and associated rights proved a challenge in many OSCE Participating States, and the HCNM repeatedly advised the relevant authorities on how to secure a fair balance between the promotion of the state language and the protection of linguistic minority rights. This article overviews the advice which the successive HCNMs have throughout the years put forward on two key areas touching upon the linguistic rights of national minorities - namely, the use of languages in relations with the public administration, and the supervision and enforcement of linguistic requirements - and analyses how this advice aligns with the recommendations put forward by other international actors and institutions working on minority rights and minority issues.

T1  - Bridging and Bonding Ethnic Ties in Voluntary Organisations: A Multilevel 'Schools of Democracy' Model
AN  - 1784151611
AB  - Scholars of political disaffection have recently argued that ethnically bridging and bonding non-profit associations may have diverging effects on members' likelihood of political engagement. However, both theoretical and empirical assessments of such effects remain inconclusive by predicting different scenarios. In this article, I contribute to this literature by relying on a novel design, which does not focus on individuals (as in previous research), but instead samples ethnically homogeneous and heterogeneous organisations and their participants. This allows partitioning variance in political engagement at these two levels of analysis, and admits a more direct test of the link between ethnic composition of an organisation and political engagement. This sampling strategy also allows controlling for the effects of previously ignored organisational characteristics, which may enhance political engagement. A multilevel analysis suggests existing studies tend to overestimate the importance of an ethnically heterogeneous organisational context. Findings suggest that both types of voluntary organisations attract politically engaged individuals (self-selection). Moreover, other organisational characteristics-such as providing political information or receiving (local) government grants-have a stronger effect on members' political engagement than an organisation's ethnic composition.

T1  - Gender, Migration, and Religion: MENA Muslim Migrants in Australia from a Socio-demographic Perspective
AN  - 1752271488
AB  - Focusing on the issue of gender and Muslim minority communities in the West, this paper presents a typical pattern in order to examine the main dimensions and determinants associated with religion and gender identity upon migration. It also explains the existence and the extent of association between the socialization experience of women in their society of origin and their integration process in the receiving society. The examination focuses particularly on the intersection of gender, migration, and religion: the status of Muslim female immigrants residing in the West whose origin is from the Middle East and North Africa region in the East. The indicators used, the context of the study, the method of analysis, and the particular focus group of this study provide the opportunity to deal appropriately with the above key objective in this study.

T1  - Impossible Burdens: White Institutions, Emotional Labor, and Micro-Resistance
AN  - 1777916363
AB  - This article explores the connections between white institutional spaces, emotional labor, and resistance by illuminating the shared experiences of people of color in elite law schools and the commercial aviation industry. Based on in-depth qualitative data combined from two individual studies, we illustrate the processes by which white institutional spaces create a complex environment where people of color must navigate racial narratives, ideologies, and discourses, while simultaneously attempting to achieve institutional success to reap the material rewards of these elite institutional settings. In these distinct environments, people of color experience an unequal distribution of emotional labor as a result of negotiating both everyday racial micro-aggressions and dismissive dominant ideologies that deny the relevance of race and racism. As a result they must actively seek ways to engage in forms of resistance that promote counter narratives and protect themselves from denigration while minimizing the risk of severe consequence. Our data suggest that a more nuanced conceptualization of resistance and the context in which resistance occurs is needed in order to understand the everyday experiences of people of color.

T1  - CONTESTED TERRAIN
AN  - 1700674223; 201525154
AB  - Since 1969, the procurement powers of government have been used proactively to assist minority-owned businesses. Originating in the U.S. Small Business Administration, the practice of targeting procurement contracts to minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) has expanded throughout government and corporate America. Compared to other minorities, Black-owned firms have been the most active participants. Preferential procurement has been controversial for decades, and its effectiveness for assisting bona fide MBEs has been repeatedly questioned. 'Front-company' abuses have received abundant media attention; allegations of reverse discrimination have inspired legal challenges; the judiciary has often thrown out procurement preferences targeted to minorities. Less attention has focused on understanding whether racially targeted procurement preferences have assisted minority-owned businesses. As the multi-billion dollar government and corporate procurement market opened up, employment in Black-owned firms operating in the impacted industries soared. Growing access to procurement opportunities encouraged firm creation and expansion. Government entities operating successful programs actively screened out front firms, eased bonding requirements, downsized and unbundled contracts, and paid MBE vendor invoices promptly. In the process, they effectively lowered key barriers limiting MBE participation in mainstream procurement markets. Well-designed and administered programs succeeded because they created a less discriminatory environment, thus allowing talented entrepreneurs to build large firms. Problems notwithstanding, preferential procurement programs have been highly successful, and this success is a reflection of declining barriers unleashing the creativity of new generations of Black entrepreneurs.

T1  - Becoming a (Pan)ethnic Attorney: How Asian American and Latino Law Students Manage Dual Identities
AN  - 1700673416; 201525281
AB  - Managing professional and personal identities often belabor upwardly mobile racialized individuals. I examine in this article how Asian American and Latino law students negotiate (pan)ethnic identities while learning to become lawyers. I contend that managing dual identities creates (pan)ethnic duty among Asian American and Latino law students. I focus on those planning to work in law firms, at least initially. While there are many career options for law students, most, irrespective of race, pursue initial careers at law firms. What leads them there? How do racialization and expectations play a role in this career aspiration? And how do students negotiate the pressure to give back, or manage the internally/externally imposed duty they feel to serve respective communities? I find that Asian American and Latino law students draw on a repertoire of strategies (marginal panethnicity, tempered altruism, and instrumental ethnicity) that encompass different accounts, identities, and roles enabling creativity and elasticity for professional and personal identities. The findings suggest that panethnicity remains salient for upwardly mobile individuals of color, even those who do not ostensibly appear to be concerned with panethnic communities and causes.

T1  - Land, history or modernization? Explaining ethnic fractionalization
AN  - 1680153455; 201513974
AB  - Ethnic fractionalization (EF) is frequently used as an explanatory tool in models of economic development, civil war and public goods provision. However, if EF is endogenous to political and economic change, its utility for further research diminishes. This turns out not to be the case. This paper provides the first comprehensive model of EF as a dependent variable. It contributes new data on the founding date of the largest ethnic group in each state. It builds political and international variables into the analysis alongside historical and geoclimatic parameters. It extends previous work by testing models of politically relevant EF. In addition, this research interprets model results in light of competing theories of nationalism and political change. Results show that cross-national variation in EF is largely exogenous to modern politico-economic change. However, the data are inconclusive with respect to competing geoclimatic, historical institutional and modernist theories of ethnogenesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Formal Rights and Informal Privileges for Same-Sex Couples: Evidence from a National Survey Experiment
AN  - 1650145317; 201504421
AB  - Attitudes toward gay rights have liberalized over the past few decades, but scholars know less about the extent to which individuals in the United States exhibit subtle forms of prejudice toward lesbians and gays. To help address this issue, we offer a conceptualization of formal rights and informal privileges. Using original data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether people distinguish between formal rights (e.g., partnership benefits) and informal privileges (e.g., public displays of affection) in their attitudes toward same-sex couples. Results show that heterosexuals are as willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples as they are to unmarried heterosexual couples. However, they are less willing to grant informal privileges. Lesbians and gays are more willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples, but they too are sometimes more supportive of informal privileges for heterosexual couples. We also find that heterosexuals' attitudes toward marriage more closely align with their attitudes toward informal privileges than formal rights, whereas lesbians and gays view marriage similarly to both formal rights and informal privileges. Our findings highlight the need to examine multiple dimensions of sexual prejudice to help understand how informal types of prejudice persist as minority groups receive formal rights.

T1  - Indigenous Mobilisation and the Law of Consultation in Peru: A Boomerang Pattern?
AN  - 1735654862; 201536932
AB  - Prior to 2009, it was difficult to speak of a national level Indigenous movement in Peru with an impact on national politics. However, the situation changed after the tragic events known as the Baguazo. Little by little, diverse organisations representing different ethnic groups came together to push for a law of consultation, which was promulgated in 2011. Nevertheless, the process has been highly complex and is still ongoing. The aim of this article is to offer some interpretative clues in order to understand how the national level movement came about, as well as how it made an impact on national political processes. Referring to social movement theory and constructivist international relations theory, I analyse several important episodes between 2009 and 2013. I find that both the convergence and the impact of a national level Indigenous movement in Peru are embedded in complex bargaining processes in which issues of ethnicity and political opportunities at the national level have been affected by the leverage of global norms (specifically the International Labour Organisation's Covenant No. 169) by both international and national actors.

T1  - How did the empire strike back? Lessons for today from The Empire Strikes Back: Race and Racism in 70s' Britain
AN  - 1660021133; 201505674
AB  - The Empire Strikes Back made a landmark and sometimes controversial intervention in the scholarship of ethnicity and race when it was first published. This article considers both the continuities and breaks that linked and separated the volume from the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies' work and tradition that preceded it. It also suggests that the balance between ethnographic engagement and critical scholarship sets up a necessarily iterative process that values both but also recognizes the differences between the two. Such iteration speaks also to the manner in which the study of contemporary migration and its consequences demands both more self-conscious links between the study of migration and the scholarship of racial formation and ethnic identity.

T1  - The Changing Character and Survival Strategies of the Chinese Community in India
AN  - 1738476855; 201538494
AB  - The Chinese community has been settled in India for more than two centuries. Its relationship to the host society and to the authorities, first British and then Indian, has gone through different stages with different forms. It is important to examine the lives, traditions and attitudes of the Chinese community to understand its development and its changing character. This study argues that it is misleading to present this community as one that has always been marginalised and discriminated against in India. It examines the applicability of concepts such as 'sojourning', 'corridors' and 'middleman minority' to the community and its different sub-groups, both in British India and in post-independence India.

T1  - Race and Mortality Revisited
AN  - 1680152118; 201514063
AB  - In an article in the January/February 2000 issue of Society titled Race and Mortality, I explained the statistical pattern, inherent in other than highly irregular risk distributions, whereby the rarer an outcome, the greater tends to be the relative (percentage) difference between the rates at which advantaged and disadvantaged groups experience the outcome and the smaller tends to be the relative difference between rates at which such groups avoid the outcome. By way of example with respect to the health and healthcare outcomes on which the article principally focused, as mortality declines, relative differences in mortality tend to increase while relative differences in survival tend to decrease; as healthcare generally improves, relative differences in receipt of appropriate care tend to decrease while relative differences in failing to receive such care tend to increase.

T1  - An Intersectional Analysis to Explaining a Lack of Physical Activity Among Middle Class Black Women
AN  - 1559005147; 201432006
AB  - In this essay, I make the case that the intersectionality framework is useful to explain the high level of obesity among Black women. I describe how the intersectionality framework reformulates the examination of racial and gender disparities in health by deconstructing traditional frames of Whiteness and maleness. Next, I discuss key barriers that operate as mechanisms to reduce Black women's level of physical activity. Then, I provide ways to potentially combat these barriers. In doing so, I argue that being physically active is a privilege rooted in how race, place, gender, and body image converge differently on Black women's propensity to be physically active than other raced and gendered groups. Middle class Black women are excluded from class-based privileges and experience a form of space invasion where their temporal space, geographic space, and bodily space are invaded. In this regard, this research agenda is not solely about physical activity but rather how the structural arrangements of communities contribute to healthy lifestyles.

T1  - Xinjiang in 2013: problems and prospects
AN  - 1551002669; 201429042
AB  - Several major disturbances in Xinjiang in China's northwest in 2013 have further exacerbated the already tense ethnic relations between the Han Chinese and the main minority in Xinjiang, the Uighurs, who are Turkic and Muslim. The Chinese state blames terrorism but most Western journalists remain sceptical. This article argues that terrorism is indeed a real threat, but the Chinese state tends to overreact to disturbances, exacerbating the problems. China's response has included befriending countries further west, including Turkey. The outlook is not good for ethnic harmony, but the region is likely to develop economically and the prospects for independence or quasi-independence from China are very poor.

T1  - Social Exclusion of Children: Developmental Origins of Prejudice
AN  - 1543801910
AB  - Over the past decade, developmental and social psychological research has explicitly adopted a developmental intergroup framework, integrating social and developmental psychology fields to understand the origins of social exclusion and prejudice. This article argues that a social developmental analysis of how groups and individuals experience, evaluate, and understand exclusion is essential for a complete picture of the human experience, interpretation, and consequences of exclusion. What has been missing in much of the social psychological research on exclusion is an incorporation of developmental perspectives; likewise, what has been missing in development psychological research is a focus on group identity and group dynamics for understanding the basis for exclusionary behavior in childhood. Yet, the roots of adult forms of exclusion can be documented in childhood, and children who experience exclusion are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, and especially when exclusion is based on group membership. Moreover, interventions designed to ameliorate social problems associated with exclusion need to be based on an understanding of how, why, and under what conditions, children and groups make decisions to exclude others, how they experience this exclusion, and how exclusion originates and changes over the course of the lifespan. Thus, a growing body of psychological work, exemplified in this issue of the Journal of Social Issues (2014), highlights implications for theory in psychology and related social sciences, and for interventions and policies to tackle social exclusion.

T1  - Ultranationalist Genocides: Failures of Global Justice in Nigeria and Pakistan
AN  - 1718068018; 201530787
AB  - International law entered a period of accelerated change in the decade after the genocide of the Ibo people in Nigeria. By 1979, jurists had drafted much-needed reforms to international law in the areas of prohibited methods of war, the rights of refugees, and the infliction of severe pain to punish dissent or to discriminate on racial or religious grounds. These reforms, if implemented in good faith, provide a basis for international criminal tribunals to punish the widespread killing and abuse of civilians in non-international armed conflicts. International courts analysed few such conflicts in the decades after the Genocide Convention entered into force, despite the aim of the convention to prevent genocide by public or private actors, in time of war or peace, and by targeting a group in whole or in part. This article analyses the Ibo genocide in terms of the techniques used by the Nigerian army to destroy the Ibo ethnic group in substantial part, including massacres of Ibo civilians, imposition of widespread and disease epidemics on the Ibos, and rape of Ibos as a matter of policy. It surveys the influence of the Biafran genocide on the evolution of international norms relating to war crimes, refugees, and torture. The international community multiplied norms in lieu of enforcing them, in this case as in others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'We all eat the same bread': the roots and limits of cosmopolitan bridging ties developed by Romanians in London
AN  - 1520343212; 201413320
AB  - This paper investigates the social ties forged by Romanians in London with migrants of different origins in work and non-work contexts to offer a more nuanced view of 'bridging' social ties and related discussions of 'everyday' cosmopolitanism. Contrary to the overemphasis on ethnic ties seen as a form of bonding in migration research, the paper shows how Romanians bridge informally with many other migrants based on shared 'non-native' status. Alongside non-ethnically marked commonalities, ethnicity emerges as an important ingredient of cosmopolitan socialization, yet without necessarily signalling coexisting ethnic identities, as commonly assumed. Romanians' experiences further show that despite providing significant social and cultural capital, bridging ties with migrants, rather than natives, rarely accrue effective resources for social mobility. The findings suggest the need to disaggregate and qualify current understandings of 'bridging' social ties usually depicted in positive terms and uniformly as cross-ethnic relationships, or only linked with the 'mainstream' population.

T1  - War by Other Means: Cultural Policy and the Politics of Corporate Consociation in Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 1512219360; 201408797
AB  - Civil war obliterates memories of past coexistence. Yet, memories can also be erased through peacetime denial of legitimacy and funding to institutions preserving artifacts and remains testifying to a past of cultural hybridity. This article examines the interplay between cultural policy and constitutional framework in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) to explain the recent closure of Sarajevo's museums. It argues that the institutions' demise reflects a new state-building project founded on the separate development of mutually exclusive cultural and ethnic communities. Amnesia about past coexistence is instrumental to the political stability of BiH's corporate consociation but may hamper long-term conflict resolution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Everybody Writes": Readers and Editors and Their Interactions in the Polish-Language Press, 1922-1969
AN  - 1504421958; 201405486
AB  - In 1941, Antoni Wacyk, a reader of the Polish-language weekly Ameryka-Echo, wrote in his letter published in "Kacik dla Wszystkich" (Corner for everybody): "Take in your hand any issue of Ameryka-Echo, and you will see that the division into editors and subscribers does not exist here, that everybody writes. And what they write is beautiful. And it does not matter that it is sometimes grammatically incorrect." Wacyk belonged to the large and diasporic community of readers-writers in the "Corner," a section for letters from readers, which appeared in Ameryka-Echo between 1922 and 1969. The "Corner's" international reach, the longevity, vigor, and openness of its readers' discussions, the variety of topics, and diversity of readers and their interests created a unique public forum, where editors negotiated with readers the boundaries of their control over the section, and readers interacted among themselves without facilitation by the editors. The ethnic press has long been a focus of attention for historians and other social scientists. Recognized by historians as a rich source of information on the structure, developments, and issues in ethnic communities, with the views and opinions of its editors either shaping or reflecting positions of their immigrant audiences, the ethnic press returns time and again as a vital resource for historical research. Yet, we know very little about both the communities of readers and groups of editors, or about the nuances of the editorial process, which often involved readers as co-creators of the newspaper content, mainly through the publication of their letters.

T1  - National Identity and Group Narcissism as Predictors of Intergroup Attitudes Toward Undocumented Latino Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1494748570; 201402193
AB  - The debate surrounding immigration reform to address undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States has been emotionally charged and polarizing. This study's goal was to better understand some of the psychological predictors of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States, namely, collective identity as an American, group-level narcissism, and their interaction. A university sample (N = 223) completed an online survey measuring attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. As anticipated, we found that, at mean and high (but not low) levels of group narcissism, national in-group identification was a significant predictor of attitudes toward undocumented Latino immigrants. The implications of these findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed in light of the current debate on undocumented immigration in the United States.

T1  - Does Having a Kin State Lessen the Likelihood of Minorities Engaging in Secessionist Mobilization? An Analysis of the Moderating Influence of Kin States
AN  - 1463011779; 201345845
AB  - Existing research has demonstrated that the ability of secessionist movements to mobilize is highly contingent on assistance from external actors, especially via transborder ethnic ties. The specific relationship between kin state and kin group is seen as particularly enhancing to opportunities for secessionism/irredentism. Yet, the analysis of data (1989-2011) does not support this claim. Relatively few groups with kin states have engaged in violent secessionism, and these examples are mostly restricted to successor states from Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. Thus, this article argues that there are a number of reasons why the relationship between kin state and group increasingly engenders moderation. These reasons are the following: the failure of irredentism as a policy and idea; the asymmetric and problematic relations between kin state and group; and the protective capacity and the provision of resources by the kin state. As such, while external help is vital for secessionist groups to successfully mobilize, kin states typically provide assistance that fosters restraint and peace among their kin.

T1  - Cohesion without participation: immigration and migrants' associations in Italy
AN  - 1448995994; 201342879
AB  - Italian migration and citizenship policies tend to deny the fact that immigration in Italy is now a structural phenomenon embedded in the labour market and Italian society. The first part of Mantovan's article examines this denial in terms of the apparent difficulty many in Italian society have in accepting the social changes caused by Italy's rapid transition from a country of emigration to one of immigration. She argues that this reluctance to accept the fact of immigration is exacerbated by Italy's fragile national social cohesion, which has led to policy attempts to buttress social cohesion with respect to immigrants' relationship to Italian society. The Italian version of social cohesion is based on an 'implicit model' of immigrant integration and a citizenship regime defined by jus sanguinis. The second part of her paper evaluates Italian social cohesion as to how it manages the social changes caused by immigration, and looks at the evolution and characteristics of immigrants' participation in migrant associations. The principal measure adopted, that is, to include selected, co-opted migrant representatives from immigrant groups in consultative and advisory bodies, remained too dependent on the Italian authorities and voluntary organizations. These political migrants' associations ultimately failed, and led immigrants to withdraw and form their own cultural associations that better met their needs. Accordingly, the measures taken to promote migrants' participation through immigrants' associations functioned more as a mechanism to reduce ethnic complexity and the Otherness represented by migrants rather than as a viable, long-term means of facilitating their access to Italian citizenship. Overall, Italian policies have weakened social cohesion by reproducing and reinforcing structural inequalities among immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity and social cohesion in the post-Soviet Baltic states
AN  - 1448992675; 201342898
AB  - This article examines the efforts of post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to promote social cohesion by addressing the ethnic and linguistic cleavages that are part of the legacy of Soviet rule. In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers' sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.

T1  - "Every Shut Eye, Ain't Sleep": The Role of Racism-Related Vigilance in Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Sleep Difficulty
AN  - 1494749926; 201402049
AB  - Although racial/ethnic disparities in health have been well characterized in biomedical, public health, and social science research, the determinants of these disparities are still not well understood. Chronic psychosocial stress related specifically to the American experience of institutional and interpersonal racial discrimination may be an important determinant of these disparities, as a growing literature in separate scientific disciplines documents the adverse health effects of stress and the greater levels of stress experienced by non-white compared to white Americans. However, the empirical literature on the importance of stress for health and health disparities specifically due to racial discrimination, using population-representative data, is still small and mixed. In this paper, we explore the association between a novel measure of racially salient chronic stress-"racism-related vigilance"-and sleep difficulty. We found that, compared to the white adults in our sample, black (but not Hispanic) adults reported greater levels of vigilance. This vigilance was positively associated with sleep difficulty to similar degrees for all racial/ethnic groups in our sample (white, black, Hispanic). Black adults reported greater levels of sleep difficulty compared to white adults. This disparity was slightly attenuated after adjustment for education and income. However, this disparity was completely attenuated after adjustment for racism-related vigilance. We found similar patterns of results for Hispanic compared to white adults, however, the disparities in sleep difficulty were smaller and not statistically significant. Because of the importance of sleep quality to health, our results suggest that the anticipation of and perseveration about racial discrimination is an important determinant of racial disparities in health.

T1  - Choosing the Gorkha: at the crossroads of class and ethnicity in the Darjeeling hills
AN  - 1417525324; 201331866
AB  - The Darjeeling hills in northern West Bengal, India are being demanded as a homeland for the Gorkha community living in India. While the origin of Darjeeling is steeped in the imperial legacy of the British Raj, the Gorkha, a colonial construct is ironically used as a means to challenge the contemporary political regression and neo-colonisation of Darjeeling. Although the Gorkha identity is deemed as representative of the Nepali community residing in India, it acquires special meaning and importance in the Darjeeling hills, where majority of the people suffer low wages, unemployment, underdevelopment and poverty. In spite of a large working force in the tea estates, economic underdevelopment and political disempowerment is voiced through the assertion of ethnic rather than a class-based identity. Through an examination of the interaction between class and ethnicity, the Gorkha identity will highlight the malleability of ethnicity to extend itself to any situation and the emergence of an ethnic identity from class relations and grievances.

T1  - Contemporary Fertility Patterns and First-Birth Timing Among Mexican-Origin Women
AN  - 1429629454; 201335674
AB  - This article examines first-birth timing among Mexican women in the United States over two birth cohorts. Currently, Mexican women are one of a small group that maintains above-replacement fertility in the United States, contributing to both Mexican population growth and overall national population growth. Yet, the fertility timing of Mexican women has undergone a significant transformation over the past 40 years. Using the 1988, 1995, and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth, this article employs first-birth probabilities and Cox proportional hazard models to show how Mexican fertility timing differs from that of other major racial and ethnic groups. The evidence suggests that the racial/ethnic, nativity, and educational diversity of the Mexican-origin population has led to the emergence of two distinct patterns of first-birth timing. The findings from this study point to the need to reconsider the role of Mexican fertility timing in important national discussions of women's reproductive health and immigration/population polices.

T1  - Mortality salience and uncertainty: Similar effects but different processes
AN  - 1429629368; 201335604
AB  - Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Bangladeshi Migrant Workers in Hong Kong: Adaptation Strategies in an Ethnically Distant Destination
AN  - 1364702608; 201323279
AB  - The paper attempts to explore the adaptation-related challenges that Bangladeshi migrant workers in Hong Kong face and the strategies they adopt to triumph over them. Data were collected through administering both closed and open-ended questionnaires to 56 migrant workers in Hong Kong during 2005-2006. The study revealed that most of the respondents stayed in Hong Kong legally but worked illegally because of the fact that although they could extend their stay permits, they were not grated work permits. This exclusive circumstance places them in a number of difficult situations. In attempting to adapt to Hong Kong society, they embrace a number of interesting and unique strategies to surmount challenges. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Compare and contrast: understanding Irish migration to Britain in a wider context
AN  - 1429623954; 201335831
AB  - This article explores the potential for comparative research across different migrant groups. Research on migration is often weakened by the marked tendency to use a single ethnic/national group as the unit of analysis. Analysing migration from the experiences of a particular ethnic group may exaggerate ethnic exceptionalism and understate the extent to which experiences are shared across different migrant groups. My recent experiences on a range of research projects with diverse migrants to London made me think about similarities with the Irish, but each in different ways. However, there is a dearth of comparative analysis in relation to the Irish experience in Britain. On the one hand, there are many studies of Irish migrants, but these tend to focus solely on the Irish or else examine the relationship between Irish migrants and the 'native' British population. There has been little work on how the Irish relate to other migrant groups within British society. On the other hand, studies of other migrant communities rarely refer to the Irish as a comparative group. The article explores the reasons for the dearth of comparative work involving Irish migrants in Britain. In so doing, it considers some of the benefits and challenges of going beyond the 'ethnic lens'. What would be gained but also lost by viewing Irish migration to Britain through a more comparative perspective? I explore how such comparative analysis might contribute, firstly, to a wider understanding of migration processes, experiences and inter-migrant relations, and, secondly, to a fuller appreciation of varied dimensions of migratory experiences in Britain. These issues are considered through a comparison of Polish and Irish migration to Britain. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Towards Integration in Norway: Dynamics of Cultural Incorporation in the Context of Transnationalization
AN  - 1322723684; 201310853
AB  - This article aims to study the incorporation of homeland-based cultural practices of minorities within a majority cultural space and the dynamics of mutual incorporation of cultural practices of the majority and first-generation minority Tamils and Somalis in Norway. Homeland-based cultural practices refer to culturally rooted practices and habits that had been followed by Tamils and Somalis while they were living in their home country. While discussing tensions around the minority cultural practices in a majority cultural space, the article suggests a model for mutual incorporation of cultural practices of the majority and minorities.

T1  - The influence of racial histories on economic development strategies
AN  - 1373428349; 201328548
AB  - For more than a century, white communities across the United States employed strategies to remain all-white, including violent acts, forcibly driving minorities out of town, and local ordinances. One particularly widespread and effective approach used by many towns to exclude certain groups of people from living in their towns was the creation of a 'sundown town'. This paper seeks to examine the association between past sundown policies and one component of community life that many towns currently struggle with: economic development. By examining the racial histories and economic development activities of 428 towns in the Midwest and nontraditional South, the study examines whether historical legacy can carry over to the present and affect economic development. Findings suggest that former sundown towns currently pursue fewer economic development activities than towns that have a history of being inclusive, even after controlling for a community's assets.

T1  - Positive emotions and the social broadening effects of Barack Obama
AN  - 1622297820; 201438416
AB  - Past experiments have demonstrated that the cognitive broadening produced by positive emotions may extend to social contexts. Building on this evidence, we hypothesized that positive emotions triggered by thinking about Barack Obama may broaden and expand people's sense of self to include others. Results from an expressive-writing study demonstrated that African American college students prompted to write about Obama immediately prior to and after the 2008 presidential election used more plural self-references, fewer other-references, and more social references. Mediation analyses revealed that writing about Obama increased positive emotions, which in turn increased the likelihood that people thought in terms of more-inclusive superordinate categories (we and us rather than they and them). Implications of these findings for the role of positive emotions in perspective-taking and intergroup relations are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Hunkering Down' in Multi-Ethnic Neighbourhoods? The Effects of Ethnic Diversity on Dimensions of Social Cohesion
AN  - 1283639540; 201303325
AB  - Putnam (2007) claims that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods, residents of all ethnic groups tend to 'hunker down'. Solidarity and trust are lower, mutual help and cooperation rarer, and friends fewer. Various studies in the United States found a clear correlation between diversity and cohesion, and also for many different dimensions of social cohesion. Whether this finding also holds in other (European) settings is the subject of hot and unresolved debate. Specifically, this article addresses the question of whether living in an ethnically diverse setting has negative consequences for social cohesion in the Netherlands as well. Previous studies on the Netherlands remained inconclusive. We examine how this lack of consensus can be explained. To further the debate, this article pulls apart various contexts and various dimensions of social cohesion. This article examines the relationship between ethnic diversity (in socio-graphically defined neighbourhoods) and four dimensions of social cohesion (trust, informal help, voluntary work, and neighbourhood contacts) for the 50 largest cities in the Netherlands. We conclude that the Putnam hypothesis holds only to a limited extent in the Dutch context. The only aspect on which ethnic diversity has a negative effect is the degree of contact in the neighbourhood. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Relative Deprivation: A Theoretical and Meta-Analytic Review
AN  - 1023774637
AB  - Relative deprivation (RD) is the judgment that one is worse off compared to some standard accompanied by feelings of anger and resentment. Social scientists use RD to predict a wide range of significant outcome variables: collective action, individual achievement and deviance, intergroup attitudes, and physical and mental health. But the results are often weak and inconsistent. The authors draw on a theoretical and meta-analytic review (210 studies composing 293 independent samples, 421 tests, and 186,073 respondents) to present a model that integrates group and individual RD. RD measures that (a) include justice-related affect, (b) match the outcome level of analysis, and (c) use higher quality measures yield significantly stronger relationships. Future research should focus on appropriate RD measurement, angry resentment, and the inclusion of theoretically relevant situational appraisals. Such methodological improvements would revitalize RD as a useful social psychological predictor of a wide range of important individual and social processes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Age and the Cost of Being Uyghurs in Urumchi
AN  - 1125219288; 201240536
AB  - This article asks: is the cost of being Uyghurs higher for young Uyghurs than for old Uyghurs in Urumchi? I address this question with data from a survey of 2,947 people conducted in Urumchi in 2005. The cost of being Uyghurs refers to the extent of economic inequality in the earnings of Han Chinese and Uyghurs. I develop three hypotheses on the effect of age on earnings differentials between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. Data analyses show that although young Uyghurs are better educated and earn more than old Uyghurs, they are more likely than old Uyghurs to suffer from being Uyghurs in Urumchi. This finding has policy implications for the reduction of ethnic disparity in Xinjiang. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Introduction: gender, migration and the media
AN  - 1567049081; 201435124
AB  - Mediated representations of gender, ethnicity and migration play an increasingly important role in the way these categories are understood in the public sphere and the private realm. As media often intervene in processes of individual and institutional communication, they provide frameworks for the production and consumption of representations of these categories. Thus media -- in their production, representations and consumption -- need to be analysed, not only as reflections as pre-existing socio-political realities, but also as constitutive elements in the production of meanings of the self and the Other. This special issue includes a number of articles that examine the articulations of gendered ethnic identities and of gendered citizenship as these are shaped in media production, media representations and media consumption.

T1  - Citizenship, Co-ethnic Populations, and Employment Probabilities of Immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1125224053; 201240353
AB  - Over the last decades, Sweden has liberalized its citizenship policy by reducing the required number of years of residency to 5 years for foreign citizens and only 2 years for Nordic citizens. Dual citizenship has been allowed since 2001. During the same period, immigration patterns by country of birth changed substantially, with an increasing number of immigrants arriving from non-western countries. Furthermore, immigrants were settling in larger cities as opposed to smaller towns as was the case before. Interestingly, the employment integration of immigrants has declined gradually, and in 2006, the employment rate for foreign-born individuals is substantially lower compared with the native-born. The aim of this paper is to explore the link between citizenship and employment probabilities for immigrants in Sweden, controlling for a range of demographic, human capital, and municipal characteristics such as city and co-ethnic population size. The information we employ for this analysis consists of register data on the whole population of Sweden held by Statistics Sweden for the year 2006. The basic register, STATIV, includes demographic, socio-economic, and immigrant specific information. In this paper, we used instrumental variable regression to examine the "clean" impact of citizenship acquisition and the size of the co-immigrant population on the probability of being employed. In contrast to Scott (2008), we find that citizenship acquisition has a positive impact for a number of immigrant groups. This is particularly the case for non-EU/non-North American immigrants. In terms of intake class, refugees appear to experience substantial gains from citizenship acquisition (this is not, however, the case for immigrants entering as family class). We find that the impact of the co-immigrant population is particularly important for immigrants from Asia and Africa. These are also the countries that have the lowest employment rate.

T1  - Bullying of Mexican Immigrant Students by Mexican American Students: An Examination of Intracultural Bullying
AN  - 1023027364; 201223916
AB  - This article reports on a study using qualitative methods to investigate intracultural bullying, specifically, bullying between Mexican American (MA) and Mexican immigrant (MI) high school students. Previous research has reported specific cultural conflicts and discrimination within ethnic groups due to differences in acculturation. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this phenomenon is reflected in bullying within a high school context. In-depth interviews are conducted with 6 students from each group (MA and MI) in Grades 9 through 12 at a predominantly Hispanic public school in the state of Washington. The data reveal that bullying does occur between the two groups, with Mexican American students consistently bullying Mexican immigrant students. Two major themes emerge from the data: language barrier and superiority. There are also four themes that arise from the Mexican American student participants that were not found among the Mexican immigrant student responses. These themes are bullying cycle, isolation, alienation, and school factors. Recommendations for practice are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

When seen in minorities, the positive relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure invites hypotheses about potential mediators of the relationship. We investigated the relationship in Hispanics of primarily Mexican descent and included measures of hostility, locus of control and perceived racial discrimination hypothesized to mediate higher blood pressure. Regression analysis revealed no relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure but correlations between hypothesized mediators were significant and explicable. Cynical hostility and external locus of control were positively associated with perceived racial discrimination. We reasoned that the chronic experience of racial discrimination reinforces the perception of discrimination and feeds both external locus of control and cynical hostility despite no corresponding unfavorable effect on blood pressure.

T1  - Unequal recognition, misrecognition and injustice: The case of religious minorities in Denmark
AN  - 1081864723; 201235284
AB  - Euro-multiculturalism is (1) concerned with religiously defined immigrant minorities; (2) sees policies of recognition as a means to secure multicultural equality between groups; (3) endorses the moderate secularism of European states; and (4) adopts a contextualist approach to answering the normative question. Proponents of 'Euro-multiculturalism' want to ask when unequal recognition by the state of religious communities is a form of misrecognition and when it is unjust (or wrong). The article discusses the question by way of an examination of the Danish case of unequal recognition by the state of religious minorities. It argues that state-religion relations can be analysed as relations of recognition, which are not only unequal but also multi-dimensional, and that it is difficult to answer the question whether multi-dimensional recognitive inequalities are unjust or wrong if one endorses moderate secularism and contextualism.

T1  - A Network Approach to the Study of the World Uyghur Congress' Global Outreach: A Methodological Note
AN  - 1492599367; 201400183
AB  - This methodological note is to introduce new social network analysis (SNA) data sets that can be used to visualize and analyze the global linkages of the World Uyghur Congress (WUC). The results show that first of all, the WUC and Rebiya Kadeer play central roles in mobilizing political activity around the globe. Second, human rights NGOs and other organizations from the Uyghur diaspora pervade the networks of the WUC, and are spearheading the coordination of events and the exchange of information. Third, the WUC is keen on connecting with government representatives and journalists. Fourth, a growing number of links exist between the WUC and news organizations. Such links are most obvious among news organizations situated within the same country, when a Uyghur-related event occurs. A quintessential example is observed in the SNA map, where Japanese press and media showed interest in reporting Uyghur news when WUC Secretary General Dolkun Isa visited Japan to promote the Uyghur issue in 2006. A case study of Uyghur linkages in Australia further demonstrates WUC influence over Uyghur activism in various corners of the world. The purpose of this paper is not only to provide the first visualization and empirical test in regard to WUC networks that China's government and various China observers have believed to exist. With this document, I also demonstrate how a network approach can provide alternate ways for researchers to conduct their respective studies on diasporic networks of Tibetans, Taiwanese, or Chinese.

T1  - Greek American Identities in the 21st Century: A Generational Approach
AN  - 1641424405; 201500227
AB  - For more than a century, researchers have attempted to interpret and understand the assimilation/acculturation process and identity of immigrant ethnic groups in the United States. During the early 1900s, the term melting pot came into general usage to describe the emergence of the new immigrant American. Based on both the metaphor and the sociological melting pot theory, it was assumed that immigrants like ingredients mixed in a pot, would eventually blend into one mainstream culture and lose their own distinctions over time. It was concluded that by the third generation, grandchildren of immigrants would have completely assimilated into the American society, leaving behind all traces of ethnicity. Subsequent studies supported this hypothesis by demonstrating that ethnic Americans become less ethnic over several generations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Slavic Muslims: The forgotten minority of Macedonia
AN  - 1373429797; 201328661
AB  - Despite the International Community's long running effort to foster an atmosphere of stability, progress and development, (FYR) Macedonia remains marred in interethnic tension between the Macedonian and Albanian communities. This tension has stunted all progress in a country beset by a plethora of crises ranging from chronic unemployment and corruption to increasing poverty, faltering EU and NATO candidacies as well as a protracted dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country. Until the underlying inter-ethnic tension is soothed all other issues will remain unresolved. The thesis of this paper argues that the key to creating lasting stability in (FYR) Macedonia lies with the empowerment of the country's large minority communities. The article examines one such community, the Slavic Muslims, in detail and provides justifications and recommendations for their inclusion in the decision making process. The article aims to provide a policy alternative for the International Community in general and the OSCE in particular. Given that the OSCE Mission to Skopje is the Organisation's longest serving field operation and tensions still remain extremely high; it is clear that new and innovative approaches must be taken to finally create the stability that has proved so elusive since the country's independence.

T1  - Embodied Migration: Performance Practices of Diasporic Sri Lankan Tamil Communities in London
AN  - 1364700158; 201323363
AB  - This paper examines issues of embodied performativity and transmission of dance practices amongst Sri Lankan Tamil Hindus in the suburbs of London, focusing on how the experience of migration has shaped the making of cultural and ethnic identities. Using data gathered from recent ethnographic work in British Tamil temples and in the Tamil community, it addresses the complex discourse between the religious and political sense of selfhood articulated in these Sri Lankan Tamil groups, particularly in relation to dance and ritual performance, and seeks to answer questions regarding the place of dance and movement in defining such identity. In addition, I note the expansion in transmission and performance of the classical dance form of Bharatanatyam in British temple locations and the presence of trance dancing at Hindu festivals, and question how investigating migration as embodied practice might lead to greater understanding of such highly politicised contexts.

T1  - Mobilizing Race, Class, And Gender Discourses In A Metropolitan Community Church
AN  - 1347781261; 201318921
AB  - Drawing on principles of intersectionality, I explore how members of a southeastern Metropolitan Community Church use race, class, and gender discourses to construct and signify moral identities as Christian sexual minorities. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork, I demonstrate how members mobilized discourses emphasizing the incorporation of racial diversity, the minimization of class distinctions, and the equalization of gender categories within the church to signify their own moral worth. Moreover, I show how members anchored these discourses in the authority of Biblical scripture, which allowed them to claim moral standing within the larger Christian tradition while minimizing the tension between their sexual and religious identity claims. In conclusion, I draw out two central implications of this work: (1) how race, class, and gender discourses may provide symbolic resources for integrating sexual and religious identities and locally constructing sexual and religious morality; and (2) the importance of intersectional analyses for assessing LGBT religious experience.

T1  - When High Group Status Becomes a Burden: Requesting Outgroup Help and Spying by Members of High and Low Status Groups
AN  - 1221407584; 201243947
AB  - The present paper investigates the strategic motives that guide the quest for outgroup resources. Resources can be retrieved through spying and requesting help. Whereas both methods are means of obtaining valued resources from the outgroup, spying secures the ingroup's public image, while requesting help potentially damages this image by displaying the ingroup as incompetent and dependent. Two experiments (N = 99 and N = 99) supported the prediction that, when social change is feasible, members of high status groups spy more on the lower status group than vice versa. No difference was found in either study in the amount of help requested from the outgroup. Results from the second study showed that the effect did not occur when status relations were legitimate and thus unlikely to change. These findings advance our understanding of intergroup helping by demonstrating that strategic motives fundamentally shape aspects of help-seeking between groups. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1081865703; 201235274
AB  - This paper discusses multidimensional aspects of identity formation in a European context, referring to Polish migrants' experiences of migration in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Its aim is to understand the dynamics inherent in the process of identity construction by exploring the incidence of multiple ethnic identities among Polish nationals. To this end, following theoretical consideration on a sense of belonging and boundary making mechanisms in contemporary societies, it examines the incidence of Polish, local. European and cosmopolitan identities among migrants. It then points out at contradictions between different layers of belonging and explores the situations in which they occur. The paper draws on the findings of a one year long ethnographic fieldwork and uses the results of participant observation and in-depth interviews. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Personal wellbeing among ethnic Koreans in China's Northeast
AN  - 1023029104; 201223934
AB  - This study investigates personal wellbeing among a sample of ethnic Koreans in China's Northeast using the eight-item Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI). The PWI demonstrated good psychometric properties, consistent with previous studies. The data revealed a moderate level of personal wellbeing (PWI score = 70.3) and the results supported the Theory of Subjective Wellbeing Homeostasis, suggesting that strong external and internal buffers protect the HPM for ethnic Koreans, despite the onslaught of marketisation and urbanisation in China that are threatening to undermine Koreans' sense of ethnic identity. The predictors of personal wellbeing were found to be age (with a nonlinear relationship), education, gender, income, marital status and the city in which the individual lives.

T1  - 'Controlled Disruptions': How Ethnic Organizations Shape White Ethnic Symbolic Identities
AN  - 1018359574; 201212871
AB  - While connecting individual ethnic practices with global identity projects remains challenging, ethnic organizations provide a possible place where the negotiation and enactment of both occur. This article investigates how organized performances and competitions of symbolic white ethnic identity become structurally similar at a global level while also at the same time integrating disruptions at the local level. Specifically, the author argues that a hierarchy of particular Irish step dance practices emerged through controlled disruptions within and among dance academies and regulatory organizations in the social field of Irish step dance, sanctioning modified forms of Irishness believed to be most competitive in Ireland. This article examines the role that organizations play in sanctioning world models and controlling disruptions in the everyday symbolic enactment of Irish identity.

T1  - Motivation losses in teamwork: The effects of team diversity and equity sensitivity on reactions to free-riding
AN  - 1907331091
AB  - Team diversity may lead to a categorization of teammates as ingroup versus outgroup members. Therefore, the question arises whether there would be more permissiveness in reaction to ingroup free-riders than outgroup free-riders. To test this hypothesis, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two reward conditions (equity versus equality) and had to work with a partner who obviously underachieved and supposedly belonged to the same or a different group with regard to cognitive style. In addition, we assessed subjects' individual sensitivity to equity norms, assuming that this would be a further moderator of the sucker effect. As expected, significant interaction effects on individual performance occurred for both variables.

T1  - Mobilization of irregular migrants in Europe: a comparative analysis
AN  - 907925863; 201124647
AB  - Why and how do those who by definition seek to avoid the attention of the public and who lack resources manage to mobilize collectively? Comparing the situation of irregular migrants in three European cities (Copenhagen, London and Paris), this article aims to provide some understanding of the reasons for the mobilization, or absence of mobilization, of irregular migrants. It also seeks to explore the processes of development in these movements. In exploring the determinants and modes of irregular migrant mobilizations, this paper builds on Axel Honneth's theory of recognition and expands the analysis provided by theories of social movements of the passage from individual suffering to collective action.

T1  - Arab Americans' Opinion on Counterterrorism Measures: The Impact of Race, Ethnicity, and Religion
AN  - 907926847; 201124785
AB  - While domestic and international terrorism have become the focal concern of the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, little is known about Arab Americans' attitudes toward counterterrorism policies that center on aggressive law enforcement practices. Using survey data collected from 810 Arab Americans, this study reported the general pattern of support for antiterrorism measures, including surveillance, stop and search, and detention, and examined the effects of race, ethnicity, and religion on measures targeting the U.S. citizens generally and Arab Americans specifically. The results revealed that the majority of Arab Americans showed weak to modest support for aggressive law enforcement practice, especially those targeting Arab Americans. Arab Americans' attitudes toward antiterrorism measures were significantly related to their ethnic identities and religion with those who identified themselves as Arab Americans and Muslim showing less favorable attitudes toward counterterrorism measures. Arab Americans' confidence in the federal government was also found to be positively associated with support for antiterrorism practices. Implications for research and policy are discussed.

T1  - African-American Lesbian Identity Management and Identity Development in the Context of Family and Community
AN  - 902085265; 201122283
AB  - Don't Ask, Don't Tell is gaining attention in family studies literature as a cultural specific context to understand lesbian, gay, and bisexual visibility in African-American families and communities. This policy suggests that sexual minorities are accepted within African-American families and communities as long as they do not label themselves or acknowledge publicly that they engage in same-sex relationships. The narratives of two African-American lesbians (aged 26 and 27 years) are chronicled in the present study to reveal their lesbian identity development, lesbian identity management, and how they defined and navigated Don't Ask, Don't Tell. They encountered challenges and successes in a quest to find communities that would embrace and affirm their multiple marginalized identities. Their stories are offered as a point of entry to further inquiry concerning African-American lesbian visibility and identity proclamation within African-American families and communities.

T1  - Islamic Activism and Immigrant Integration: Turkish Organizations in Germany
AN  - 870433595; 201114331
AB  - This article compares the four largest Turkish Islamic organisations -- Diyanet, Milli Gorus, the Suleymanl(dotless i) and the Gulen communities -- in Germany in order to facilitate a clearer understanding of the role of Islamic organisations in Muslim immigrant integration. In Germany, where integration policies fall between the multiculturalist and assimilationist paradigms, Turkish Muslims constitute the largest ethnic community originating in Muslim majority countries. This study argues that it is not helpful to group all Islamic organisations together because they each have different fields of activity upon which they concentrate their resources. Each Islamic organisation should be analysed separately as this permits the categorisation of the activities and characteristics of Islamic organisations into those that promote or hinder integration.

T1  - Ali's Disappearance: The Tension of Moving and Dwelling in the Norwegian Welfare Society
AN  - 852898090; 201103220
AB  - In this article I address the tension--experienced by many young migrants--between pursuing individual goals and dreams for the future in Norwegian society, and fulfilling their responsibilities to family, kin and ethnic community. The discussion starts with the story of Ali, a young Somali boy who was sent abroad by his relatives in Norway to look after an aunt in Italy. The discussion centres around three issues. The first concerns the nomadic habitus and its relation to person, space and place; the second is about how space and self are constructed in the Norwegian welfare discourse of integration; and the third explores the overlapping expectations and interests implied in these different ways of structuring individuality and collectivity. The article concludes by emphasising the importance of considering both collective and individual motives, drives and responsibilities in analysing the lives of young migrants.

T1  - The Moderating Capacity of Racial Identity Between Perceived Discrimination and Psychological Well-Being Over Time Among African American Youth
AN  - 919905258; 201201730
AB  - This study examined the influence of racial identity in the longitudinal relation between perceptions of racial discrimination and psychological well-being for approximately 560 African American youth. Latent curve modeling (LCM) and parallel process multiple-indicator LCMs with latent moderators were used to assess whether perceptions of racial discrimination predicted the intercept (initial levels) and the slope (rate of change) of psychological well-being over time, and whether racial identity moderates these relations. The results indicated that African American adolescents who reported higher psychological responses to discrimination frequency levels at the first time point had lower initial levels of well-being. Regressing the slope factor for psychological well-being on the frequency of discrimination also revealed a nonsignificant result for subsequent well-being levels. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Introductory Study: Civil Society Actors and the International Protection Regime for Minorities
AN  - 896195928; 201120110
AB  - This article is a first step in a research project that studies the existence, identity and agency of civil society actors that engage directly with the international minority protection regime. It provides a preliminary description and typology of civil society actors focusing exclusively on minority protection and presents a dataset on these actors constructed from a wide range of sources, including the Yearbook of International Organizations. It also gives an insight into the agency and influence of civil society actors specialising in minority protection by looking at some of their strategies for norm entrepreneurship, also drawing from the findings of contributors to this special issue. By outlining a research agenda, this article identifies questions that explore the perspectives of civil society actors on the weaknesses and strengths of the current international minority protection regime with a view to identifying potential pathways for its improvement.

T1  - Attitudinal and sociostructural factors and their role in dialect change: Testing a model of subjective factors
AN  - 887499853; 201118951
AB  - The causation of language change is a problem with a high profile in sociolinguistics. This paper presents two contrasting models of language change: one that is based on sociopsychological factors (Kristiansen & Jorgensen, 2005) and one that rejects them (the Napoleon Principle, Brink & Lund, 1979). In a longitudinal study of individuals' changing pronunciation of the Danish aj-diphthong over 20 years, we test predictions following from the sociopsychologically oriented model. By the mid-1980s, female speakers used more aj-pronunciations that are associated with high socioeconomic status than did male speakers. However, in guise tests, females revealed a more positive attitude toward speech associated with low socioeconomic status. Our prediction that female speakers would change their speech patterns to include more aj-pronunciations associated with low socioeconomic status is supported by an analysis of the same female speakers' pronunciations as recorded in the mid-2000S.

T1  - Immigration and Intermarriage Among Hispanics: Crossing Racial and Generational Boundaries
AN  - 1429629200; 201335778
AB  - Rates of Hispanic intermarriage with whites declined for the first time during the 1990s. One hypothesis, which we test here, is that the recent influx of new immigrants has provided an expanding marriage market for Hispanics, reinforced cultural and ethnic identity, and slowed the process of marital assimilation. In this article, we use data from the March Current Population Survey (1995-2008) to identify generational differences in Hispanic-white intermarriage. The results indicate that second-generation Hispanics were more likely to marry first- rather than third-generation Hispanics or whites, a pattern that was reinforced over the study period. The results suggest declining rates of intermarriage among second-generation Hispanics-a pattern that diverges sharply from those observed among third-plus-generation Hispanics, where in-marriage with other Hispanics declined over time. If couched in the language of straight line assimilation theory, third-plus-generation Hispanics are assimilating by increasingly marrying other third-generation co-ethnics and whites. On the other hand, assimilation among the second-generation is slowing down as its members increasingly reconnect to their native culture by marrying immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Who Counts as a Muslim? Identity, Multiplicity and Politics
AN  - 1081861794; 201235228
AB  - My aim in this paper is to carve out a political understanding of the Muslim identity. The Muslim identity is shaped within a religious mold. Inseparable from this religious understanding is a political one that is valuable in its own right in order to secure any sustainable possibility of participating politically as Muslims within a democratic liberal democracy, such as the United States. Here I explore not the historical or theological formation of the Muslim identity, rather a metaphysical understanding of it, in order to mobilize politically while avoiding the traps of essentialism. I begin with a brief overview of the early understandings of the term 'identity politics' in the United States. Moving beyond interest-based movements I explore Maria Lugones' particular understanding of the self as multiplicitous. I then offer examples of the Muslim identity within the context of a social movement and individualist claims, in order to draw out the political aspects of the Muslim identity. In the final section I argue that the theological criteria that define 'who counts as a Muslim' is a crucial aspect of how many Muslims may understand their identity as Muslims. However, I claim that in order to avoid the traps of marginalization of Muslim minorities, one must understand oneself as a multiplicitous political agent and that, furthermore, such an understanding is not at odds with Islam or one's own understanding of their identity as Muslim.

T1  - Drawing Attention to A Public Deficit: Sociological Self-Reflections on Growing Up with ADD
AN  - 1037879272; 201230910
AB  - This article explores my own personal struggles with Attention Deficit Disorder as well as the larger implications of the disorder facing society as a whole through the lenses of both micro and macro sociological theories and concepts using a sociological imagination framework. It also works towards breaking down the common beliefs and misconceptions in society about what exactly having ADD entails, and how on a personal level one can work to combat these misconceptions. As a person with Attention Deficit Disorder taking the step of sharing her story in this paper, I believe it is important to work toward a paradigm shift in how the world views ADD, because for those who have ADD, the greatest barrier to the diagnosis is the public perception.

T1  - Are local health department expenditures related to racial disparities in mortality
AN  - 852898419; 201103247
AB  - This study estimated whether 1990-1997 changes in expenditures per capita of local health departments (LHDs) and percentage share of local public revenue allocated to LHDs were associated inversely with 1990-1997 changes in mortality rates for Black and White racial/ethnic groups in the US. Population was 883 local jurisdictions with 1990 and 1997 mortality rates for Black and White racial populations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wonder Compressed Mortality File and LHD expenditures from the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Using a time-trend ecologic design, changes in LHD expenditures per capita and percentage share of public revenue were not related to reductions in Black/White disparities in total, all-cause mortality rates. Increased LHD expenditures or percentage share were associated with reduced Black/White disparities for adults aged 15-44 and males. LHD expenditures or percentage share were related to absolute reductions in mortality for infants, Blacks, and White females but did not close Black-White mortality differences for these groups. Therefore, disparities in Black and White mortality rates for subgroups with the greatest mortality gaps may be more likely to be reduced by public investment in local health departments than disparities in Black and White total, all-cause mortality rates.

T1  - Understanding the Occurrence of Interracial Marriage in the United States Through Differential Assimilation
AN  - 835111551; 201100517
AB  - American society is undergoing unprecedented cultural changes in the 21st century. This social transformation began with the civil rights movement in the 1960s. As the United States becomes more diverse, both racially and ethnically, equal access to a variety of social institutions and organizations becomes more challenging. With respect to marriage, popular media continually report the blurring of boundaries between racial and ethnic groups. As a result, there has been a tremendous increase in interracial dating and marriage over the past several decades. There are considerable differences between the occurrence of interracial dating and interracial marriage. Data suggest that there is a much higher level of interracial dating in comparison to interracial marriage. This research effort focuses on trends in interracial marriages in the United States between 1980 and 2006. Information from the U.S. Census Bureau was used to analyze changes in the number and frequency of interracial marriages in American society over a 22-year time frame. Differential assimilation is employed for understanding interracial marriage trends and distinguishing important statistical differences between marriages with a Black1 spouse and those interracial marriages not involving a Black spouse. This exploration provides important empirical findings for assessing the progress of assimilation in America. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AB  - With this issue we complete Volume 33 of Ethnic and Racial Studies. This has been another successful year in the development of this journal, as reflected in the quality of the regular articles that we have published and in the articles included in the five special issues we have produced in 2010. The impact of the journal on the wider scholarly communities has been reflected in the increased Impact Factor we have been awarded in the ISI Social Science Citation Index for 2009, published in 2010. It is also evident in the increased volume of high-quality submissions that we receive in the editorial office from an increasing range of countries and research groupings. During boeth 2009 and 2010 we have seen significant increases in the submission of both regular and special issue articles to the journal. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When yielding pieces of the pie is not a piece of cake: Identity-based intergroup effects in negotiations
AN  - 822518948; 201068358
AB  - The present research intends to shed light on an identity-based intergroup effect in negotiations by demonstrating that the mere perception of the negotiation as an instance of intergroup interaction suffices to impair the negotiation process and to deteriorate its outcomes. It was predicted that negotiators' salient group identities increase their competitive perceptions, reduce their concession behavior, and consequently lead to inferior negotiation outcomes. Study 1 revealed that solo negotiators with salient group identities achieved lower joint outcomes than negotiators with salient individual identities. Study 2 systematically explored the underlying mechanisms of this identity-based intergroup effect by analyzing negotiators' concession-making behaviors over the course of the negotiation. The results of the second experiment replicate the findings of the first study and further show that the detrimental effect of an identity-based intergroup context will occur in distributive as well as integrative negotiations. The findings of the present research are discussed with respect to their contribution to future research on intergroup negotiation.

T1  - "Learn Something from This!" The Problem of Optional Ethnicity on America's Next Top Model
AN  - 758124806; 201057092
AB  - America's Next Top Model (ANTM), the popular reality television show produced by and starring Tyra Banks, has garnered a sizeable audience over its thirteen seasons. Synergistically marketed to readers of Young People and Teen Magazine, ANTM enjoys an audience of five million viewers mostly from the 18-35 year-old female demographic. This essay explores representations of ethnic and gendered identities constructed through the visual and discursive rhetoric of ANTM. ANTM judges define "model" femininity as those contestants whose look is "a blank palette" or "androgynous," descriptors that signal unmarked whiteness, while nonwhite women are most often marked as "exotic" or eliminated for being "too ethnic." This essay argues that despite Banks's expressed desire to help more women of color into the modeling business, ANTM participates in emerging, neoliberal understandings of racial and gendered identities, which, characterized by a hegemonic post-feminist and post-race worldview, obscure the operating of privilege in the young women's "choices" of how and when to perform their ethnicities. Rejecting the ANTM judges' claims to objectivity, this essay attempts to situate the gaze of the fashion industry and its aesthetic knowledge through its unspoken reliance on the notion of "optional" ethnic identity.

T1  - Measuring ethnicity: challenges and opportunities for survey research
AN  - 754043617; 201053288
AB  - Measuring ethnic identity in social surveys has traditionally been problematic, often using a single question and allowing the respondent to choose one category from a pre-defined list. In this paper we discuss the rationale for and limitations of measuring a complex and multi-dimensional concept with a simple, uni-dimensional question. We propose that operationalizing ethnicity as multi-dimensional requires multiple questions to capture the complexity of the concept. Giving researchers a number of different measures enables them to focus on the dimensions of interest to them, and has the potential to open up the rich resources of theoretically robust survey research to researchers from a range of disciplines concerned with questions of ethnic identification.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Differentials in Idleness, Highest-Risk Idleness, and Dropping Out of High School
AN  - 868013734; 201113871
AB  - This research investigates three different indicators of at-risk socio-demographic conditions including dropping out of high school, being idle, and being in highest-risk idleness among non-immigrant persons aged 19-24. Using data from the 2000 US Census, our results detail the differentials in these characteristics for 30 different racial/ethnic groups that are further broken down by gender. The findings indicate a wide range in the prevalence of these at-risk socio-demographic conditions. Groups that tend to be the most at-risk in terms of these indicators include African Americans, Cambodians, Laotians, Native Americans, other Hispanic whites, and white Mexicans. With the exception of the other Pacific Islander and Thai, young women have lower high school dropout rates than do young men. However, young women are substantially more likely than young men to be idle which we define as not being in school, the labor force, or the military. After defining highest-risk idleness as never-married persons without children who are idle, however, the rates are slightly lower for young women than for young men.

T1  - Immigrant Participation in the Transnational Era: Latin Americans' Experiences with Collective Organising in Toronto
AN  - 743065902; 201043386
AB  - This paper examines the challenges migrant groups that are new and internally diverse face to participate and build community in host societies today. Qualitative research findings on Latin American migrants' experiences in Toronto, Canada, reveal that the group's participation is the result of a complexity of social and spatial processes. The paper contributes to current debates on the study of immigrant integration in three ways: (1) by focusing on immigrants' collective forms of organising, (2) by responding to ongoing calls for a closer examination of intra-group diversity, and (3) by drawing on transnationalism research to avoid the use of essentialising categories in the study of immigrant groups that are internally diverse.

T1  - Transnational family relationships, social networks and return migration among British-Caribbean young people
AN  - 743055561; 201043342
AB  - The study explores the issue of transnational family relationships and return migration among British-Caribbean second generation young people.1 It describes how transnational family ties and social networks are utilized as social capital resources to facilitate these young people's migration from Britain to the Caribbean, their parents' country of origin. A combination of internally formed and externally imposed understandings of ethnic identity, home and belonging are also important factors influencing these young people's decision to migrate to the Caribbean, alongside other pragmatic and practical reasons. Drawing on in-depth interviews with a qualitative sample of second generation return migrants residing in Jamaica, the discussion reflects on how these young people manage their adjustment and settlement. It also explores the gendered nature of their experiences of return migration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The specter haunting multiculturalism
AN  - 743065851; 201043199
AB  - I argue that the specter haunting multiculturalism is incommensurability. In many discussions of multiculturalism there is a 'picture' that holds us captive -- a picture of cultures, religious or ethnic groups that are self-contained and are radically incommensurable with each other. I explore and critique this concept of incommensurability. I trace the idea of incommensurability back to the discussion by Thomas Kuhn -- and especially to the ways in which his views were received. Drawing on Gadamer's understanding of hermeneutics, I argue that the very idea of radical incommensurability is incoherent. This does not entail an abstract universalism but rather sensitivity to the ways in which all languages and cultures are in principle open to the real possibility of enlarging one's vision and mutually understanding.

T1  - Black cultural advancement: racial identity and participation in the arts among the black middle class
AN  - 60339334; 201017377
AB  - While there are well developed theoretical elaborations of the role of consumption in establishing and solidifying the class boundaries of elites, there is less understanding of the ways that elites draw on cultural participation to assert racial and ethnic membership. I address this gap and explore how middle-class blacks experience art patronage as a collective project of black cultural advancement. Drawing on in-depth interviews with middle-class blacks, I document how some middle-class blacks see themselves as uplifting the race by being patrons of black artists and black cultural institutions and by owning black art. Through elaborating how middle-class blacks experience arts participation as a form of racial unity, this paper contributes to a more complete understanding of the role that cultural participation plays in the racial and ethnic identity construction of elites.
