T1  - Factors influencing HIV-risk perception among MSM students at a university in Durban, South Africa
AN  - 2581110432
AB  - Risk perception is embedded in attitudes and beliefs that determine how one ultimately behaves. In relation to HIV-risk behaviours, risk perception is a key dimension in most health behaviour models used to construct health promotion campaigns. This study aimed to understand HIV-risk perception and associated factors among men who have sex with men (MSM). The qualitative data used in this study came from 15 in-depth interviews with MSM studying at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. The findings show that MSM perceive themselves to be at risk for HIV due to their awareness of the main routes of infection. This perception exists because HIV has affected them through the loss of close family members. With each sexual encounter, risk perception changed based on factors such as the sexual role being assumed (insertive versus receptive), the socio-economic status of the partner, perceived level of discriminatory dating patterns, and the use of preventive measures. High levels of risk perception among the men did not translate into positive attitudes towards condoms as many of them preferred to have unprotected sex with trusted partners. Despite perceiving their risk of HIV infection to be high, MSM continue to engage in multiple sexual partnerships and high partner turnover. However, the men in this study were keen to protect their health; with time, they have developed more positive attitudes towards HIV and they understand that it is possible to protect oneself before and after infection.

T1  - The impact of symbolic boundaries on perceptions of relations between Japan and South Korea
AN  - 2494717354
AB  - This paper argues the perceptions of relations between two nations involve not only the institutionalized national-boundary but also the perspectives of multiple symbolic boundaries. Based on a qualitative study, this paper aims to explain how different symbolic boundaries impact Japanese experts’ perception of interrelations between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The paper includes an analysis of opinion surveys, 20 semi-structured interviews with experts, and three focus group interviews with university students of Peace Studies Departments conducted throughout June and July of 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. These results advance existing scholarship by showing that Japanese experts use the following four symbolic boundaries to comprehend relations between Japan and South Korea: boundaries between (1) victims and perpetrators; (2) ‘the West’ and the Asian cultural and political space; (3) nationalistic and peaceful countries; and (4) a state and people.

T1  - Exploring Inconsistencies in the Interpretation of Canada’s Section 161 Order for Sexual Offending
AN  - 2521461068
AB  - Community-based risk management strategies for people convicted of sexual offences (PCSO) can hinder successful reintegration, which plays an important role in reducing sexual recidivism. Section 161 of the Criminal Code is a Canadian risk management strategy, which aims to protect children by prohibiting people convicted of sexual offences against children (PCSO-C) from engaging in behaviours assumed (sometimes erroneously) to be associated with sexual offending. This study was the first to evaluate Section 161 prohibition orders. We explored inconsistencies in the interpretation and (hypothetical) application of these conditions between PCSO-C subject to Section 161 and two non-forensic subsamples of the Canadian public – community members and undergraduate students. Non-forensic participants expressed more negative attitudes towards the treatment of PCSO, which were found to mediate the relationship between group membership and subjective legal decision-making. Degree of support for Section 161 conditions did not appear to moderate this effect. Results raise concerns about the potential for increased personal discretion when enforcing or adhering to ambiguous or overly broad legal conditions. We suggest the need for continued efforts to establish an empirical understanding of the application, efficacy, and potential collateral consequences associated with this Canadian risk management strategy.Alternate abstract:
Les stratégies de gestion du risque dans la communauté pour les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles (PCIS) peuvent nuire à une réintégration réussie, ce qui joue un rôle important dans la réduction de récidive sexuelle. L’article 161 du Code criminel est une stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne, laquelle cherche à protéger les enfants en empêchant les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles contre les enfants (PCIS-E) d’avoir des comportements qui sont présumés (parfois de façon erronée) comme étant associés avec des infractions sexuelles. Cette étude a été la première à évaluer l’ordonnance d’interdiction de l’article 161 et à explorer les incohérences dans l’interprétation et l’exécution de ces conditions entre les PCIS-E contraints par l’article 161 et deux sous-échantillons non judiciaires du public canadien – des membres de la communauté et des étudiants de premier cycle. Les participants non judiciaires ont exprimé des attitudes plus négatives envers le traitement des PCIS, ce qui servait de médiateur entre l’appartenance au groupe et la prise de décision juridique subjective. Un certain soutien des conditions de l’article 161 conditions n’a pas semblé modérer cet effet. Les résultats soulèvent des inquiétudes en ce qui concerne le potentiel d’avoir une plus grande discrétion personnelle lors de la mise en application de conditions légales ambiguës et trop étendues. Nous suggérons que nous devons continuer nos efforts pour établir une compréhension empirique de la mise en application, de l’efficacité et des conséquences collatérales potentielles associées avec cette stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne.

T1  - Prejudice Against Gender and Sexual Diversity in Brazilian Public High Schools
AN  - 2421635755
AB  - This paper is the result of a research that evaluated the levels of prejudice against sexual and gender minorities within 28 Brazilian public schools. The research considered a sample of 413 teachers, 97 employees, and 1829 students from 28 public high schools, located in four Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Ceará, and Pernambuco. All of them answered a questionnaire on sociodemographic data, the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. The resulting analysis highlighted that religious individuals and followers of the Neo-Pentecostal church in the three study groups presented higher levels of prejudice than the other groups involved. All groups that have done previous training in the subject of prejudice presented inferior scores to those that had not done. Individuals that stated they have gay man, lesbian woman, travestis persons, or transsexual persons as friends, relatives, and acquaintances in the groups of teachers and students presented a lower level of prejudice compared to those who did not have relationships with people with these characteristics. Our results suggest the need for methodological changes in schools so that institutions can prepare their curriculum and their pedagogical practices considering the current multiple existing sexual and gender orientations.

T1  - Parental competitive victimhood and interethnic discrimination among their children: The mediating role of ethnic socialization and symbolic threat to the in‐group
AN  - 2331728867
AB  - Links between competitive victimhood and discrimination are well documented. However, the mechanisms how victimhood beliefs remain relevant for decades and how conflict survivors can shape attitudes and behaviours of the post‐conflict generations are little understood. Following the Transgenerational Transmission Hypothesis and the Integrated Threat Theory, we propose that the link between parental competitive victimhood and discrimination among their children is mediated through family ethnic socialization and symbolic threat to the in‐group. Participants were families that included youth (N = 227) and their parents (172 mothers, 150 fathers) in Vukovar, Croatia. A multiple group, chain mediation model was conducted with parental competitive victimhood as the predictor; youth ethnic socialization and symbolic threat as sequential mediators; and youth tendency to discriminate against the outgroup and perceived ethnic in‐group discrimination as outcomes. The findings revealed significant indirect effects of the competitive victimhood on both outcomes, via the proposed mediators. The only difference in the model between majority Croats and minority Serbs was the path from symbolic threat to tendency to discriminate, which was positive and significant for both groups, but stronger among Croats. The findings imply that interventions in post‐conflict settings need to address family ethnic socialization processes in addition to directly working with youth.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, and the American Criminal Justice System: The Perceptions and Experiences of West Indian Men
AN  - 2274303528
AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black–White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change.

T1  - Outsider Privileges Can Lead to Insider Disadvantages: Some Psychosocial Aspects of Ableism
AN  - 2295332055
AB  - People with disabilities are sometimes described as an invisible minority group, one that frequently encounters ableism in the course of daily life. Ableism entails biased ideas and assumptions, as well as prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory acts, aimed at people with disabilities. This article examines how and why ableism poses distinct social and psychological privileges for outsiders (the nondisabled) and resulting disadvantages for insiders (people with disabilities). Four theories accounting for outsiders’ ableism directed at insiders are presented: just world theory, mourning, suffering and meaning, and the fundamental negative bias. The consequences of ableism for people with disabilities are then discussed, including internalized ableism, deindividuation, stigmatization and stereotyping, and the problems posed by benign ableism. I argue that sometimes ableism represents a form of outsider privilege, one allowing nondisabled people to feel, think, and act in ways that often unknowingly promote their social and psychological interests over people with disabilities. I then conclude the article by calling for efforts to better educate nondisabled people regarding guidelines for constructively engaging people with disabilities as a matter of social policy.

T1  - Framing and counter-framing a Peace March in Russia: the use of Twitter during a hybrid war
AN  - 2249877979
AB  - Framing is vital to the capacity of social movements to enlist popular support and sustain contentious collective action. Using the case of a Peace March held in Moscow on 21 September 2014, the article examines how antiwar activists and their opponents framed a protest against Russia's intervention in Ukraine. The study argues that different interpretations of patriotism underpinned divergent evaluations of the conflict and the construction of opposing identities. An analysis of Twitter posts on the eve of the march shows that peace activists positioned themselves as citizens with high moral standards and a healthy dose of patriotism, criticized the Russian government for military intervention in Ukraine, and called for a peaceful conflict resolution. In turn, opponents of the march considered themselves as real patriots and their adversaries as national traitors, denied Russia's military presence in Ukraine, and fomented an attack on critics of Russian foreign policy. The study contributes to social movement literature by analyzing the framing of antiwar activism on a social media platform in the midst of a hybrid war, marked by a great deal of ambiguity and deception about causes, dynamics, and consequences of military operations by state and non-state actors.

T1  - When Sexism Leads to Racism: Threat, Protecting Women, and Racial Bias
AN  - 2024343845
AB  - The stated goal of protecting White women from harm has been used, historically and contemporarily, as a pretext for racial violence. Two studies explored the relationship between protective paternalism (the belief that men should protect and care for women—part of benevolent sexism; Glick and Fiske 1996) and anti-minority racial attitudes. In Study 1 (n = 474, 61% women, 61% White), survey data found that protective paternalism was related to anti-Black bias, but only for White respondents. Study 2 (n = 242, 52% women, 74% White) experimentally manipulated feelings of threat to test for increases in protective paternalism and its corresponding effect on three anti-minority racial attitudes. For male participants only, threat (i.e., reading about recent increases in violent crime) increased endorsement of protective paternalism, which was in turn associated with a more negative view of immigration, and, for White men only, less support for policies that benefit racial minority groups and greater denial of racial bias in policing. Threat did not increase protective paternalism in female participants. For White men in particular, news of crime and danger increases racial bias by first increasing the desire to protect women. Policymakers should be aware that framing policies around safety concerns or appealing to the protection of women might unintentionally bolster anti-minority racial prejudices.

T1  - Marriage and Social Boundaries among British Pakistanis
AN  - 2114224179
AB  - A cosmopolitan environment offers challenges for cultural groups that seek to reproduce themselves in the next generation. British Pakistanis have not seen the kind of breakdown in marriage boundaries that characterizes other post-war migrants to Britain. The article examines how this pattern is linked to commitments to transnational marriage, which promise a source of future remittances to Pakistan. However, the need to maintain these links has exaggerated the importance of religious and moral display for British Pakistanis, and these have wider effects in the policing of social contact with outsiders and the negative portrayal of the sexual morality of non-Pakistanis.

T1  - Unpacking Chinese America: The Political Participation of Taiwanese Americans in the Early Twenty-First-Century United States
AN  - 2157620365
AB  - Who are (or can count as) Taiwanese Americans? To what extent and in what ways do they participate politically in the United States? This study attempts to unpack the concept of Chineseness by examining various formations of identity boundaries of Taiwanese Americans. We empirically assess their “success” in political participation and incorporation by analyzing patterns of political participation of U.S. voting-age adults who were born in or originated from Taiwan, as compared to those who were born in or originated from (Mainland) China and Asia as a whole. We argue that Taiwanese Americans occupy a distinct space in modern Asian American history and a better understanding of the experiences of this often overlooked and misunderstood community can further explicate the complexity of being Chinese in contemporary America. However, we discuss multiple sets of methodological challenges in systematically studying the population through U.S. census survey and several other types of quantitative data. Whereas we find immigrants originated from Taiwan to be generally more active in electoral politics than those from Mainland China, our findings challenge the pluralist assumptions of a linear process of political incorporation and reject an overtly simplistic characterization of Taiwanese Americans as a “model-minority” success story.

T1  - Putting Ourselves in Another’s Skin: Using the Plasticity of Self-Perception to Enhance Empathy and Decrease Prejudice
AN  - 1965760747
AB  - The self is one the most important concepts in social cognition and plays a crucial role in determining questions such as which social groups we view ourselves as belonging to and how we relate to others. In the past decade, the self has also become an important topic within cognitive neuroscience with an explosion in the number of studies seeking to understand how different aspects of the self are represented within the brain. In this paper, we first outline the recent research on the neurocognitive basis of the self and highlight a key distinction between two forms of self-representation. The first is the “bodily” self, which is thought to be the basis of subjective experience and is grounded in the processing of sensorimotor signals. The second is the “conceptual” self, which develops through our interactions of other and is formed of a rich network of associative and semantic information. We then investigate how both the bodily and conceptual self are related to social cognition with an emphasis on how self-representations are involved in the processing and creation of prejudice. We then highlight new research demonstrating that the bodily and conceptual self are both malleable and that this malleability can be harnessed in order to achieve a reduction in social prejudice. In particular, we will outline strong evidence that modulating people’s perceptions of the bodily self can lead to changes in attitudes at the conceptual level. We will highlight a series of studies demonstrating that social attitudes towards various social out-groups (e.g. racial groups) can lead to a reduction in prejudice towards that group. Finally, we seek to place these findings in a broader social context by considering how innovations in virtual reality technology can allow experiences of taking on another’s identity are likely to become both more commonplace and more convincing in the future and the various opportunities and risks associated with using such technology to reduce prejudice.

T1  - Support for Beauty-Status Exchange Remains Illusory
AN  - 1941597048
AB  - In my article, "Beauty and Status: The Illusion of Exchange in Partner Selection?" (McClintock 2014), I used descriptive statistics, three forms of regression, and six measures of socioeconomic status to examine the "trophy wife" stereotype that women "exchange" their beauty for men's status. According to the stereotype, such women would partner with comparatively less-attractive men who are comparatively high in socioeconomic status. I found little support for beauty-status exchange, and this limited support lacked robustness. Gullickson critiques my analysis on two grounds, arguing against the difference-based regression models, and proposing a new specification of interaction effects in the log-linear models. However, the difference models conceptualize exchange as defined in the relevant literature, and Gullickson's modified difference models only replicate my conventional regression models, providing no new evidence for or against beauty-status exchange. Likewise, Gullickson's proposed log-linear specifications are not only non-hierarchical, they also fail to improve model fit or to support exchange when using alternative measures of status. Indeed, Gullickson focuses on the only measure of status that yields any support for beauty-status exchange. Altogether, Gullickson's case for beauty-status exchange overlooks the preponderance of contrary evidence and prioritizes statistical significance, attainable only under narrow model specifications, over robustness and model fit.

T1  - Complexity of Risk: Mixed-Methods Approach to Understanding Youth Risk and Insecurity in Postconflict Settings
AN  - 1978439864
AB  - In settings of intergroup conflict, identifying contextually relevant risk factors for youth development is an important task. In Vukovar, Croatia, a city devastated during the war in former Yugoslavia, ethno-political tensions remain. The current study utilized a mixed-methods approach to identify two salient community-level risk factors (ethnic tension and general antisocial behavior) and related emotional insecurity responses (ethnic and nonethnic insecurity) among youth in Vukovar. In Study 1, focus group discussions (N
 = 66) with mothers, fathers, and adolescents of age 11 to 15 years old were analyzed using the constant comparative method, revealing two types of risk and insecurity responses. In Study 2, youth (N
 = 227, 58% male, M
 = 15.88, SD
 = 1.12 years) responded to quantitative scales developed from the focus groups, discriminate validity was demonstrated, and path analyses established predictive validity between each type of risk and insecurity. First, community ethnic tension (i.e., threats related to war/ethnic identity) significantly predicted ethnic insecurity for all youth (β = .41, p
 < .001). Second, experience with community antisocial behavior (i.e., general crime found in any context) predicted nonethnic community insecurity for girls (β = .32, p
 < .05) but not for boys. These findings are the first to show multiple forms of emotional insecurity at the community level; implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Is structural stigma's effect on the mortality of sexual minorities robust? A failure to replicate the results of a published study
AN  - 1957229605
AB  - Background The study of stigma's influence on health has surged in recent years. Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) study of structural stigma's effect on mortality revealed an average of 12 years' shorter life expectancy for sexual minorities who resided in communities thought to exhibit high levels of anti-gay prejudice, using data from the 1988-2002 administrations of the US General Social Survey linked to mortality outcome data in the 2008 National Death Index. Methods In the original study, the key predictor variable (structural stigma) led to results suggesting the profound negative influence of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities. Attempts to replicate the study, in order to explore alternative hypotheses, repeatedly failed to generate the original study's key finding on structural stigma. Efforts to discern the source of the disparity in results revealed complications in the multiple imputation process for missing values of the components of structural stigma. This prompted efforts at replication using 10 different imputation approaches. Results Efforts to replicate Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) key finding on structural stigma's notable influence on the premature mortality of sexual minorities, including a more refined imputation strategy than described in the original study, failed. No data imputation approach yielded parameters that supported the original study's conclusions. Alternative hypotheses, which originally motivated the present study, revealed little new information. Conclusion Ten different approaches to multiple imputation of missing data yielded none in which the effect of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities was statistically significant. Minimally, the original study's structural stigma variable (and hence its key result) is so sensitive to subjective measurement decisions as to be rendered unreliable.

T1  - The role of race, ethnicity and tribal enrolment on asset accumulation: an examination of American Indian tribal nations
AN  - 1916702735
AB  - We analyse survey data from the National Asset Scorecard for Communities of Color Project for asset accumulation in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The survey oversampled the American Indian/Alaska Native population in order to examine asset accumulation among a variety of racial, ethnic and legal status groups. We examine differences in asset accumulation across tribal members from a variety of American Indian tribes. Additionally, we make comparisons across those that are tribally enrolled to those that are not tribally enrolled. We find substantial difference across tribal affiliation in our data once we disaggregate the category of American Indian. Our research adds a new dimension to the literature examining differences in wealth accumulation by race and political status for a little-studied group. Specifically, we examine the intersection of race and legal status in wealth and asset accumulation.

T1  - Perspectives and Experiences of DeafBlind College Students
AN  - 1929694236
AB  - DeafBlind individuals are resilient human beings who face significant and complex challenges in all aspects of life. Challenges include access to information, communication, academics, social activities, identity, independence, mobility, and moving around in the world. Recently, more DeafBlind students are attending higher education institutions. Therefore, this study focuses on discovering experiences and perspectives of DeafBlind college students who attend a bilingual and bicultural university for sighted Deaf students, where there are a limited number of DeafBlind students. Personal interviews and observations are used to explore how DeafBlind adults navigated college life and what coping strategies they used to overcome academic and social challenges. A grounded theory-based approach was used, as an analysis, as there is limited information and research available about DeafBlind college individuals. Insights and strategies are provided to support new DeafBlind students who plan to attend post-secondary education or are already attending college.

T1  - Queering Spirituality and Evolving Sexual Ethics
AN  - 1923057352
AB  - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (GLBTIQ) people from culturally diverse and religious backgrounds may sometimes feel that we must choose between keeping connected to our religious/ethnic communities while denying our gender-identities/expressions and sexuality, or connecting to a broader Australian GLBTIQ-community that is White/Anglo-dominant and normatively hostile to overt expressions of faith, religiosity and spiritual longing. In this paper, I explore working definitions of the terms 'spirituality', 'religion' and queer corollaries of spiritual community, paying particular attention to non-religious secular manifestations. I will argue that gender, sexual and political liberation within a multicultural society can and must accommodate both pluralist and integrative approaches to seemingly paradoxical ideas around secularism and religiosity. I will discuss my experiences as a cisgender gay Buddhist Malaysian-Chinese Australian man and my relationships with a group of Asian gay men from religiously diverse backgrounds as case examples, to explore possible frameworks for how these may be manifested and enacted.

T1  - The Coptic diaspora and the status of the Coptic minority in Egypt
AN  - 1884516402
AB  - This paper examines the political activity of the Coptic diaspora in the United States in support of the Coptic minority in Egypt. Analysing its strategy reveals that for years it has focused on lobbying the United States and international bodies, in order to raise international awareness of the Coptic minority status. By using this strategy, it has framed the struggle for Copts' rights in a manner that contradicts the Egyptian unity narrative, and the strategic choices of those they are struggling for. This paper shows that understanding the limitations of this strategy alongside a change in the structure of opportunities in Egypt has led to a change in the pattern of activity of the diaspora activists. Alongside lobbying for international involvement, they have developed additional strategies, including strengthening their influence in the homeland and even direct action vis-à-vis the Egyptian authorities. This paper, which emphasises the pattern of action of diaspora activists that represent minorities, directs attention to the structure of opportunities in the homeland, the variety of relationships between the diaspora and the homeland, and their effect on the ability of the diaspora activists to become a significant force in shaping the life of the minority.

T1  - Racial phenotypicality bias in educational expectations for both male and female teenagers from different socioeconomic backgrounds
AN  - 1928612896
AB  - In three experiments (N=56, 99, and 225), we showed that racial phenotypicality bias characterizes educational expectations for Chilean mestizo students: participants displayed more positive educational expectations for light complexioned than for dark complexioned high school students. In Study 1, with male high school target students, the relation between racial phenotypic appearance and educational expectations was mediated by differences in perceived competence. Study 2 suggests that the gender of the target student did not influence the occurrence of racial phenotypicality bias. Study 3 showed that racial phenotypicality bias occurs in both university students and high school teachers' judgements. Although socioeconomic background of the target student partially explained the effects of racial phenotypic appearance (especially in teachers), the latter exerted an additional and independent influence on educational expectations. These results underline the fact that effects of racial phenotypicality bias should not be overlooked in the educational domain. As mediational analyses suggested, these effects only partly occur because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and socioeconomic background, but also because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and attributed competence.

T1  - Multiculturalism and secularism: Theoretical understandings and possible conflicts
AN  - 1891652175
AB  - Multiculturalism in a European context increasingly has come to denote a concern with religious minorities. Claims for multicultural accommodation of minorities therefore potentially conflict with secularist requirements of separation of politics and religion. Whether there is a conflict depends on the general understandings of multiculturalism and secularism. The paper therefore distinguishes and examines different general understandings. Both multiculturalism and secularism can be understood as sets of policies, or as forms of minority accommodation or views about the relationship between religion and politics defined in relation to liberalism. Both understandings are problematic, so the paper proposes alternative formal understandings of multiculturalism and secularism. Multiculturalism denotes interpretations of what underlying (often liberal) principles imply under new circumstances of diversity. Secularism denotes what such principles imply for the relationship between politics and religion. Such formal understandings provide theoretical frameworks for specifying different conceptions of multiculturalism and secularism and for determining in precisely which respects conflicts might arise. But the frameworks also indicate that conflicts are not general or necessarily fundamental, and they provide tools for reinterpreting conceptions in ways that might avoid apparent conflicts.

T1  - Education and Employment among Muslims in Indian Jammu and Kashmir
AN  - 1892718886
AB  - Muslims constitute about 14% population of India and are the largest religious minority community spread over the length and breadth of the country. The minority community in question has been relegated to the lowest socio-economic stratum in Indian society especially after the partition and independence of the country. However, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Muslims are in majority constituting about 67% population of the state. In the current study, the Concentration Index of Muslim population, variation in literacy rate and work participation, occupational structure across region and religion, as well as the interrelationship between concentration of Muslim population, literacy rate and work participation in Jammu and Kashmir has been explored and explained. The present study is based upon secondary information obtained from Census 2001 and is also supplemented with government reports, published work wherever necessary. As far as share of Muslims in the sphere of education and employment in the state of Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, they have reported lower share among the population of literates, category of other workers and higher share in the occupational category of cultivators, agricultural labourers, household industry workers and non-workers in comparison to all religious groups. This means that despite being in majority, their situation is similar to their co-religionists at the all India level.

T1  - The Khachchara of Kathmandu - mobility, situatedness and ethnic identification
AN  - 1865592717
AB  - This paper investigates the role of mobility and settlement in reworking ethnic identification among the Khachchara in Kathmandu, Nepal. The Khachchara are a small group of around 350 families, the descendants of Tibetan mothers and Newar fathers, who predominantly worked and lived as traders in Tibet. After the Chinese occupation of Tibet, the Khachchara had the option of obtaining citizenship, yet many returned to Nepal with their spouses and children. On relocating to Nepal, caste considerations of purity came into play for the descendants of mixed marriages, forcing the Khachcharas to re-evaluate their ethnic identities as well as their place in Nepali society. Exploring Khachchara genesis through their history, mobility stories and their present hybrid affiliations shows how mobility disembeds identity and engages elective belonging. In this paper, the paradox of Khachchara ethnicity negotiating common ground in terms of their distinctiveness as a group, particularly through self-help organisations such as the skyid sdug (Tib.), and their assimilation into other ethnicities, is set in a discussion of translocal and transnational geographies, addressing both situatedness and de-territorialisation.

T1  - The last of the Li: ritual texts and shifting ethnicities in Hainan
AN  - 1855766642
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
On Hainan, it is commonly believed that people who identify themselves as Han employ ritual masters (commonly known as daogong [...]) who use texts, while those who view themselves as Li employ the service of geba (no applicable Chinese characters) who do not. This paper argues that the use of Chinese ritual texts implies that the specialist possessing them belongs to a larger religious movement, while those specialists without texts emphasize their own powers as well as those of the masters who instructed them. At the same time, however, my historical and field research indicates that the use of texts has been spreading throughout the Five Finger Mountain region throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, thereby prompting significant changes towards hybrid rituals and the denial of any Li connection. While the ethnic differentiation (minzu shibie [...]) campaigns beginning in the 1950s have promoted a sense of ethnic identity, the growing use of written texts indicates that Li ritual practices have been converging with those of the Han.

T1  - New Trends and Patterns in Western European Immigration to the United States
AN  - 1851935363
AB  - This study explores the latest changes in Western European immigration to the United States by integrating several large databases: the U.S. census, the American Community Surveys, the European Social Survey, as well as the Human Development Index and Gini index. Findings show that the number of individuals born in Western Europe but with family origins elsewhere who have been immigrating to and settling in the United States is increasing. I divide the Western European population that immigrates to the United States into seven different subpopulations by their ancestries and explore the characteristics of these populations before and after immigrating to the United States. I also examine their relative success in terms of economic and labor outcomes in America, finding, for example, that some of the least advantaged immigrant groups have some of the best economic outcomes in the United States. The different self-selection and assimilation patterns among these immigrants have implications for U.S. public policy, which we identify and begin to explore.

T1  - Black Immigrants, Perceptions of Difference, and the Abiding Sting of Blackness
AN  - 1863555884
AB  - The Census Bureau's decision to allow Americans to claim whatever and as many racial and ethnic identities as they wish as of the 2000 Census was a watershed moment in American history' The decision marked official recognition of the society's ongoing racial and ethnic diversification. Yet it also revealed Americans' commitment to the traditional identity categories embedded in, as historian David Hollinger put it, the "ethno-racial pentagon" since only 2.4 percent of respondents claimed a multi-racial identity. Here, Vickerman focuses on the problematic black incorporation question, especially as raised by the Johnson article, arguing that, despite uncertainty, the continuing significance of race in American society renders certain outcomes more likely than others for black immigrants.

T1  - 'PRIMITIVE, CRUEL AND BLOOD-THIRSTY SAVAGES': STEREOTYPES IN AND ABOUT THE WESTERN BALKANS 1
AN  - 1841723051
AB  - This paper focuses on national stereotypes in the area of former Yugoslavia used by members of one ethnic community to describe members of other ethnic communities. The countries in the Balkans have a long history of ethnic fragmentation so it is no surprise that its ethnic groups are often stereotyped based on Western perceptions of the Balkans and the relationship between oppressors and the oppressed, which led to the development of stereotypes. The theoretical framework of stereotypes and prejudices and research on these topics show that stereotypes in former Yugoslavia have developed in relation to socio-political circumstances and that the stereotypes have been used for a long time, even after the potential reasons for their initial application ceased to exist.

T1  - Institutional Governance of Minority Religious Practices: Insights from a Study of Muslim Practices in Danish Schools
AN  - 1784152064
AB  - An increasing number of studies are concerned with the ways in which the religious practices of Europe's minority populations are accommodated on the political, national and local levels. In this article, I present a case study of Muslim practices in Danish schools. The study is an investigation of how and why six selected practices are governed in Danish schools: halal food, fasting, prayer, head scarves, holidays and mosques. The results underline the importance of the specific practice in question for the way in which it is governed: some practices are easily accommodated, while others are rejected outright by the schools. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how governance of Muslim practices is developed in the absence of national regulation and against the prevailing ideals in the Danish public debate. In fact, the governance developed seems to be a direct response to the number of Muslim children in school and in line with general school ideals of inclusion. However, the results also indicate that more direct involvement by local or national authorities might push schools to be more exclusive with regard to Muslim practices.

T1  - The Siren's Call? Exploring the Implications of an Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights on National Minorities
AN  - 1855325508
AB  - Calls for the adoption of an Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on National Minorities have persisted within the Council of Europe despite the adoption of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM). This article explores the potential implications of the adoption of an Additional Protocol on National Minorities to the ECHR for the FCNM. The European Court of Human Rights (ECTHR) already has several tools that would allow it to extend protection to persons belonging to national minorities. However, as the ECTHR tends to allow States a wide margin of appreciation in cases concerning persons belonging to minorities, it is argued that the adoption of an Additional Protocol on National Minorities may not be desirable, as it has the potential to undermine the progress made by the Framework Convention Advisory Committee.

T1  - Ethnicity and international security in the Far East from the perspective of national security
AN  - 1784139473
AB  - Ethnicity in the modern world impacts national domestic politics besides forming puzzles for the international environment. Simplifying ethnicity may result in obvious blunders, particularly regarding political issues. For instance, examining the ethno-political factor leads to the assumption that rioting ethnicity threatens both domestic and international securities, with ethnic conflicts having a powerful destructive potential. Amidst the global trends, ethnic processes are converting into a trigger of the contemporary international relations. This article aims to study the role of ethnicity as significant non-governmental actors from the perspective of national security in the Far East. The objectives of the study include researching contemporary security issues in Northeast Asia as well as novel possibilities for Russia in the process of the formation of the structures of security in Northeast Asia. The main aspect of the paper is to describe the ethnosystems of the Far East (the cases of Koreans, Tungus and Nanai) as independent coherent phenomena. It is important to show that international security is the major psychomental complex of the national system and via what mechanism this drive for international security may force adaptation by the ethnosystem. It is important to provide a concrete example of an ethnic process adapting to international security as an external pressure imposed externally. Methodology: This paper is based on the results of previous researches and findings, including the data containing information about the ethnopolitical situation in Northeast Asia as well as the interrelations among the neighbouring states and referred to the system analysis and the interdisciplinary approach.

T1  - Everyday and Cosmo-Multiculturalisms: Doing Diversity in Gentrifying School Communities
AN  - 1784151417
AB  - Gentrification is transforming the class and ethnic profile of urban communities across the world, and changing how people deal with social and cultural difference. This paper looks at some of the social consequences of gentrification in Sydney, Australia, focusing on local schools. It argues that in this urban Australian context, the influx of middle-class Anglo-Australians into traditionally working-class, migrant-dominated areas is significantly changing how people relate to each other within local schools, often fragmenting and dividing school communities. These shifts are intensified by the public policy of school choice, which has enabled some parents to bypass their local school for a more 'desirable' one. This paper presents a close local study of two schools within one gentrifying Sydney suburb, examining how the schools have become more polarised. In particular, we examine how this demographic polarisation has given rise to two distinct modes of 'doing diversity', namely, 'everyday' and 'cosmo-multiculturalisms'. While the former is about daily, normalised encounters across difference, the latter is a form of multiculturalism based on strategic and learned 'appreciation' and consumption of difference, characteristic of gentrified communities.

T1  - "MARKING WHITENESS" FOR CROSS-RACIAL SOLIDARITY
AN  - 1733239733
AB  - The dramatic difference in typical Black and White lifeworlds--or sets of "cultural givens" assumed by Black and White Americans and used to interpret experience--impedes the development of a cross-racial solidarity oriented toward racial justice. If such a cross-racial solidarity is to be realized, actors must reorient the average White lifeworld in ways that make Whites more receptive to Black claims. I identify, theorize, and assess a particular strategy for transforming the dominant White lifeworld, and thus facilitating cross-racial solidarity, that directly confronts contemporary Whiteness: "marking Whiteness." The idea of "marking Whiteness" is abstracted from three different texts--the blog-turned-book Stuff White People Like, a satiric essay entitled "I Am a Martyr (And So Can You!): A Guide to White Male Victimhood" published in Esquire magazine, and the sketch comedy phenomenon Chappelle's Show. Interventions that "mark Whiteness" make Whiteness hyper-visible--as is characteristic of "marked" groups--and portray average White behavior and ideas as integral to the systemic reproduction of racial injustice. "Marking Whiteness" renders the racial polity visible, and makes contemporary Whites' complicity in racial injustice undeniable. While there are good reasons to be skeptical of the progressive credentials of any mass cultural product and popular texts are often subject to misinterpretation, popular culture should be recognized as an important site in lifeworld and solidarity construction and reconstruction.

T1  - Explicit and Hidden Racial Bias in the Framing of Social Problems
AN  - 1728660651; 201534081
AB  - Many contested issues in the American public and political spheres are rooted in fundamentally differing views of the scope, causes, and consequences of social problems. This is certainly true for two major interrelated social problems with racial implications: crime and labor market inequalities. In the era since the civil rights movement made the open expression of racial bias less socially acceptable, however, public and political discussions of social problems with racial implications are often framed in purportedly race-neutral ways (Bonilla-Silva 2010; Schuman et al. 1997). Drawing on group position (Blumer 1958) and collective action framing (Benford and Snow 2000) perspectives and employing the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, the present work suggests an enduring influence of racial bias on the ways people understand these major social problems. In contrast to earlier eras, however, much of the contemporary role of racial bias is hidden. The current work employs an implicit measure of racial bias that is resistant to a social desirability bias (Payne et al. 2005) to reveal a more complete picture of the influence of racial bias on the way people perceive social problems - even among those who explicitly deny possessing such biases. Specifically, this work reveals roles for both explicit and implicit racial bias in the way non-Hispanic whites identify the severity of problems, attribute blame for problems, and are motivated to concern around particular issues.

T1  - Group Position, Threat, and Immigration
AN  - 2406941859
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to move research on racial attitudes away from studying intraindividual attitudes toward studying broader structural factors that contribute to the attitudes and feelings of U.S. citizens. We focus on how interest groups and elite actors play a role in shaping the discourse on immigrants and the immigration debate in the twenty-first century. Herbert Blumer posed that over time, the dominant group develops certain feelings toward subordinate group members and that these feelings form the basis of racial prejudice. These feelings include notions of superiority, the alienation of other groups, proprietary claims over valued resources, and finally, a feeling that resources are threatened. While not dismissing the importance of interpersonal interactions, Blumer posed that elite entities within the dominant group play prominent roles in producing and managing these feelings among the masses because they have access to the public ear. To assess how the elite attempt to manage feelings toward immigration, we use qualitative data from 33 amicus briefs submitted in support of Arizona’s SB 1070 law in the Arizona v. United States case. Findings reveal that each of the feelings was prominently represented in all briefs, which supports the notion that elite entities use arguments that promote feelings Blumer associated with racial prejudice.

T1  - Racial Differences in Self-Reports of Short Sleep Duration in an Urban-Dwelling Environment
AN  - 1761675321; 201602190
AB  - Objectives. To explore whether there are differences in sleep duration between blacks and whites residing in similar urban neighborhoods and examine whether the relationship between sleep durations and sociodemographic and/or health indices are consistent for blacks and whites. Methods. A total of 1,207 participants from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Disparities across the Life Span study (age: mean = 47, standard deviation = 8.74). Sleep duration was assessed by a self-report of hours of nightly sleep in the past month. Sociodemographic measures included age, sex, education, poverty status, and perceived neighborhood disorder. Health status was assessed using measures of vigilance, depression, perceived stress, coronary artery disease, diabetes, blood pressure, and inflammation. Results. There were no significant racial group differences in sleep duration. Whites, however, were more likely than blacks to report sleep durations of 7hr with increasing stress and education levels. Blacks were more likely than whites to report short sleep durations (i.e., 6-7hr vs. >7hr of sleep) with increasing inflammation levels. Discussion. Although racial disparities in sleep duration are minimized when the environment is equivalent between blacks and whites, the underlying demographic and health explanations for short sleep durations may vary between whites and blacks.

T1  - Untangling the gender gap in symbolic racist attitudes among white Americans
AN  - 2571040583
AB  - While the gender gap in voting has important political implications for understanding contemporary American politics, and continues to be a focus of a great deal of research, gender gaps in policy areas have also been identified and these gender gaps also have dramatic political implications, particularly in the context of understanding attitudes about race. Despite the advances in our understanding of the gender gap in voting, fewer investigations have explored potential gender differences in racial attitudes. The lack of research into racial attitudes among women and men is surprising in light of the election and re-election of President Obama and the continued “racialization” of many national political issues. In fact, few studies have explored contemporary differences between women and men in levels of symbolic racism. Moreover, among the existing studies of possible gender gaps in racial attitudes, the role of perceived discrimination is surprisingly absent. In this investigation, potential differences between men and women in racial attitudes, specifically symbolic racism, are explored with a focus on demographic, attitudinal, and perceptions of discrimination as possible explanations. Results from a nationally representative survey demonstrate a significant gender gap in symbolic racism with women expressing less racially resentful attitudes. Furthermore, this gender gap in racial attitudes appears to be explained largely by ideology, party identification, and differences between men and women in their perceived experiences with discrimination.

T1  - Social Capital and Mental Health among Brazilian Immigrants in Japan
AN  - 1700676271; 201525322
AB  - This study investigates the effect of social capital on the psychological well-being of Brazilian immigrants in Japan. Social capital in immigrants has drawn considerable attention from sociologists and other social scientists because many advanced countries have accepted a large number of immigrants from other countries. Previous studies of immigration in the US have emphasized the important role of bonding social capital with family and co-ethnic friends in helping immigrants obtain social and emotional support from others. Conversely, other studies of immigration in European countries have suggested that bonding social capital with co-ethnic members does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. These contrasting findings demonstrate that social capital is largely embedded in the institutional settings within which immigrants deploy it. In this study, we explored how the psychological well-being of Brazilian immigrants in Japan depended on different forms of social capital. The results indicate that despite the lack of economic resources in their ethnic communities, Brazilian immigrants benefited significantly from bonding social capital with their extended families in terms of improved mental health. This study suggests that the effectiveness of bonding social capital substantially differs in terms of the objective and subjective realities of immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cossacks and Indians? Métissage in Action
AN  - 1749279459
AB  - In 1914 a sojourner in Winnipeg commented on the city's "Ukrainian Indians" to underline its seeming lack of European sophistication. Some decades later, however, that pejorative connotation was no longer operational: the notion of a "Ukrainian Indian" living in Canada was now something to be celebrated. This dramatic turnabout came with the release in 2012 of a blockbuster "bio-pic" produced in Ukraine. The film ("Fire Crosser") depicts the career of a Soviet Ukrainian hero-fighter pilot, allegedly killed in action during World War Two, but discovered years later alive and well as the Ukrainian-speaking chief of a band of Iroquois not far from Montreal. The decades that separated these two polarities offered many opportunities for ethno-cultural interaction, primarily on the Prairies where the harsh realities of pioneering forced Ukrainian settlers to borrow survival techniques from nearby Aborigines, who were invariably highly attuned to the vicissitudes of the very wilderness that the Ukrainians had come to conquer. Life stories from this initial period of Ukrainian settlement generally describe such early encounters as positive, amiable experiences. A rare exception is the deadly skirmish imagined by the Canadian poet Yar Slavutych. In some instances, however, their proximity to Ukrainian settlements worked against the Aborigines, who unwittingly became convenient scapegoats for criminal acts and missing children. After World War Two, with the "success" of Canada's Ukrainian pioneering experience firmly acknowledged, a new factor surfaced: a Ukrainian empathy for the perceived stagnation and plight of Canada's Aborigines. In actuality, this awareness had been initiated earlier by sojourning writers from Soviet Ukraine; their stories in Ukrainian dramatized the tragic fate of Canada's downtrodden Aboriginal peoples.

T1  - The Ukrainian Canadian Chaplaincy during World War Two
AN  - 1749279365
AB  - This paper discusses the creation, development, and significance of the office of Ukrainian chaplaincy in the Canadian military forces during World War II. Seven Ukrainian chaplains—three from the Ukrainian Catholic Church of Canada and four from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada—served the approximately 32,000–35,000 military personnel. Of these, three chaplains served in England and two in Europe. The work of the chaplains is discussed as is the role of their superiors in Canada and abroad. The paper evaluates the significance of the Ukrainian chaplaincy in the military effort, as well as in the development of the post-WWII Ukrainian Canadian community.Alternate abstract:Cet article présente la création, le développement et l’importance du bureau de l’aumônerie ukrainienne dans les forces militaires canadiennes pendant la seconde guerre mondiale.

Parmi eux, trois ont servi en Angleterre et deux sur le continent européen. Nous étudions ici le travail de ces aumôniers, ainsi que le rôle de leurs supérieurs au Canada et outremer. Nous y évaluons aussi l’importance du rôle de l’aumônerie ukrainienne dans l’effort militaire, ainsi que dans le développement de la communauté canadienne ukrainienne d’après la seconde guerre mondiale.

T1  - The Ukrainian Cultural Landscape in Canada and Brazil: A Century of Change and Divergence
AN  - 1749278071
AB  - Between 1891 and 1914 thousands of Ukrainian peasants left their ancestral homeland in Western Ukraine to seek land on the agricultural frontiers of Western Canada and southern Brazil. Often these emigrants who left for radically different frontiers originated from the same districts and villages; some even came from the same families. The new landscapes created in Canada and Brazil by these Ukrainian pioneers reflected environmental differences between the Old World and the New. The Ukrainian landscape in Brazil showed the most immediate response to environmental change, but the isolation of the Brazilian communities meant that evidence of traditional folkways and aspects of material culture survived far longer in Ukrainian Brazilian areas than in Ukrainian Canadian communities. At the same time as these landscapes in the Ukrainian diaspora were evolving, the landscapes of the hearth area were also experiencing change. This paper is thus an attempt to consider the role of time, environmental change, and culture in three areas that are geographically widely separated, but retain certain cultural commonalities in radically different physical and political environments.

T1  - Minority Representation and Order Maintenance Policing: Toward a Contingent View
AN  - 1667952472; 201509625
AB  - Objective This article's aim is to test the impact of black political and bureaucratic representation on the rate at which blacks are arrested for order maintenance violations in U.S. cities. Methods Using data from the Law Enforcement Management and Administration Survey, the Census Bureau, and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, for all U.S. cities over 100,000 population, the article first documents the continuing influence of black elected officials in promoting black representation on police forces. After establishing the appropriateness of order maintenance policing as a follow-up focus, the article then tests hypotheses that link variation in the rate of black order maintenance arrests to black political and bureaucratic representation, contingent upon form of government. Results Black political representation does constrain black order maintenance arrests, while black representation on the police force does not. Conclusion Even with a more racially representative police force in place, black political representation is what matters in constraining controversial patterns of police practice.

T1  - Reflecting on Heterosexual and Male Privilege: Interventions to Raise Awareness
AN  - 1634405107
AB  - Gender-focused college courses seek to increase understanding of the systematic advantages associated with dominant group membership. These courses attempt to reduce prejudice and raise awareness of male and heterosexual privilege. Inclusion of privilege content within gender-focused courses has increased, but research to test interventions to increase privilege awareness and reduce prejudice remains sparse. The current studies provide experimental information about awareness of heterosexual privilege (Study 1) and male privilege (Study 2) and specific interventions for use in education, professional development, and community settings. Study 1 found the video intervention was effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Study 2 found that male privilege awareness was significantly increased and modern sexism was reduced by the video intervention. Findings provide information for applied practices such as pedagogical strategies when designing diversity courses and training workshops.

T1  - The Invisible Second Generation? Statistical Discrimination and Immigrant Stereotypes in Employment Processes in Norway
AN  - 1667952360; 201509576
AB  - Although children of immigrants usually have acquired fluency in the majority language as well as domestic educational qualifications and work experience, recent quantitative and experimental studies indicate that the 'second generation' experiences discrimination in accessing entry-level jobs in Europe. In this article, I take as my point of departure a field experiment documenting that descendants of Pakistani immigrants indeed face discrimination in the Norwegian labour market, and use data from in-depth interviews with 42 of the employers subjected to research in the experiment to explore the decision-making processes leading to the disadvantages observed. The qualitative material suggests that stereotypes associated with immigrants are inferred from ethnically distinct names by employers, and that negative experiences are generalised between ethnic groups and across generations. The implications for the employment opportunities of children of immigrants are potentially severe. Instead of experiencing equal access to the labour market, they encounter attitudes and stereotypes attached to their parents' generation, making their domestic educational qualifications and linguistic fluency 'invisible' in the eyes of employers.

T1  - Inequality in the United States and Germany: Facts, Interpretations, and Blind Spots
AN  - 1667952741; 201509547
AB  - In the past few years, there has been renewed attention paid to issues of inequality in the Atlantic. Relatively, high inequality has been an important topic of discussion in the US for a long time. Apart from analysis of inequality between race groups (which in the US is closely linked to a history of slavery and the subsequent segregation and disenfranchisement of African-Americans), much of the focus of debates on inequality have focused on income inequality. On many fronts, the inequality situation in Germany is more favorable than in the US. Income inequality is markedly lower in Germany than in the US, although it has also risen substantially. Different beliefs on both sides of Atlantic about the facts on inequality and mobility may play a role. Politics seem to play an important role, too. Both factors have generally reduced state intervention to address inequality. In a much more consensus-oriented Germany, centrist governments have felt the need to address equity issues much more forcefully. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Managing diversity: How leaders' multiculturalism and colorblindness affect work group functioning
AN  - 1700674229; 201524898
AB  - Workforces are becoming increasingly diverse and leaders face the challenge of managing their groups to minimize costs and maximize benefits of diversity. This paper investigates how leaders' multiculturalism and colorblindness affect cultural minority and majority members' experiences of connectedness (feeling accepted or distancing from group) and relationship conflict in their group. We collected data from 29 culturally diverse student work groups and their leaders. We used repeated measures (baseline and follow-up) of group functioning and independent measures of members' and leaders' diversity perspectives. Multilevel analyses revealed that leaders' diversity perspectives affect work group functioning, controlled for members' own perspectives: Leaders' multiculturalism predicted feeling accepted in the group for minority members. In contrast, leaders' colorblindness predicted distancing from the group and relationship conflict for minority members. There were no significant effects of leaders' diversity perspective on majority members and no reverse effects of prior group functioning on leaders' diversity perspectives.

T1  - The temporal variation of ethnic segregation in a city: Evidence from a mobile phone use dataset
AN  - 1559006723; 201432020
AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the temporal variation of ethnic segregation in the city of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. We employ data on mobile-phone use to compare variations in segregation indices during the day, the week, and the year. The results indicate that the locations of people are more segregated at night, with considerably less segregation during the daytime. The segregation is significantly lower on workdays compared to weekends. Segregation is also lower during summer holidays compared to the winter working period. The results show that although places of residence are segregated, different ethnic groups use the city together during the day, which increases the potential for interethnic contacts. The results demonstrate also that temporal segregation indices based on mobile-phone use are considerably lower than segregation indices of places of residence that are derived from the census.

T1  - A toolkit for accessible and respectful engagement in research
AN  - 1692290273; 201521385
AB  - Social, scientific, and ethical factors underscore the value of respectfully including people with intellectual/developmental disabilities in research despite significant barriers to their research participation. In pursuit of this goal, we worked with two research advisors with intellectual/developmental disabilities to develop a qualitative study toolkit emphasizing accessibility, flexibility, variety, and responsiveness. The toolkit includes procedures and materials for recruitment, consent, interview locations and questions, breaks, and incentives. We recommend that future research utilizes insights of individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities in research that impacts their lives, and that researchers systematically improve the use of procedures and toolkits.

T1  - Multicultural desires? Parental negotiation of multiculture and difference in choosing secondary schools for their children
AN  - 1650147669; 201502144
AB  - This paper considers the ways in which parents talk about choosing secondary schools in three areas of Greater Manchester. It argues that this can be a moment when parents are considering their own attitudes to, and shaping their children's experiences of, multiculture. Multiculture is taken as the everyday experience of living with difference. The paper argues that multiculture needs to be understood as shaped not only by racialized, ethnic or religious difference (as it is commonly understood) but also by other differences which parents may consider important, particularly class and approaches to parenting. We stress the need to examine what parents say about schooling in the context in which they are talking, which is shaped by local areas and the experiences of their children in primary schools. Based on interviews with an ethnically mixed groups of parents from different schools, we show how perceptions of the racialized and class demographics of schools can influence parents' choice of secondary schools. The paper also argues that attention needs to be paid to the ways in which terms such as 'multicultural' and 'mix' are applied uniformly to very different contexts, be they particular schools or local areas, suggesting there is a paucity of language in Britain when talking about multiculture.

T1  - Mexican Americans as a paradigm for contemporary intra-group heterogeneity
AN  - 1520336414; 201412857
AB  - Racialization and assimilation offer alternative perspectives on the position of immigrant-origin populations in American society. We question the adequacy of either perspective alone in the early twenty-first century, taking Mexican Americans as our case in point. Re-analysing the child sample of the Mexican American Study Project, we uncover substantial heterogeneity marked by vulnerability to racialization at one end but proximity to the mainstream at the other. This heterogeneity reflects important variations in how education, intermarriage, mixed ancestry and geographic mobility have intersected for Mexican immigrants and their descendants over the twentieth century, and in turn shaped their ethnic identity. Finally, based on US census findings, we give reason to think that internal heterogeneity is increasing in the twenty-first century. Together, these findings suggest that future studies of immigrant adaptation in America must do a better job of accounting for heterogeneity, not just between but also within immigrant-origin populations.

T1  - Maintaining Hierarchies in Predominantly White Organizations: A Theory of Racial Tasks
AN  - 1512220991; 201408920
AB  - Predominantly White workplaces are environments in which Whiteness is privileged in numerous ways. Studies show workers of color doing self-presentation, emotion work, and other forms of social interaction intended to help ease the difficulties associated with being in the minority. In addition to the expectation that they smooth interactions with White peers, workers of color are assigned positions and tasks which reinforce that racial status quo. In this theoretical article, we attempt to place these various processes under an umbrella term we define as 'racial tasks.' We examine the ideological, interactional, and physical labor racial minorities perform in mostly White work settings, and the ways these racial tasks vary at different levels of the organizational structure. We consider the ways that the tactics and requirements associated with racial tasks maintain the racial hierarchy of predominantly White organizations and conclude by examining the implications of this work for racial minorities.

T1  - LIFE IN DUALITY: BIRACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT
AN  - 1767329278; 201606113
AB  - Biracial college students are an often overlooked student population in literature relating to college students, indicating the need to further explore their experiences and development throughout higher education. Their unique positions in society may afford them privileges that many minorities are not privy to while simultaneously disqualifying them from advantages associated with mono-racial Americans. Exploring how these students make sense of and navigate their higher education surroundings serves as the foundation for this research. Many biracial college students live in duality, understanding both their Black identity coupled with their White identity. This may present a challenge for some biracial students in higher education, given that the collegiate years are a prime time for self-discovery and identity development. This article will discuss historical perspectives that may speak to the position of biracial college students, explore the current literature on biracial identify development, and seek to understand the perspectives of a biracial college student at a predominately White institution in the south.

T1  - Reducing Prejudice with (Elaborated) Imagined and Physical Intergroup Contact Interventions
AN  - 1748865626; 201600132
AB  - We evaluated whether elaborated imagined contact (EIC) and physical contact interactions reduced prejudice. British community adults (n=42) participated in two sessions at least one week apart. Participants exposed to an EIC intervention in the first session, and a physical contact intervention in the second session, reported increased favorable intergroup attitudes across sessions. Participants exposed to physical contact interventions in both sessions failed to show changes in intergroup attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - IMPACT OF SELF-CONSTRUAL ON CHOICE OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL MEDIA FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARING
AN  - 1622297808; 201438278
AB  - Researchers have rarely focused on organizations choosing the right knowledge-sharing media according to users' individual-level variables such as self-construal. In this paper, the authors investigated the impact of self-construal (independent vs. interdependent) and organizational relationship (ingroup vs. outgroup) on employees' motivation, self-efficacy, and openness of sharing through two widely adopted online knowledge-sharing social media: Wikipedia and a question and answer (Q&A) archive. Quantitative responses to 4 scenarios were collected from 232 Chinese employees. The results indicated that when sharing with outgroup members, interdependent employees (but not independent employees) had higher self-efficacy and openness of sharing using Wikipedia than using Q&A. No difference between the two social media was found in the ingroup sharing. Theoretical implications and implications for practicing managers are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Dogla politics? Questioning ethnic consociationalism in Suriname's national elections of 25 May 2010
AN  - 1512220209; 201408849
AB  - This paper asks to what extent Suriname's consociational democracy still rests on its historically shaped meta-ideology of ethnic essentialism. Based on ethnographic data of the country's national elections in 2010, I suggest that the 'ethnic taboo' of ethnic mobilization by politicians was present to a certain extent. However, this taboo was challenged by the nationalist turn of Desi Bouterse's National Democratic Party. Furthermore, when considering voting behaviour and that of ethnically mixed Doglas in particular, we see that Surinamese politics is more complex. I will argue that while we have been thinking about Surinamese politics as being on a par with ethnic groupings, these 2010 elections were not simply about ethnicity. Ethnicity may have informed but did not fully explain people's political choices, because people are too complex to be captured in an exclusively ethnic category, and because the Surinamese political system is too complex to maintain clear ethnic categories.

T1  - Incorporation beyond identity: co-ethnic immigrants in Serbia
AN  - 1520341445; 201413035
AB  - In contrast to studies that examine cases of immigrant incorporation where the newcomers differ culturally from the established residents, this study controls for the ethnic identity of immigrants by considering the case of former refugees in Serbia who fled violent conflicts in the early 1990s. It also disaggregates the incorporation concept into three dimensions -- social, political and economic. Based on the original survey of 1,200 respondents, this article shows that the three dimensions of incorporation do not move in unison. Immigrants incorporate economically and politically to a greater degree in neighbourhoods where the proportion of immigrants is larger, while they incorporate socially to a lesser degree in those same neighbourhoods, as evident in the tendency to form interpersonal networks consisting mainly of other immigrants.

T1  - Cultivating a Symbolic Ethnicity and Resisting Assimilation: Identity Work Among Hungarian Immigrants
AN  - 1684426143; 201518490
AB  - Upon arrival in a host country with considerable ethnic diversity, such as the United States, immigrants are frequently confronted with various different perceptions of local, ethnic, and racial categories and identities. Living in the United States often challenges immigrants to reconsider, modify, or reconstruct their previous identities. This has happened, for example, to Eastern and Southern European immigrants in the late 1800s and early 1900s (Brodkin 1998; Conzen et al. 1992; Jacobson 1999; Goldstein 2006; Guglielmo 2003; Ignatiev 1995; Roediger 2006; Ungar 1998), and more recently to Korean, Filipino (Espiritu 2003), Mexican (Portes and Rumbaut 2006; Yinger 1981), Khmer (Hein 2006), and African immigrants from Ghana and Cape Verde (Kaufert 1977; Sanchez Gibau 2005), who all have had to reinterpret their identities upon arrival in the United States. Many new immigrants start thinking about themselves in ethnic terms for the first time and (re)discover their ethnicity. Through 20 in-depth interviews with Hungarian immigrants this study explores ethnic identity construction among Hungarians in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Out-group trust, intergroup anxiety, and out-group attitude as mediators of the effect of imagined intergroup contact on intergroup behavioral tendencies
AN  - 1433108353
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an out-group member would change behavioral tendencies toward the out-group. In Experiment 1, British high school students who imagined talking to an asylum seeker reported a stronger tendency to approach asylum seekers than did participants in a control condition. Path analysis revealed this relationship was mediated by out-group trust and, marginally, by out-group attitude. In Experiment 2, straight undergraduates who imagined an interaction with a gay individual reported a stronger tendency to approach, and a weaker tendency to avoid, gay people. Path analyses showed that these relationships were mediated by out-group trust, out-group attitude, and less intergroup anxiety. These findings highlight the potential practical importance of imagined contact and important mediators of its effects.

T1  - Internal media, conceptual metaphors and minority cultural identities
AN  - 1448998063; 201342970
AB  - In recent times we have witnessed a growth in the number of groups who are calling for cultural recognition on the basis of a putative discrete ethnicity. In this article we examine one such group, the 'Ulster-Scots' in Northern Ireland. We examine how this group metaphorically conceptualize their identity within their internal press media output, specifically the monthly publication The Ulster-Scot. Drawing on the conceptual metaphor approach of Lakoff and Johnson, which argues that metaphors are central to how we define and understand our everyday world, we examine the discursive construction of an Ulster-Scots collective identity and history through an analysis of the metaphors employed. We argue that a focus on the use of conceptual metaphors within discourses of ethnicity provides a valuable insight into ethnic self-understanding at a given point in time, and that, consequently, this approach is a valuable addition to the analytic repertoire for researchers concerned with issues of emergent ethnicity and the construction ethnic identities in general.

T1  - Exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media
AN  - 1541997148; 201426880
AB  - This current issue piece aims to address the harmful exclusion of people with disabilities in the Iranian media. In a case study, this author collected news related to statistics of HIV-positive people covered by popular news websites written in the Persian language between June 2011 and June 2012. Within the analysed electronic texts, no reference was made to the number of HIV-positive people with disabilities. Under the rubric of critical discourse analysis, one can argue that this lack of representation may also be linked to a more general level of discourse that constitutes the marginalization of people with disabilities. This damaging exclusion both legitimizes and reproduces the ideology that people with disabilities are social minorities who can be excluded to the benefit of powerful people. This current issue piece also discusses the potential negative consequences of excluding HIV-positive people with disabilities from the discourse of HIV/AIDS in the media. Ultimately, the conceivable reasons for the Iranian government failure or refusal to publish the statistics of HIV-positive people with disabilities will be provided. Studies from various countries could shed more light on the exclusion of HIV-positive people with disabilities in the media and the interplay between HIV/AIDS and disability issues.

T1  - The Political Future of Afrikaans: The Viewpoints of an Ethnic Party
AN  - 1347785365; 201318912
AB  - The relationship between language and ethnic identity is important. The importance is magnified in societies where language differences are a characteristic of inter-ethnic competition. Where language is connected to a political order, a change in that order can alter its fortunes. Afrikaans in the new South Africa constitutes an interesting context for the study of ethno-linguistics and the relationship between language and politics. With apartheid gone, the language no longer enjoys political patronage. Yet it remains an emotionally relevant and core feature of Afrikaner identity. This article considers the debate about the language's future in the light of research conducted with the Freedom Front Plus-which projects itself as South Africa's Afrikaner party. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The veil and Muslim women's identity: Cultural pressures and resistance to stereotyping
AN  - 1347782550; 201318572
AB  - This study compares Muslim women's views on wearing the veil in a Muslim majority society, Indonesia, with the Muslim minority in India. In-depth interviews reveal significant differences between the two: Majority women talk in terms of convenience, fashion, and modesty with little reference to religion as their reasons for veiling. The responses of Muslim minority women are diverse: their account of veiling stretches from religiously inspired arguments through to reasons of convenience, and to opposition against stereotypes and discrimination. Most minority women see the veil as a way of affirming their cultural identity. We argue that religious minorities are forced into constructing their cultural identity in ways that exaggerate their group belonging and difference from broader society. This may be motivated either by falling back on religious resources or by using ethnic markers to overtly oppose endemic prejudice. No such identity issue exists for the Muslim majority women. This contradicts the dominant view in non-Muslim countries in the West, where the female scarf is primarily considered a symbol of religious fundamentalism and patriarchal oppression.

T1  - The embodiment of British Italian war memory? The curious marginalization of Dennis Donnini, VC
AN  - 1283643178; 201303480
AB  - Ugolini examines the contested nature of Second World War commemoration among the Italian diasporic community in Britain. Traditionally, many ethnic groups in Britain use evidence of war-time military service as a way of forging a sense of belonging in the national imaginary but Italian memorialization tends to focus on the war-time experience of internment rather than service in the British forces. In particular, Ugolini assesses the communal neglect of the heroic story of Fusilier Dennis Donnini, a Victoria Cross winner of Italian parentage. She argues that the silence surrounding second-generation Italians who fought in British uniform reflects the durability of the concept of the 'good Italian' that prevailed in the interwar period when Mussolini's Fascist regime aimed 'to secure the allegiance' of diasporic communities to the Fascist movement in Italy. The configuration of the 'enemy alien' internee as the 'good Italian' within memorial activity reinforces the historiographic displacement of the experiences of those who served, and died, in British uniform. While Dennis Donnini VC embodies heroism and martial valour, his experience does not conform to the dominant narrative of war-time victimhood that, in turn, succeeds in diverting attention away from the complexities of Italian diasporic allegiances and an interwar communal elite compromised by it apparent support of Fascism.

T1  - Model Blacks or "Ras the Exhorter": A Quantitative Content Analysis of Black Newspapers' Coverage of the First Wave of Afro-Caribbean Immigration to the United States
AN  - 1125220591; 201240517
AB  - This article examines the depiction of first-wave West Indian immigrants to the United States in Black print culture in the early 20th century. The authors conduct a series of content analyses of four newspapers that had wide circulation in the Black community between 1910 and 1940. Each content analysis serves as an empirical test one of four common hypotheses about ethnic differentiation between West Indians and African Americans: (a) the group consciousness hypothesis, (b) the racial nationalism hypothesis, (c) the radical politics hypothesis, and (d) the model minority hypothesis. The authors find very little empirical support for either the group consciousness hypothesis or the racial nationalism hypothesis and find only a modicum of support for the radical politics hypothesis. Finally, the authors find evidence confirming the model minority hypothesis. They also find that the Black press presented an accurate portrayal of the West Indian immigrants' socioeconomic advantages to native-born Blacks.

AN  - 1023026825; 201223885
AB  - The ethnic label Zinjibari in Omani society has various connotations that depend on who is using the term and about whom it is being used. Through participant observation and within the context of ethnolinguistic identity theory, this qualitative study aims to demonstrate how the label Zinjibari can function as an outgroup or ingroup label, as a mark of solidarity, as a term of prestige or as a slur. It is also proposed that these different connotations influence language choice among Oman's Swahili speakers. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Cleaning Up the Dirty Work: Professionalization and the Management of Stigma in the Cosmetic Surgery and Tattoo Industries
AN  - 1283640126; 201303108
AB  - This article considers the similarities between the cosmetic surgery and tattoo industries, focusing on how each has transitioned from a disreputable and deviant industry to achieve varying degrees of mainstream acceptance and success. Specifically, each industry is conceptualized as engaging in "dirty work" requiring practitioners to actively reframe and legitimate their respective industry. Using Event Structure Analysis, I model and compare the development of each industry based on linear historical narratives. The resulting models illustrate the importance of events within each narrative along with their relationship to each other. Findings suggest that the creation of industry-wide professional organizations is integral to changing public perception of a given industry. Furthermore, findings show that the more hierarchical structure of the cosmetic surgery industry, as well as its integration into the medical industry, have helped it to thrive in a manner that contrasts sharply with the more disorganized structure of the tattoo industry.

T1  - Resisting blackness, embracing rightness: How Muslim Arab Sudanese women negotiate their identity in the diaspora
AN  - 1037875412; 201231052
AB  - This article considers how a Muslim cultural discourse of 'propriety' has influenced Muslim Arab Sudanese ethnic identity in two locations and time periods in an expanding diaspora. Focusing in particular on women and their embodied practices of whitening and propriety in Egypt in the nineties and the United Kingdom a decade later, I argue that the recent turn towards Muslim expressions of Sudaneseness is a form of resistance to racial labelling. While Sudanese have rejected being labelled 'black' in Egypt and in the UK, their renegotiation of a Muslim religious identity in the diaspora nevertheless confirms a racialized Sudanese ethnicity. This study contributes to the rethinking of ethnicity in a transnational space where ethnic nationalism and globalized Islamic discourse intersect with local histories and hierarchies of race and gender.

T1  - Intersectionality And The Substantive Representation Of Migrant Interests In Germany
AN  - 1322720638; 201310749
AB  - The paper uses the concept of intersectionality to examine the experiences of politicians with migrant backgrounds in Germany. The last decade has seen a significant increase in the number of persons with migrant backgrounds integrating into political parties and winning elections to both federal and regional legislatures. Do the migrant experiences of these persons shape their politics? Theories of substantive representation have suggested that gender shapes representation. What about the racial and ethnic identities that often coexist with immigrant status? Moreover, how do those identities and experiences interact with the prerogatives of party, partisanship, and regional representation? This study uses data gathered from both the federal and regional level to explore and explain the role of migrant-related concerns in the political behavior and articulated preferences of politicians with migrant background in Germany. It further explores how these relate to gender, careers, representational roles, and partisan identification. The article concludes that a consideration of the interaction of migrant identity with other factors allows us to see multiple dimensions of representation in Germany today.

T1  - From Avatar to Reality: Development, Environment and the Representation of Cameroonian Pygmies
AN  - 1125223879; 201240410
AB  - This article discusses the challenges facing indigenous peoples when external interventions are conducted in their territories. Using a discourse analysis approach, it shows how indigenous peoples are constructed by groups pursuing diverging interests. Focusing on the case of Cameroonian Pygmies, three discourses are studied: the conservationist, the development and the pro-indigenous peoples discourses. The result of the analysis shows how indigenous peoples are represented and which values and norms stand out in discourses. It highlights how the construction of one's own reality can advantage or disadvantage groups of peoples: Pygmies represent a threat to the environment for environmentalists, they are poor for development actors, and they are above all mistreated for those defending their rights. The underlying theme is the transition to "modernity", its inevitability or imposition, as well as the resistance and adaptation of indigenous peoples to external influences.

T1  - Different shades of racial colorblindness: The role of prejudice
AN  - 1023028871; 201223694
AB  - Supporters of racial colorblindness are united by their opposition to racial categorization. However, we suggest that the nature of the relationship between racial colorblindness and racial policy attitudes among Whites varies based on individual differences in racial prejudice. Across two independent samples (Studies 1a and 1b), we demonstrated that colorblindness predicts opposition to affirmative action for low prejudice Whites. For high prejudice Whites, who presumably oppose affirmative action regardless of colorblind concerns, no significant relationship between colorblindness and affirmative action support was found. In Study 2, we examined the relationship between various rationales for supporting colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes, and again detected moderation by prejudice. Low prejudice Whites' evaluations of affirmative action appeared to be based upon perceptions of declining discrimination as well as a concern for balancing the interests of both Whites and minorities. The affirmative action attitudes of high prejudice Whites, in contrast, appeared to be based primarily upon defending the interests of their racial ingroup. The implications of these findings for theoreticians and social justice advocates are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Race and Criminology in the Age of Genomic Science
AN  - 1283644166; 201303497
AB  - Objective: To survey the contemporary literature in the social and biological sciences relevant to race that examines both the reality and the usefulness of the concept. Race is considered a major correlate of criminal behavior, and thus a fresh look at the concept is of obvious importance to criminologists and sociologists. Method: Social, genetic, medical, and criminology databases were keyword searched for articles on race that either addressed its existence/nonexistence or usefulness as a concept. Results: We find that biologist and social constructionists talk past one another and never venture beyond the comfort of their own positions. Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories. Conclusion: There is much to gain by recognizing that these categories differ genetically, and that we can dispense with the term race in favor of some other term such as population or ethnic group and nothing would be lost except a word.

T1  - Ethnoracial patterns of schooling and work among adolescents: Implications for Mexican immigrant incorporation
AN  - 964199627; 201207383
AB  - This paper investigates Mexican immigrant incorporation by examining labor force participation and schooling among Mexican-origin adolescents in the United States. Theoretical perspectives on immigrant incorporation, labor migration-related cultural repertoires and adolescent development considered together imply that studying ethnoracial differences in schooling among adolescents without taking work into account can yield mis-leading pictures of Mexican-origin non-high school completion patterns, thus hampering the assessment of incorporation theories. To avoid this, we analyze Mexican-origin generational differences in the relationship between schooling and workforce participation among adolescents compared to non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Using micro-data from the 2000 US Census, we find that Mexican immigrant boys who are not enrolled in school are more likely to be in the workforce, and conversely that those who are enrolled in school are much less likely to be in the workforce, compared to whites and blacks. Such relative differences in school/work specialization, as predicted, diminish across Mexican-origin generations. Moreover, based on supplementary analyses, we find similar patterns for a cohort of young adults who failed to complete high school during the 1990s. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that cultural orientations growing out of the nature and experience of Mexican labor migration are important for assessing school enrollment patterns among Mexican-origin youth and for gauging their implications for educational policy and immigrant-group incorporation.

T1  - Ethnic Variations in the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Psychological Distress Among Latino Adults
AN  - 1081863844; 201235407
AB  - This study investigated the association between SES and psychological distress among Latinos. Data were from the National Latino and Asian American Study's Cuban (N = 577), Mexican (N = 868), and Puerto Rican (N = 495) adult samples. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between SES measured as education, household income, and wealth and psychological distress for three Latino subgroups, respectively. Results indicate that wealth is the most important predictor for all three Latino groups. Cubans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans are all disadvantaged on wealth possession and being in debt is associated with more psychological distress for them. The health benefit of wealth is especially significant for Cubans and Puerto Ricans. In contrast with findings in many previous studies, household income is not significantly related to mental health. The finding that only wealth is weakly associated with psychological distress among Mexicans suggests that the Hispanic Health Paradox only applies to Mexicans. Education is strongly associated with distress among Cubans, with college degrees producing the largest protection from mental illness. Findings also indicate that physical health and discrimination are strongly associated with psychological distress independent of the SES measures. This study contributes to an understanding of the health significance of SES among Latinos. It highlights the importance of examining ethnic variations in the association of socioeconomic status and mental health among Latinos and of identifying the mental health impact of various measures of socioeconomic status.

T1  - Conversion vs. Tolerance: Minority-focused influence strategies can affect group loyalty
AN  - 964198136; 201207182
AB  - Past research has documented that social change has different implications for group identification when it is effected through successful minority's advocacy for tolerance of diversity vs. conversion of opponents to supporters. Extending these findings, the current study demonstrated that minorities who successfully advocated tolerance, compared to those who successfully converted opponents, were more loyal to the group. This was evident in their working harder for the group at their own personal expense and without expecting anything in return. The effect of influence strategy on group loyalty was mediated by evaluative and cognitive components of group identification. Implications for group dynamics in which active minorities employ different influence strategies and their motivational underpinnings are discussed.

T1  - Pakeha Women and Maori Protocol: The Politics of Criticising Other Cultures
AN  - 1023030702; 201223820
AB  - Feminists have fiercely debated whether it is wrong for outsiders to criticise gendered customs and practices identified with cultural minorities. This article explores the ethics of criticising other cultures by analysing the reaction to public criticism of Maori ceremonial protocol by two Pakeha women. It argues that the response to outsiders' criticism does not depend in a simple and direct way on whether insiders have resisted the criticised practice. There is a history of Maori women formulating critiques of the gender roles in Maori ceremonies, but the public response from Maori women to the Pakeha women's criticism was overwhelmingly negative. The outsiders' criticism was understood as an attack on the incorporation of Maori cultural expression into the public sector, rather than as a gesture of support or solidarity.

T1  - Diverse Pathways to Immigrant Political Incorporation: Comparative Canadian and U.S. Perspectives
AN  - 1023029110; 201225047
AB  - In both Canada and the United States, immigration is producing major demographic and sociocultural changes. Yet relatively little research has been devoted to the impact of immigration on each country's political life. Even less attention has been paid to comparing the patterns of immigrant political participation in both countries. This has left underinvestigated a host of important questions about the body politic of Canada and the United States: Measured at national, urban, and community scales, do immigrants in the two countries become integrated into formal politics such as voting and running for elected office? Are they engaged in more informal political activities such as community and ethnic organizing? If so, then how do various immigrant communities mobilize politically, form agendas and alliances, express their voices, and expand their opportunities? As more countries and cities around the world become immigration destinations, there is much to be learned about creating inclusive political systems from the comparative experience of Canada and the United States illustrated in this volume.

T1  - The next generation of Assyrians in Sweden: religiosity as a functioning system of meaning within the process of acculturation
AN  - 1023024763; 201223807
AB  - For ethnic groups in which religion is an important dimension of culture, attention needs to be paid to religiosity as a system of meaning when studying their process of acculturation. Using a sequential mixed model research approach, where quantitative have preceded qualitative methods, three generations of the Assyrian population in a Swedish city have been studied concerning their acculturation processes in relation to religious values and practices. The research question guiding this study is: Does religiosity function as a system of meaning among the Assyrian youth in Sweden? The main objective of this study is to highlight the role of religiosity in the process of acculturation. The quantitative questionnaire material shows that religious values and practices decline from the first to the third generation (statistical significance at p < 0.001). The qualitative interview study with members of the third generation shows that religion has been a positive part of childhood. In adulthood, however, other systems of meaning also have become central at the same time as religious institutions and representatives are being criticised. This change needs to be understood against the background of the Swedish cultural context, one of the most secularised in the world. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Between Black and Brown: Blaxican (Black-Mexican) Multiracial Identity in California
AN  - 964198527; 201207495
AB  - This article explores the racial/ethnic identities of multiracial Black-Mexicans or "Blaxicans." In-depth interviews with 12 Blaxican individuals in California reveal how they negotiate distinct cultural systems to accomplish multiracial identities. I argue that choosing, accomplishing, and asserting a Blaxican identity challenges the dominant monoracial discourse in the United States, in particular among African American and Chicana/o communities. That is, Blaxican respondents are held accountable by African Americans and Chicanas/os/Mexicans to monoracial notions of "authenticity." The process whereby Blaxicans move between these monoracial spaces to create multiracial identities illustrates crucial aspects of the social construction of race/ethnicity in the United States and the influence of social interactions in shaping how Blaxicans develop their multiracial identities.

T1  - Racial Disparities in Health: How Much Does Stress Really Matter
AN  - 887500749; 201118200
AB  - Despite the widespread assumption that racial differences in stress exist and that stress is a key mediator linking racial status to poor health, relatively few studies have explicitly examined this premise. We examine the distribution of stress across racial groups and the role of stress vulnerability and exposure in explaining racial differences in health in a community sample of Black, Hispanic, and White adults, employing a modeling strategy that accounts for the correlation between types of stressors and the accumulation of stressors in the prediction of health outcomes. We find significant racial differences in overall and cumulative exposure to eight stress domains. Blacks exhibit a higher prevalence and greater clustering of high stress scores than Whites. American-born Hispanics show prevalence rates and patterns of accumulation of stressors comparable to Blacks, while foreign-born Hispanics have stress profiles similar to Whites. Multiple stressors correlate with poor physical and mental health, with financial and relationship stressors exhibiting the largest and most consistent effects. Though we find no support for the stress-vulnerability hypothesis, the stress-exposure hypothesis does account for some racial health disparities. We discuss implications for future research and policy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trans-systemic Society and Regional Perspective in Chinese Studies
AN  - 887498917; 201118127
AB  - This essay proposes to establish a connection between the concept of "trans-systemic society" and the concept of "region" mainly for two reasons. On the one hand, the idea of region, which is distinct both from nation-state and from ethnicity, and which is based on a special human geography and culture, is uniquely hybrid, fluid, and integrated. Thus, it affords us a perspective that transcends nationalism with which to reinterpret China and its historical evolution. On the other hand, the idea of trans-systemic society shows a society composed of different ethnic groups or nationalities, religions, and even civilizations, which is also intertwined with the concept of trans-societal system. For example, the tributary system in Chinese history is not only a mode of contact in a trans-systemic society but also a form of network in the trans-societal system. It links various political communities within a broader region. Therefore, revisiting the idea of region, especially the idea of ethnic region, through the lens of trans-systemic society and trans-societal system, is crucial to addressing such questions as "How do we understand China?" or "What is China?".

T1  - Racial/ethnic residential segregation: Framing the context of health risk and health disparities
AN  - 881468852; 201116487
AB  - An increasing body of public health literature links patterns of racial/ethnic residential segregation to health status and health disparities. Despite substantial new empirical work, meaningful understanding of the pathways through which segregation operates to influence health remains elusive. The literature on segregation and health was appraised with an emphasis on select conceptual, methodological, and analytical issues. Recommendations for advancing the next generation of racial/ethnic residential segregation and health research will require closer attention to sharpening the methodology of measuring segregation, testing mediating pathways and effect modification, incorporating stronger test of causality, exploring factors of resilience in segregated areas, applying a life-course perspective, broadening the scope of the investigation of segregation to include nativity status in blacks and other racial/ethnic groups, and linking segregation measures with biological data.

T1  - To Belong in Aotearoa New Zealand: Latin American Migrant Experiences in Multicultural Auckland
AN  - 870432687; 201114263
AB  - In this paper, I give voice to Latin Americans' ideas about belonging in Aotearoa New Zealand society. As a small, low-profile migrant community in Auckland, their self-positioning in the urban social matrix is especially interesting because of New Zealand's official policy as a bicultural nation, aspiring to an equal partnership between indigenous Maori and Pakeha (European New Zealanders). This study is situated in the context of transnational migration research which stresses the potential for migrants to use transnational linkages to negotiate 'belonging' in the receiving society. Due to New Zealand's revised immigration laws in the late 1980s, the cultural composition of Auckland has changed enormously in the last decades. Increasing non-white immigration has challenged New Zealand's national identity as a bicultural, but predominantly white, society in the South Pacific. However, it is unclear where other ethnic groups are situated in this bicultural framework. Based on fieldwork and discursive accounts, I scrutinise Latin American migrants' understanding of biculturalism in a multicultural context. I am particularly interested in their self-positioning in the wider social matrix and in the contested forms of (self-)inclusion and exclusion. I situate these practices in migrants' biographies as they are shaped by political ideas, class and economic opportunities. I argue that these conditions are key in migrants' perceptions of 'belonging' and self-positioning in the urban ambit. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Threatening Intergroup Relationships: Personal Versus Group-Related Moderators of Conformity as a Function of the Level of Self-Categorization
AN  - 964196708; 201207219
AB  - Five experiments investigated among nonsmokers with initial antismoking attitudes conformity to a norm of intergroup tolerance and nondiscrimination (i.e., a counterattitudinal norm) as a function of the personal versus categorical referent used in intergroup comparisons (self-categorization level), the motivation to respond without prejudice, and the perceived ingroup threat. Results showed that conformity (i.e., a reduction of support for antismoking actions) was moderated by the ingroup threat in the category-referent condition (i.e., conformity was observed only when the perceived threat was low), but by the internal motivation to respond without prejudice in the personal-referent condition. These findings suggest the existence of different moderators of conformity as a function of the self-categorization level. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Why Swiss-Germans Dislike Germans: Opposition to culturally similar and highly skilled immigrants
AN  - 870432146; 201114273
AB  - This paper considers two common assumptions that often arise in the empirical literature on xenophobia -- namely that xenophobic attitudes are found mostly among the poorly educated, and that xenophobia mainly concerns immigrants from low social classes and from geographically and culturally disparate nations. These arguments will be discussed in the context of the migration of high-skilled Germans to Switzerland, a phenomenon that has increased markedly in the last few years, leading to major controversies. A survey conducted in the city of Zurich has shown that Germans are considered less likable than other Western Europeans. Over the course of our analyses, two arguments are tested. First, I consider whether the boundaries between culturally similar groups are actually less fragile than those occurring between more dissimilar groups. Following this line of reasoning, I consider whether Swiss-Germans perceive German immigration as a cultural threat. Second, I consider whether well-educated people in high positions or people who seek to improve their job positions may feel threatened by new arrivals who are similarly well-educated. This rationale corresponds to the classic argument that working class people are xenophobic out of a fear that immigrants will take their jobs. Ultimately, this study finds empirical support for both arguments. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Blinded by the Accent! The Minor Role of Looks in Ethnic Categorization
AN  - 856403615; 201106935
AB  - The categories that social targets belong to are often activated automatically. Most studies investigating social categorization have used visual stimuli or verbal labels, whereas ethnolinguistic identity theory posits that language is an essential dimension of ethnic identity. Language should therefore be used for social categorization. In 2 experiments, using the 'Who Said What?' paradigm, the authors investigated social categorization by using accents (auditory stimuli) and looks (visual stimuli) to indicate ethnicity, either separately or in combination. Given either looks or accents only, the authors demonstrated that ethnic categorization can be based on accents, and the authors found a similar degree of ethnic categorization by accents and looks. When ethnic cues of looks and accents were combined by creating cross categories, there was a clear predominance of accents as meaningful cues for categorization, as shown in the respective parameters of a multinomial model. The present findings are discussed with regard to the generalizability of findings using one channel of presentation (e.g., visual) and the asymmetry found with different presentation channels for the category ethnicity.

T1  - Imposed Politics Of Cultural Differences: Managed Multiculturalism in Israeli Civil Society
AN  - 1081865211; 201235335
AB  - This article analyzes the processes by which multicultural discourses and practices are implemented and adapted in local settings. Based on five years of ethnographic fieldwork in an Israeli NGO that promotes economic and social rights, this work examines the micro-politics of multiculturalism and the complex uses of this concept by various Jewish and Arab actors in the organization. The research shows how multicultural notions concerning Arab culture were introduced by the Jewish actors in order to depoliticize Jewish-Arab relations and preserve the balance and stability within the organization. By adopting characteristics of state multiculturalism-in a country where multiculturalism is not an aspect of official government policy-the Jewish actors attempted to produce social change while preserving central elements in the hegemonic Zionist-nationalistic worldview.

T1  - Success on European Labor Markets: A Cross-national Comparison of Attainment between Immigrant and Majority Populations
AN  - 1023027478; 201223945
AB  - Typical labor market outcomes vary considerably between majority and migrant populations. Drawing on scholarship from across the social sciences, we assess competing micro- and macro-level explanations of differential occupational attainment among immigrant groups across 28 countries. The analyses of occupational attainment are run separately for first- and second-generation migrants as well as children of mixed marriage and take into account their wider social and cultural background. Results from four rounds of the European Social Survey show that people with a migration background do not necessarily achieve a lower labor market success than the majority. However, human capital, social mobility, and cultural background explain these outcomes to different degrees, suggesting tailored pathways to labor market success for each group of migrants. We also find that occupational attainment varies considerably across countries, although this is hardly attributable to immigration policies. These and other findings are discussed in the light of previous studies on immigrant incorporation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can the American Dream Survive the New Multiethnic America? Evidence from Los Angeles
AN  - 1010633277; 201210492
AB  - Drawing from a survey conducted in Los Angeles, we examine perceptions of achievement and optimism about reaching the American dream among racial, ethnic, and nativity groups. We find blacks and Asian Americans less likely than whites to believe they have reached the American dream. Latinos stand out for their upbeat assessments, with naturalized citizens possessing a stronger sense of achievement and noncitizens generally optimistic that they will eventually fulfill the American dream. We discuss patterns of variation between the racial and ethnic groups as well as variation within each group. Notwithstanding interesting differences along lines of race, ethnicity, and nativity, we find no evidence that the nation's changing ethnic stew has diluted faith in the American dream.

T1  - Racial Prejudice and Spending on Drug Rehabilitation: The Role of Attitudes Toward Blacks and Latinos
AN  - 868013788; 201113973
AB  - We enhance understanding of the prejudice-induced color coding phenomenon among whites by determining whether racial and ethnic prejudices are associated with a previously unexplored policy outcome, spending on drug rehabilitation. We examine attitudes toward both blacks and Latinos; the latter is a group largely ignored in previous research. We assess the impact of several types of racial/ethnic views, including those that manifest modern/indirect prejudice (e.g., stereotypes about violence, individualistic causal attributions) and those that reflect social-distance-based traditional prejudice (opposition to residential proximity and to interracial marriage). These relationships are examined using data from the General Social Survey. Bivariate results support the linkage between both traditional and modern prejudice and rehabilitation spending. Logistic regression analyses also indicate that support for rehabilitation is racialized: Attributing race differences in socioeconomic outcomes to structural factors, namely discrimination and lack of chance for education, is associated with believing rehabilitation spending is inadequate, controlling for the effects of other racial/ethnic attitudes and background factors. The relationship between this measure of modern prejudice and the outcome is consistent with color coding. The implications of the findings are discussed, and suggestions for future research that further examine the scope of color coding are offered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Researching ethnic conflicts in Nigeria: the missing link
AN  - 835111642; 201100538
AB  - The renewed upsurge in ethnic and communal conflicts in Nigeria has generated increased interests in ethnic conflicts studies. A dominant approach in the literature is the concentration on the study of inter-ethnic conflicts at the expense of intra-ethnic conflicts. However, experiences have shown that intra-ethnic conflicts are as equally preponderant and bloody as inter-ethnic conflicts, suggesting that considerable research attention be directed at them. This paper sheds light on the perseverance of sub-ethnic identities and conflicts in Nigeria. It traces the evolution of ethnic conflict research in Nigeria, explores the existing literature on ethnic conflicts and points to the neglect of intra-ethnic conflicts. The consequence, the paper concludes, is that knowledge of ethnic conflicts in Nigeria is likely to be insufficient and undeveloped. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - ARTICULATING A POLITICS OF (MULTIPLE) IDENTITIES
AN  - 852898619; 201103321
AB  - This work examines the strategies Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people use in Black environments to proclaim a gay identity that is simultaneous with a Black identity. It identifies three distinctive features of LGBT protest in Black communities. Black gay protest takes on a particular form when individuals are also trying to maintain solidarity with the racial group despite the threat of distancing that occurs as a result of their sexual minority status. Black sexual minorities who see their self-interests as linked to those of other Blacks use cultural references to connect their struggles to historical efforts for Black equality and draw from nationalist symbols and language to frame their political work. They believe that increasing their visibility in Black spaces will promote a greater understanding of gay sexuality as an identity status that can exist alongside, rather than in competition with, race. The findings of this research have implications for larger discussions of identity, protest, and gay sexuality in intraracial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Urban residents' subtle prejudice towards rural-to-urban migrants in China: The role of socioeconomic status and adaptation styles
AN  - 743067068; 201043404
AB  - The household registration system (Hukou) implemented by the Chinese government divides the Chinese society into two groups: urban residents and rural residents. Since the 1980s, millions of rural residents have migrated to cities without official permission. In this paper, we investigate urban residents' subtle prejudice towards rural-to-urban migrants. Specifically, the impacts of urban residents' socioeconomic status (SES) and their perception of migrants' adaptation styles are examined. A sample including 457 Chinese urban residents is taken from four cities in China. Educational and occupational levels are used to indicate urban residents' SES. Four adaptation styles (integration, assimilation, separation and marginalization) are manipulated by using vignettes. The results show that SES has a negative impact on urban residents' subtle prejudice. This link is further moderated by urban residents' perceptions of migrants' adaptations: the negative effect of SES on subtle prejudice holds only under a perception of integration or assimilation and disappears under a perception of separation or marginalization.

T1  - Barriers to immigrants' integration into the labor market: Modes and coping
AN  - 743056536; 201031927
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate similarities and particularities of barriers encountered by different immigrant groups when entering the labor market, to define the modes of how immigrants deal with barriers and to detect determinants influencing these modes, comparing two groups of immigrants to Israel. On the basis of twofold criteria (number of barriers and coping with barriers) we created modes classifying the ways in which immigrants deal with barriers: "the easy going", encountered few barriers and showed high coping; "the fighters", - many barriers and high coping; "the incapable", - few barriers and low coping, and "the disadvantaged", - many barriers and low coping. Whereas the majority of the Ethiopian immigrants were dispersed between the "disadvantaged" and "fighters" modes, the majority of Former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants were positioned in the "fighters" mode. The results reveal that FSU immigrants encountered different barriers than immigrants from Ethiopia and coped with them better. Human capital characteristics of immigrants explain the distribution of immigrants between the modes. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Determining 'truth' at the border: Immigration interviews, Chinese marital migrants, and Taiwan's sovereignty dilemmas
AN  - 743065773; 201043251
AB  - As Taiwan transitions from an immigrant-sending to an immigrant-receiving country, it struggles to build an immigration bureaucracy while its status as a sovereign nation-state is not recognized by much of the international community. Taiwan's largest immigrant group, marital migrants from China, are perceived as posing the greatest challenges to border control due to longstanding political tensions between the two countries and governmental and societal suspicions about Chinese spouses' marital motives. Based on research conducted with immigration officials and during immigration interviews at the border, this article interrogates the status of 'truth' in official efforts to determine definitively immigrants' marital intentions. It analyzes such truth demands in relation to Taiwan's anxieties about its national standing and the ability of an immigration bureaucracy to generate 'sovereignty effects'.

T1  - Desirable Difference: The Shadow of Racial Stereotypes in Creating Transracial Families through Transnational Adoption
AN  - 743043283; 201026573
AB  - The article analyzes how parents decide to adopt a child transnationally by detailing how the meaning of race is articulated in the formation of family. Drawing from my interviews with adoptive parents, I examine how they internalize ideas about different racial groups. For example, I investigate how what they have learned from the adoption agencies, their own perceptions of racial stereotypes, and their perceptions of the communities in which they reside influence their understanding of race. The article suggests that adoptive parents, when considering whether to adopt children from the U.S. or overseas, use a criteria dictated by racial stereotypes in understanding Asian Americans as the model minority, African-Americans as a deficient group, and Latinos occupying an intermediary position.

T1  - Covert Racism and the Formation of Social Capital among a Volunteer Youth Corps
AN  - 743060127; 201031662
AB  - In this ethnographic case study, I examine the race-ethnic and educational network patterns of association and subsequent social capital formation of 41 youth volunteers working for a national leadership program. Findings indicate that race-ethnic minority youth are more likely than white youth to cross race-ethnic and educational boundaries in their network (discussion partner) choices. White college-educated men report the highest levels of social capital benefits from their year-long program. White college-educated females, black high-school (and GED only) males, and white high-school males reported relatively lower levels of social capital formation and opportunities, with black males least satisfied with their experiences. The ethnographic data reveal how powerful racial identity is in the formation of social networks. The findings demonstrate the subtle ways in which covert racism continues to shape the reproduction of race-ethnic inequalities even in this civic organization that explicitly seeks to equalize opportunities.

T1  - The Potential Roles of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, Stigma Consciousness, and Stereotype Threat in Linking Latino-a Ethnicity and Educational Outcomes
AN  - 60356523; 201017486
AB  - Acculturation and ethnic identity may be associated with Latino-as' educational outcomes and be relevant to their lower levels of academic achievement. This article explores how these relationships might be mediated by considering several empirically supported and theory-based social psychological processes-the self-fulfilling prophecy, stigma consciousness, and stereotype threat. These processes suggest specific mediational mechanisms that remain largely unexamined, thereby offering novel directions for research and the potential to enrich understanding of the relationship between Latino-a ethnicity and academic performance. Consideration of these mediational mechanisms suggests that some groups within the Latino-a population face even greater challenges with regard to educational achievement. Accordingly, the particular difficulties encountered by Latinas and the children of families of migrant workers and new and undocumented immigrants are discussed. In addition, the potential relevance of education policies to the operation of the reviewed processes is explored. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Politics of Perception: An Investigation of the Presence and Sources of Perceptions of Internal Discrimination Among Latinos*
AN  - 60320249; 201005017
AB  - Objective. This study investigates the presence of perceptions of internal discrimination among Latinos, and whether three factors impact views of internal discrimination within the Latino population: social integration and discrimination experiences, national origin, and racial identity. Methods. Utilizing data from the 2002 Kaiser/Pew Latino National Survey of Latinos, we explore the presence and motivating factors of perceptions of internal discrimination within the Latino population in the United States through descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analysis. Results. We find that 84 percent of Latinos in the survey sample believe that Latino internal discrimination is problematic, and also find support for our theories that perceptions of internal discrimination are greater for those who are less integrated into U.S. society, as well as for Latinos who self-identify as black. Conclusion. Findings from this research contribute to our understanding of Latino group identity and will have tremendous implications for the measurement and application of perceived discrimination in future studies.
