T1  - When women support the status quo: Gender moderates the relationship between openness to experience and system-justifying beliefs: GPIR
AN  - 2669413265
AB  - Although epistemic needs motivate the endorsement of system-justifying beliefs, few studies have investigated moderators of this association. Here, we argue that because being the target of discrimination should undermine one’s sense of control, the association between epistemic needs and system-justifying beliefs should be stronger for disadvantaged (vs. advantaged) groups. As hypothesized, analyses of a nation-wide random sample of adults (N = 14,929) revealed that the negative relationship between openness to experience (i.e., an indicator of low epistemic needs) and multiple system-justifying beliefs (i.e., gender-based system justification, right-wing political preference, and conservative party support) was stronger for women (vs. men), and that these moderated associations were mediated by perceptions of gender discrimination. Our results suggest that women may sometimes endorse beliefs that conflict with their self and group interests in order to satisfy their epistemic needs.

T1  - Hierarchy, Resentment, and Pride: Politics of Identity and Belonging among Mosuo, Yi, and Han in Southwest China
AN  - 2651992603
AB  - How do non-Han populations in China navigate the paradoxical expectations to become “proper” Chinese citizens, like the majority Han, while retaining pride in cultural practices and traditions that mark their differences? This article examines how Mosuo (otherwise known as Na) people in Southwest China have constructed the moral legitimacy of their ethnic traditions and identity through redirecting the Orientalizing gaze toward their Yi neighbors, another ethnic minority in the region. This argument, which displaces the analytical focus from the majority Han and the political state in analyses of the maintenance of ethnic boundaries, delineates how prejudice against a third-party ethnic other can serve as an important pathway for establishing cultural citizenship in the People’s Republic of China. The article ends with a discussion of the methodological significance of this lens for understanding interethnic relationships, while recognizing the challenges of examining ethnic prejudice as a site for negotiating identity and citizenship.

T1  - Testing the basic socio‐structural assumptions of social identity theory in the gender context: Evidence from correlational studies on women's leadership
AN  - 2636840646
AB  - Given negative social identity, different perceptions of the structure of an intergroup relation (i.e., stability, legitimacy, permeability) should be related to different identity‐management strategies (i.e., social competition, social creativity, or individual mobility) depending on group identification. This is among the basic tenets of social identity theory (SIT). There is surprisingly little empirical support for these postulates in the context of one of the most central group identities: gender. Using a sample of female leaders in Spain in a Pilot Study (N = 649) and in Germany in the preregistered Main Study (N = 687), we tested relations between structural perceptions and identity‐management strategies. Whereas structural equation modeling yielded empirical support regarding social competition but little for other strategies in the Pilot Study, the results were even less in line with SIT's predictions in the Main Study. We discuss reasons why only weak support for SIT emerged in this intergroup context.

T1  - The effect of group membership and individuating information on automatic and deliberate evaluation of well-known people
AN  - 2601601439
AB  - People's automatic (unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient) preference between social groups often determines their automatic preference between unknown individual members of these groups, a prominent example for automatic prejudice. What happens when the person making the judgment has long known the target individuals? Practice might automatize the deliberate judgment of the individuals. Then, if deliberate judgment is nonprejudiced, automatic prejudice might decrease. In 29 studies (total N = 4,907), we compared preferences between a famous member of a dominant social group and a famous member of a stigmatized social group on indirect measures of evaluation that were developed to measure automatic preference and on self-report measures. In most studies, we chose pairs based on prior self-reported preference for the member of the stigmatized group. The measures showed discrepancy, with indirect measures suggesting an automatic preference for the member of the dominant group. We replicated these results with various target individuals, two pairs of social groups (Black/White, old/young), two indirect measures, and in two countries (Studies 1–23). The indirectly measured prodominant preference was stronger when visual characteristics of the group were present rather than absent (Studies 24 and 25), suggesting a stronger effect of group characteristics on automatic than on deliberate preference between the individuals. On self-report and indirect measures, the preferences between individuals were related to the preferences between their groups (Studies 26 and 27) yet also to individuating information (Studies 28 and 29). Our results suggest that group evaluation plays a central role in the automatic evaluation of familiar (and not only novel) members of stigmatized groups.

T1  - Crossing back over the Rubicon: Collectivistic value orientation and independent self-concept jointly promote effective goal revision in task groups: GPIR
AN  - 2573356336
AB  - When the ultimate goal of the group is found to be unattainable via the chosen means (i.e., a subgoal), effective goal management requires group members to disengage from that failing subgoal and reengage with a feasible alternative. The present study investigated the combined role of group members’ value orientation and their self-concept in collective goal revision in task groups. In a laboratory experiment involving 55 three-person groups, we induced either a collectivistic or individualistic value orientation and made salient either an independent or interdependent self-concept. As expected, groups that combined a collectivistic value orientation and an independent self-concept were less likely to be entrapped in a failing subgoal and more likely to reengage with the ultimate group goal via an available alternative. Also as expected, this effect was mediated by the degree of goal-related reflection among the members during group interaction. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - The effect of imagined contact valence on adolescents’ and early adults’ stereotypes, emotions, and behavioral intentions toward ethnic groups
AN  - 2555683405
AB  - Across two experimental studies, this research examined the effects of positive and negative imagined intergroup contact on adolescents’ (Study 1, N = 124) and early adults’ (Study 2, N = 169) stereotype content, emotions, and behavioral intentions toward two immigrant groups in Spain: Ecuadorians, a valued group, and Moroccans, a devalued group. The results showed that the imagined contact valence influenced only adolescents’ outgroup evaluations and only toward Moroccans, the devalued targeted group. Specifically, negative contact indirectly triggered passive harm tendencies through increased negative emotions toward Moroccans. Our findings support previous studies regarding the stronger effect of negative contact on attitudes toward devalued outgroups.

T1  - Moderators of intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups: A comprehensive test of predictions from system justification theory
AN  - 2546134409
AB  - We examined hypotheses proposed by System Justification Theory (SJT; Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004) regarding intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups, using large samples of online participants (total N = 715,721), spanning 8 intergroup domains and 14 nations. Using a meta-analytic approach, we tested these hypotheses at the individual level (as SJT is generally articulated), as well as at the social group level. Consistent with SJT, individual-level analyses revealed that disadvantaged groups demonstrated outgroup favoritism on Implicit Association Tests (IATs; i.e., implicit measures), but demonstrated ingroup favoritism or no intergroup preference on self-report (i.e., explicit) measures. Additionally, these average effects were characterized by high heterogeneity, and follow-up exploratory analyses revealed that intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups was moderated by the intergroup domain: Whereas some disadvantaged groups consistently displayed outgroup favoritism (e.g., age, weight), others consistently displayed ingroup favoritism (e.g., sexual orientation, religion), and yet others displayed diverging patterns on implicit and explicit measures (e.g., race, ethnicity). Consistent with SJT, intergroup evaluation on all measures was moderated by self-reported conservatism. Furthermore, the magnitude of these relationships depended on the level of analysis, with small effects emerging at the individual level and medium-sized effects emerging at the social group level. Social group-level analyses also indicated that intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups was moderated by stigma. Overall, these findings support and extend the predictions of SJT, but the relatively complex patterns of intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups identified here illustrate a need for further theory development and more theory-driven research in this domain.

T1  - “We are the victims of racism”: Victim categories in negotiating claims about racism against Black‐Africans in India
AN  - 2581010372
AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black‐Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black‐Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism.

T1  - Identity construction among twice-minority immigrants: a comparative study of Korean-Chinese and Uyghurs in the United States
AN  - 2509429397
AB  - ‘Twice-minority’ immigrants, immigrants who are ethnic minorities in both their home country and country of destination, may face ambiguity and multiple options in their ethnic self-identification in the host society. This paper investigates the dynamics in the identity construction among such groups. My data comes from in-depth interviews with 40 recent immigrants in the United States from two minority ethnic groups in China: Korean-Chinese and Uyghur. I find that these two groups’ perceived phenotypical and cultural difference from (or similarity to) the majority Han ethnic group in China, experiences of prejudice in China, and pre-existing transnational ethnic ties influence the identity dynamics in their interactions with different groups in the U.S. Both Korean-Chinese and Uyghur immigrants experience a mix of pulling and pushing forces towards identities associated with different proximal host groups in these interactions, but Uyghur immigrants’ identity options are constrained by their phenotypical distinctness from the Han Chinese. Both groups maintain their distinct ethnic identity in the host society, but they find different new bases for their twice-minority identity. The article shows how everyday interactions with multiple ethnic audiences shape possibilities of identity and ethnicisation and helps us better understand ethnic identity and transnational movement of ethnic schemas.

T1  - Perceptions of Racial Slurs Used by Black Individuals Toward White Individuals: Derogation or Affiliation?
AN  - 2436792259
AB  - Research suggests that racial slurs may be “reclaimed” by the targeted group to convey affiliation rather than derogation. Although it is most common in intragroup uses (e.g., “nigga” by a Black individual toward another Black individual), intergroup examples of slur reappropriation (e.g., “nigga” by a Black individual toward a White individual) are also common. However, majority and minority group members’ perceptions of intergroup slur reappropriation remain untested. We examined White (Study 1) and Black (Study 2) individuals’ perceptions of the reappropriated terms, “nigga” and “nigger” compared with a control term chosen to be a non-race-related, neutral term (“buddy”), a nonracial derogative term (“asshole”) and a White racial slur (“cracker”) used by a Black individual toward a White individual. We found that the intergroup use of reappropriated slurs was perceived quite positively by both White and Black individuals. Our findings have important implications for research on intergroup relations and the reappropriation of slurs.

T1  - Expectations for cross-ethnic inclusion by Asian American children and adolescents: GPIR
AN  - 2429520640
AB  - Asian American youth’s inclusion decisions were investigated in cross-ethnic peer contexts (Asian and non-Asian). Ten-, 13-, and 16-year-old participants (N = 134), enrolled in U.S. schools, decided whether to include a same-ethnic peer with different interests or a different-ethnic peer with similar interests. Findings showed that with age, participants more frequently included a peer who shared interests even when this peer was not of the same ethnicity. Participants expected their peer groups to be equally inclusive of others of both ethnic backgrounds, and expected that in-group parents would be less inclusive of cross-ethnic peers. In addition, adolescents expected parents to have prejudicial attitudes about ethnic out-group members. Views about peer group and in-group parents’ inclusivity diverged from adolescents’ own inclusivity. These findings point to areas for intervention regarding the promotion of cross-group friendships and the reduction of prejudice.

T1  - Implications of Individualist Bias in Social Identity Theory for Cross-Cultural Organizational Psychology
AN  - 2429062812
AB  - Social Identity Theory (SIT) as used in cross-cultural organizational psychology (CCOP) shows individualistic biases by envisioning an autonomous person whose culture supports temporary, largely independent, and readily interchangeable relationships with multiple categorical groups, organizations, and other collectives. We seek to reduce these biases in CCOP by drawing from recent social psychological analyses, notably Motivated Identity Construction Theory, that have refined identity theory’s original principles. To make a broad range of organizational applications, we rely heavily on our cross-cultural psychology audience’s familiarity with basic SIT topics and controversies by discussing them quite briefly. We apply such refinements to theories about correlates of organizational identification (OI) measures, interpretive OI theorizing, and an intrapersonal network approach to OI. We conclude by extending these refinements to other constructs linking individuals to organizations: organizational commitment, attachments to organization groups and components, and roles and norms.

T1  - Closeted love? Borders of (mediated) belonging in ‘minority radio broadcasting’
AN  - 2407556788
AB  - Ethnic minority communities have been utilizing various forms of media for the struggle for rights and recognition for ethnic minorities and migrants, aiming to subvert mainstream discourses, and engage in creative tactics and strategies to struggle for equal rights, opportunities, supportive public opinion and inclusive policy-making/policy change. Whilst social media has become the major platform for ethnic minorities to express these struggles, there has been growing concerns on the role of (radio) broadcasting as a better/more effective channel for ethnic ‘activism’. This article aims to unravel the divergent narrativity and politics of ‘minority recognition’ in the broadcasting space: How have the technological and institutional features of public service broadcasting enabled minority mediated belonging. At the same time, has this also hampered their chances of being heard? Through sample surveys, textual analysis as well as focused interviews, the article hopes to articulate the nuanced strategic and diverse ‘regimes’ of minority recognition by way of discussing the role of broadcasting as a space of (mediated) belonging. I also hope to contribute to the debates about the intricate bordering and politics of affective listening, in the case of public service broadcasting, and particularly in an ethnoscape such as Hong Kong

T1  - How to address the caveat of avoiding direct contact: Reducing prejudice towards gay and lesbian people in five Balkan countries
AN  - 2353192181
AB  - In the Balkans, contact with gays and lesbians is typically hostile or avoided. Drawing from probability samples of young people from five Balkan countries (N = 1046), we examined whether it is possible to transfer the effects of contact with other marginalized outgroups (largest ethnic minority in every country, Roma, the extremely poor and physically disabled) to acceptance of gays and lesbians (secondary outgroup), and whether this relationship could be explained by attitude generalization and increased intergroup trust. Path analyses supported the secondary transfer effect: it confirmed that, while controlling for direct contact, contact with other marginalized groups was related to more acceptance of a secondary group; this relationship was mediated by trust. This was found across all primary groups in the combined samples, while the effect varied for different groups in country samples. The results add to the value of intergroup contact as a mean of prejudice-reduction.

T1  - Countries and Cultural Differences in the Stigma of Mental Illness: The East–West Divide
AN  - 2380017811
AB  - Mental illness is a global public health crisis. Although rates of untreated cases stand as a primary problem, stigma is a significant obstacle. Yet, global differences in levels and roots of stigma remain poorly understood. Using the Stigma in Global Context–Mental Health Study (SGC-MHS) data, we analyzed data on two components of stigma—prejudice and discriminatory potential—attached to clinically diagnostic cases of depression and schizophrenia. We examined whether stigma was higher in the East than West. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the link between prejudice and discriminatory potential in the East was due, in part, to cultural differences in the attributions about mental illness. With SGC-MHS’ nationally representative vignette data from over 11,000 respondents in 11 relevant countries (four Eastern, seven Western), analyses replicated past research of higher levels of stigma and more moral attributions in Eastern countries, particularly for depression. Moreover, prejudice-related disclosure spillover concerns predicted discriminatory potential (social distance) in the East, but not the West; this was driven by a greater emphasis on moral attributions in the East. Finally, exploratory analyses found that Western respondents endorsed higher discrimination for minority (vs. majority) group members with mental illness. In Eastern countries, the same pattern emerged for schizophrenia, but the reverse occurred for depression—greater stigma for majority as compared with minority group members. Together, these findings suggest that cultural differences in the sources of prejudice and attributions about the etiology of mental illness contribute, at least in part, to global differences in the profile of stigma.

T1  - Support for National Flag‐Displays in Times of Change: A Question of National Identification?
AN  - 2323309643
AB  - Flag‐displays can be used within national groups to communicate majority supremacy over ethnic minorities. In two studies set in an Australian context (N = 88 and N = 102), we explain how mode of national identification (glorifying identifiers versus attached identifiers) differently predicts support for multicultural values and national flag‐displays. In line with the hypotheses, we found that attached identifiers were more supportive of multicultural values and national flag‐displays by ethnic minorities than glorifying identifiers. In contrast, glorifying identifiers supported flag‐displays by the majority more than did the attached identifiers. Study 2 demonstrates that glorifying identifiers’ use of the national flag is explicitly meant to exclude other groups. As expected, support for multicultural values and endorsement of the flag as an exclusion tool helped to explain the relationship between identification and flag‐displays. As such, results revealed the attitudes behind a novel form of prejudice that is currently on the rise.

T1  - Children’s and Adults’ Affectionate Generosity Toward Members of Different Religious Groups: PROD
AN  - 2310601359
AB  - This article examines children’s and adults’ willingness to give a nonmonetary resource—affection—to in-group versus out-group members. In a study of attitudes toward Christian, Jewish, and non-religious people, religious participants—children as well as adults—reported that the religious out-group member was more like them and more likeable than the non-religious character, despite the fact that both characters were members of an out-group. Non-religious participants did not distinguish between out-group characters in response to these questions. Although these patterns emerged among both children and adults, we also found that children reported more affection toward Christian characters than did adults. We discuss implications of the results for the study of generosity as well as for intergroup attitudes, religious cognition, and development.

T1  - Double standards? Attitudes towards immigrant and emigrant dual citizenship in the Netherlands
AN  - 2309190351
AB  - Despite increasingly liberal practices around the world, dual citizenship acceptance is still contested. Surprisingly, few studies exist on what drives public attitudes towards political membership in two or more states. Based on data from the 2012 Dutch Parliamentary Election Study (N = 1,677) we investigate the discrepancy in negative attitudes in the Netherlands towards dual citizenship of immigrants who acquire Dutch citizenship, on the one hand, and more positive attitudes towards Dutch citizens acquiring a foreign citizenship, on the other. We find that negative views of immigrant dual citizenship are associated with strong in-group identification and out-group derogation, whereas experiencing a sense of symbolic group threat is associated with negative views of both immigrant and emigrant dual citizenship.

T1  - Rethinking human-animal relations: The critical role of social psychology: GPIR
AN  - 2285045382
AB  - People deeply value their social bonds with companion animals, yet routinely devalue other animals, considering them mere commodities to satisfy human interests and desires. Despite the inherently social and intergroup nature of these complexities, social psychology is long overdue in integrating human-animal relations in its theoretical frameworks. The present body of work brings together social psychological research advancing our understanding of: 1) the factors shaping our perceptions and thinking about animals as social groups, 2) the complexities involved in valuing (caring) and devaluing (exploiting) animals, and 3) the implications and importance of human-animal relations for human intergroup relations. In this article, we survey the diversity of research paradigms and theoretical frameworks developed within the intergroup relations literature that are relevant, perchance critical, to the study of human-animal relations. Furthermore, we highlight how understanding and rethinking human-animal relations will eventually lead to a more comprehensive understanding of many human intergroup phenomena.

T1  - Meeting a nice asylum seeker: Intergroup contact changes stereotype content perceptions and associated emotional prejudices, and encourages solidarity‐based collective action intentions
AN  - 2265592849
AB  - Intergroup contact can improve majority members’ perception of minorities. Integrating the intergroup contact hypothesis with the stereotype content model and BIAS‐Map, we hypothesized that positive intergroup contact improves German majority members’ evaluations of asylum seekers on the warmth and competence dimensions. Using cross‐sectional survey data and structural equation modelling, we found support for this hypothesis (Study 1a, N = 182). Warmth and competence perceptions, in turn, predicted specific intergroup emotions (Study 1b, N = 255). A causal effect of intergroup contact on changes in stereotype content, emotions, and solidarity‐based collective action intentions as an important facilitative behavioural intention debated in the intergroup contact literature is established with experimental data (Study 2, N = 74). Participants interacting with an asylum seeker rated asylum seekers higher on warmth and specific intergroup emotions and were more supportive of solidarity‐based collective actions in favour of asylum seekers. Our study demonstrates that contact has differential effects on cognitive, affective, and behavioural components of prejudice towards asylum seekers that are systematically linked.

T1  - A test of positive and negative extended intergroup contact in a Chinese minority with perceived group norms and intergroup anxiety as mediators
AN  - 2253806274
AB  - This article is aimed to examine the effect of Uyghur's (minority group) positive and negative extended contact with Han (majority group) within the background of China. One affective (intergroup anxiety) and two cognitive (perceived in‐group and out‐group norms) variables were tested as potential mediators. A sample of 875 Uyghur minority college students ranging in age from 17 to 25 years completed self‐reported measures of direct contact, positive and negative extended contact, intergroup anxiety, perceptions of in‐group and out‐group norms, out‐group attitudes, and contact intentions. Results revealed that both positive and negative extended contact were associated with out‐group attitudes and contact intentions, over and above the effect of direct contact. The effects of both forms of extended contact were mediated by intergroup anxiety, perceived in‐group, and out‐group norms. Notably, positive extended contact exerted larger effects than negative extended contact. This research highlights the significance of considering both positive and negative extended contact and the potential of extended contact as a means to ameliorate intergroup relations from the perspective of minority groups.

T1  - Engendering support: Hostile sexism predicts voting for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election: GPIR
AN  - 2229907015
AB  - This research investigated the role of gender attitudes in the United States 2016 presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The results of three studies (combined N = 2,816) showed that, as expected, Trump voters were higher in hostile and benevolent sexism than were Clinton voters. Even after controlling for political ideology and gender (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and minority group attitudes (Study 3), greater hostile sexism predicted more positive attitudes toward Trump, less positive attitudes toward Clinton, and retrospective reports of having voted for Trump over Clinton (Studies 2 and 3). Benevolent sexism did not predict additional variation in voting behavior beyond political ideology and hostile sexism. These results suggest that political behavior is based on more than political ideology; even among those with otherwise progressive views, overtly antagonistic views of women could be a liability to women—and an asset to men—running for office.

T1  - Ethnic diversity, ethnic threat, and social cohesion: (re)-evaluating the role of perceived out-group threat and prejudice in the relationship between community ethnic diversity and intra-community cohesion
AN  - 2166693532
AB  - Research frequently demonstrates diverse communities exhibit lower intra-community cohesion. Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity's effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity's effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity's impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines.

T1  - Infrahumanization and Socio-Structural Variables: The Role of Legitimacy, Ingroup Identification, and System Justification Beliefs
AN  - 2158402043
AB  - As there is a robust tendency to support system-legitimizing beliefs by appealing to stereotypes or ideologies, we examined the role played by the perception of the status quo in relation to the infrahumanization bias. We compared this bias in high versus low-status group members and tested the mediating role of system justification beliefs and ingroup identification. The results of a moderated-mediated regression model (N = 238) showed that the perception of legitimacy of one’s own status had differential effects on the infrahumanization bias: The perception of legitimacy was positively associated with the endorsement of system justification beliefs and negatively associated with ingroup identification among low-status group members, whereas the perception of legitimacy was positively associated with ingroup identification among high-status group members. In both groups, ingroup identification was positively correlated with the tendency to infrahumanize the outgroup, while the endorsement of system justification beliefs was linked to the infrahumanization among low-status group members only. The findings highlight that the Social Identity Theory and the System Justification Theory can be fruitfully combined to explain infrahumanization tendencies.

T1  - Preface
AN  - 2325887301
AB  - In recent years, much progress has been made in the United States, Europe and beyond with regard to legislation that is supportive and protective of LGBT populations (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender persons). For example, in 2011 in the United States, the Institute of Medicine released the watershed monograph “The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People” (IOM 2011). In 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could legally marry in all 50 US states. Furthermore, US public opinion toward gay marriage changed dramatically in a relatively short amount of time. In Pew Research Center polling in 2004, Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a margin of 60% to 31%. By 2019, support for same-sex marriage had flipped with a majority of Americans (61%) supporting same-sex marriage, while 31% oppose it (Pew Research Center 2019). Most recently in the United States, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is undertaking a consensus study that will review the available data and future research needs on persons of diverse sexualities and genders. Also across Europe the legal situation of LGBT persons has improved over the past decades and their visibility has increased in various areas of society (Fischer 2019). Some basic LGBT rights in the European Union (EU) are protected under EU treaties and law. Same-sex sexual activity is legal in all EU Member States and discrimination in employment has been banned since 2000. However, EU Member States have different laws when it comes to any greater protection for same-sex civil unions, same-sex marriage and adoption rights of same-sex couples. For instance, during the last 20 years, legal protection against hate speech towards sexual minorities has increased from five to 23 countries in 2019 (ILGA 2019). With respect to marriage and family laws, same-sex marriage is currently legal in 16 European countries (Pew Research Center 2019). While in 2001, the Netherlands was the first European country to open marriage to same-sex couples, Austria became the latest European nation to legalize the practice at the beginning of 2019. The change in Austria’s marriage laws was prompted by its highest court, which in 2017 ruled that the country was discriminating against gay and lesbian couples by not granting them full marriage rights. Concerning the acceptance of same-sex marriage, however, European countries display a huge heterogeneity: with strong support in Sweden (88%), Denmark (86%), and the Netherlands (86%), and distinctly less support in post-socialist countries, such as Poland (32%) and Hungary (27%) (Pew Research Center 2019). Support of same-sex marriage is strongly correlated with acceptance of homosexuality (Hooghe and Meeusen 2013; Taka´cs et al. 2016) in Europe. For instance, acceptance of homosexuality increased much faster in countries where same-sex marriage is legal after those countries adopted same-sex relationship recognition policies (OECD 2019; Aksoy et al. 2018). While these achievements are laudable, it is important to keep evaluating to what extent structural obstacles to equality remain. A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) concluded that worldwide, LGBT people report widespread discrimination, are at greater risk for mental health disorders, and have worse labor market outcomes than non-LGBT people (OECD 2019). Yet, compared to research on other minority groups, sexual and gender minorities have been studied quantitatively much less in the social sciences, which in part is related to the numerous challenges associated with collecting suitable survey data (OECD 2019; Umberson et al. 2015).

T1  - The emotional costs of computers: an expectancy-value theory analysis of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority students' STEM attitudes
AN  - 2116068275
AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of 'emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a 'push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

T1  - The threat of increasing diversity: Why many White Americans support Trump in the 2016 presidential election: GPIR
AN  - 2087352971
AB  - What accounts for the widespread support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential race? This experiment demonstrates that the changing racial demographics of America contribute to Trump’s success as a presidential candidate among White Americans whose race/ethnicity is central to their identity. Reminding White Americans high in ethnic identification that non-White racial groups will outnumber Whites in the United States by 2042 caused them to become more concerned about the declining status and influence of White Americans as a group (i.e., experience group status threat), and caused them to report increased support for Trump and anti-immigrant policies, as well as greater opposition to political correctness. Increased group status threat mediated the effects of the racial shift condition on candidate support, anti-immigrant policy support, and opposition to political correctness. Among Whites low in ethnic identification, in contrast, the racial shift condition had no effect on group status threat or support for anti-immigrant policies, but did cause decreased positivity toward Trump and decreased opposition to political correctness. Group status threat did not mediate these effects. Reminders of the changing racial demographics had comparable effects for Democrats and Republicans. Results illustrate the importance of changing racial demographics and White ethnic identification in voter preferences and how social psychological theory can illuminate voter preferences.

T1  - An Experiment in Second Person Writing: Notes on a Partial Jewish Identity
AN  - 2071536254
AB  - Jewish people are a unique minority group identified through a religious belief system, a culture, and supposed biological traits. I describe myself here as a partial Jew, indicating my unique status parallels the identities of mixed race individuals who feel some other minority group members see them as like themselves but marginally or partially so, at times creating a double marginalization. Through my marginal identity, I encounter prejudice and discrimination from non-Jews and Jews alike. Taking cues from Claudia Rankine, I write examples of everyday identification, prejudice, and discrimination in the second person, in a style unique to sociology. I note my silences, responses, and thoughts about those encounters. I consider whether these everyday encounters constitute microaggressions, and what, then, I am, and you are, left with.

T1  - Exploring How National Politics Influences the Outcome of Intergroup Contact among Muslim Minority Members
AN  - 2025521481
AB  - This article adds to the existing research in intergroup contact among ethnic minority members by hypothesizing that national political debate has the capacity to enhance the positive outcomes of cross‐group interaction. Analyses show that the capacity of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice toward majority members is disproportionately stronger among Muslims than among non‐Muslim minority members. Specifically, at the time of data collection, the two categories—Muslims and majority members—were highly salient in the public debate, whereas the non‐Muslim minority member category was not primed as a contrast to the majority culture. The political debate most likely stimulated Muslims to generalize their positive contact experiences to the entire majority group. The analysis contributes to the theoretical refinement of the so‐called categorization model by focusing on politically induced reactions among contacted ethnic minority members toward majority members. The analysis utilizes a tailor‐made national sample (fielded during the Mohammad Cartoon Crisis in 2006) among ethnic minority members in Denmark (N = 3,272).

T1  - The psychology of social class: How socioeconomic status impacts thought, feelings, and behaviour
AN  - 2020475637
AB  - Drawing on recent research on the psychology of social class, I argue that the material conditions in which people grow up and live have a lasting impact on their personal and social identities and that this influences both the way they think and feel about their social environment and key aspects of their social behaviour. Relative to middle‐class counterparts, lower/working‐class individuals are less likely to define themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more likely to have interdependent self‐concepts; they are also more inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a result of having a lower sense of personal control. Working‐class people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to help others in distress. The widely held view that working‐class individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that highly educated people also express prejudice towards these groups when the latter are described as highly educated and therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middle‐class norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious workplaces makes working‐class people less likely to apply for positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make it less likely that working‐class individuals can benefit from educational and occupational opportunities to improve their material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits opportunities and threatens social cohesion.

T1  - Trajectories of Internalized Heterosexism among Young Men Who have Sex with Men
AN  - 2015614437
AB  - Minority stress, or the unique stressors encountered by sexual minorities, has a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of this population. One minority stressor, internalized heterosexism, refers to incorporating stigma against sexual minorities into one’s self-concept as a product of social bias. This minority stressor has been consistently related to worse mental health in sexual minorities. We evaluated experiences of internalized heterosexism longitudinally, over 24 months, in a sample of 450 young men who have sex with men (YMSM; age range = 16–20 years old at baseline). Latent class growth analyses revealed three classes: individuals with low-decreasing internalized heterosexism (57.1%), medium-stable internalized heterosexism (37.3%), and high-stable internalized heterosexism (5.6%). Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that some racial/ethnic minorities, non-gay identified individuals (i.e., bisexual/other), and individuals with less femininity and greater masculinity were significantly more likely to be in the medium- and high-stable internalized heterosexism classes. Higher victimization, as well as lower gay/bisexual community involvement, peer support, and outness predicted membership in the medium-stable internalized heterosexism class (relative to the low-decreasing class). Further, higher past 6-month victimization and lower outness were also predictive of high-stable internalized heterosexism class membership (relative to the low-decreasing class). These findings reveal that there is not a single trajectory of internalized heterosexism—the degree to which it changes differs across men and depends on demographic characteristics and interpersonal experiences. Furthermore, the results indicate interpersonal targets for future work aimed at promoting positive identity development and decreased internalized heterosexism for sexual minority youth.

T1  - The joint impact of collectivistic value orientation and independent self-representation on group creativity: GPIR
AN  - 1986135110
AB  - Which antecedents and group processes are beneficial to creativity in groups? Taking a component-based approach of individualism-collectivism (I-C), we proposed that the combination of collectivistic value orientation and independent self-representation of group members enhances group creativity. In an interactive group brainstorming experiment (N
 = 68 triads), we manipulated group members' value orientation and their self-representation via priming methods and examined group creativity using both a consensual and an objective measure of idea originality. Results indicated that groups generated ideas that are more original when members combined a collectivistic value orientation with independent self-representation than with interdependent self-representation. In contrast, differences in self-representation did not have a significant effect when an individualistic value orientation was activated. We also identified specific group processes characteristic of the predicted combinatorial effect: In creative groups, there was more open communication. Implications of these findings for research on group creativity and future directions are discussed.

T1  - A Preliminary Report on the Relationship Between Microaggressions Against Black People and Racism Among White College Students
AN  - 1951226644
AB  - Previous efforts to understand microaggressions have surveyed stigmatized group members’ experiences of receiving microaggressions. This report presents the first attempt to measure self-reported likelihood of delivering microaggressions rather than receiving microaggressions and to explore the association between the likelihood of delivering microaggressions and racial prejudice. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 33 black and 118 non-Hispanic white undergraduate students at a large public Southern/Midwest university. Black students reported the degree to which a series of statements would be experienced as microaggressive. White students reported their likelihood of delivering those statements and completed measures of racial prejudice. White students’ self-reported likelihood of engaging in microaggressive acts was significantly related to all measures of racial prejudice. The single item “A lot of minorities are too sensitive” was the strongest predictor of negative feelings toward black people. Results offer preliminary support that the delivery of microaggressions by white students is not simply innocuous behavior and may be indicative of broad, complex, and negative racial attitudes and explicit underlying hostility and negative feelings toward black students.

T1  - The Turks of Bulgaria: An Outlier Case of Forced Migration and Voluntary Return
AN  - 1938531634
AB  - The Turks of Bulgaria have a particular place in displacement scholarship. As the largest minority group in the country, they were subjected to ethnic cleansing in the 1980s. Anti-Turkish sentiments culminated in state-led systematic exclusion and more than 340,000 Turks were forcefully migrated to Turkey in 1989. After the collapse of Communism and the transition to democracy, almost 40 per cent of them voluntarily returned to Bulgaria, making it an outlier case in displacement literature. Drawing on 46 semi-structured interviews, this study contributes to the literature by offering a grounded conceptual framework which explains the macro-dynamics of voluntary and sustainable return through an in-depth study of the Bulgarian case. The findings suggest that three-factors account for the voluntary return: (i) the peaceful transition to inclusive democracy and power-sharing; (ii) the dual moderation between majority and minority representatives; and (iii) the enabling role of international actors, primarily the EU-anchor.

T1  - Same‐Ethnic, Interethnic, and Interracial Friendships Among Asian Early Adolescents
AN  - 2296042148
AB  - This study examined the psychological functions of three friendship types (i.e., same ethnic, interethnic, and interracial) in a sample of 785 sixth‐grade Asian students (Mage = 11.5 years). Participants listed their friends in sixth grade and whether each nominated friend was the same or a different ethnic group. They also reported on their ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and perceived school safety. Results showed that same‐ethnic friendships were related to stronger ethnic identity and interracial friendships were uniquely related to school safety. Interethnic friendships (an Asian friend from a different country of origin) when perceived as same ethnic functioned similarly to same‐ethnic friendships, whereas interethnic friendships perceived as from a different ethnic group, like interracial friendships, were associated with better intergroup relations. Implications for studying friendships in ethnically diverse samples are discussed.

T1  - Earnings of Immigrants in Traditional and Non-Traditional Destinations: A Case Study from Atlantic Canada
AN  - 1924201435
AB  - Despite growing interest in the regionalization of immigration, comparative studies of the labor market outcomes of immigrants in traditional and non-traditional destinations remain limited in Canada. Using Atlantic Canada as a non-traditional destination and drawing data from the 2006 Census of Population, this study compares the determinants of immigrant earnings in this region with those of three major traditional destinations, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver (MTV). Results indicate the returns to postgraduate degrees and foreign credentials on earnings are higher in Atlantic Canada than MTV, although the costs of being visible minorities and speaking non-official language(s) at home are not statistically different between the two destinations. Results also show the earning disparities linked to employment in ethnic businesses are smaller in Atlantic Canada. This paper discusses implications of these findings for immigrant settlement policy.

T1  - When shared group membership signifies shared subjective experience: I-sharing and the minimal group paradigm
AN  - 1900995644
AB  - Ingroup favoritism is pervasive. It emerges even in the minimal group paradigm, where participants are assigned to novel groups based on seemingly insignificant characteristics. Yet many of the grouping schemes used in minimal group research may imply something significant: namely, that ingroup members will share in-the-moment subjective experience, or I-share. Two studies examine the role of inferred I-sharing in the minimal group paradigm. We found that (1) people inferred that they would I-share with ingroup members more than outgroup members; (2) inferred I-sharing increased ingroup favoritism; and (3) inferred I-sharing accounted for this ingroup favoritism. Moreover, expecting to I-share with the outgroup improved participants' attitudes toward the outgroup. These results converge with other research suggesting that people favor ingroup members, in part, because they expect to I-share with them.

T1  - The relationship between osteoporosis and body composition in pre- and postmenopausal women from different ethnic groups in China
AN  - 1878812089
AB  - Objective: To investigate the ethnic differences in osteoporosis (OP) and body composition (BC) and their relationship in the Maonan, Mulam, Hmong, and Yao minorities in China.
Design: A total of 860 Maonan, Mulam, Hmong, and Yao women were included in this cross-sectional study. Demographic, health history, and lifestyle information was collected using questionnaires. BC was measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis, and bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed via calcaneal quantitative ultrasound.
Results: Compared with premenopausal women, postmenopausal women exhibited a lower fat-free mass (FFM), muscle mass (MM), limb muscle mass, and T-score but a higher waist-to-hip ratio and prevalence of OP in each minority (p < .05). After adjustment for age, Hmong women displayed the highest body mass index, fat mass, percentage of body fat, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat contents, while Yao women presented the highest T-scores and lowest prevalence of OP among the four minorities (p < .05). Having a greater number of children and an older age were significant risk factors for OP in all ethnic groups (p < .05, OR > 1). In addition, our results revealed that FFM and MM exhibited exactly the same weak positive relationship with the T-score (r = 0.081, p < .05) after adjusting for menopausal status and age in all of the participants. Furthermore, significant ethnic differences in the relationship between BC and the T-score existed in the four minorities studied here.
Conclusions: BC and OP prevalence varied by menopausal status and ethnic group, and ethnic-specific relationships between BC and BMD were present in the four minorities. More research is needed to further investigate the ethnic differences in BC, OP, and risk factors for lower BMD to develop targeted prevention strategies to reduce the burden of OP across different ethnic groups in China.

T1  - Ethnic elders and pension protection in the United Kingdom
AN  - 1884652000
AB  - Pension receipt in later life is determined by the way in which individuals' pension contributions and circumstances over the lifecourse interact with eligibility rules. Within the British context, such pensions relate to sources such as the State Pension, an occupational or private pension, and Pension Credit. Existing research shows that membership of certain ethnic groups is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving occupational or private pensions. Data from Understanding Society allows us to build on existing evidence by examining the factors associated with the receipt of three different kinds of pension income - State, occupational/private and Pension Credit - among older men and women from separate Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) groups. The results show that belonging to certain BME groups reduces one's chances of receiving the State Pension or an occupational/private pension, but increases the chance of receiving Pension Credit. The gender-specific analysis shows that these results hold true for many BME groups of men, whereas among women, only Pakistani women are less likely than White British women to receive an occupational/private pension. Such findings provide up-to-date empirical evidence that ethnic inequalities in pension protection are still evident and contribute to the increasingly important debate in the United Kingdom and elsewhere regarding migrants' social security and welfare over the lifecourse and in later life.

T1  - Patterns of criminal threat in television news coverage of ethnic minorities in Flanders (2003-2013)
AN  - 2076970393
AB  - Despite a strong cognitive association in the minds of native citizens between ethnic minority presence and crime, compelling evidence demonstrating a real-world relationship between crime and ethnic diversity is limited. This study adopts a media-based approach to contribute to the debate on the origin of the perception of criminal threats. By means of a content analysis of 11 years of crime news (2003-2013) in Flanders (the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), portrayals of ethnic minority and majority perpetrators are systematically compared to assess whether ethnic minorities are portrayed in a significantly more threatening way. Moreover, building on ethnic hierarchy theories, comparisons are made between various outgroups. Findings demonstrate that ethnic minority perpetrators are depicted in a more threatening manner: they are more likely to be associated with violent, property, and gang-related crime. Additionally, they are more likely to be anonymised and to be associated with explicit manifestations of threat. Group differences exist, however, as the most distant outgroup (i.e. North Africans) is covered in a more threatening way than the other outgroups. Implications for intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - The Great Recession and Group-Based Control: Converting Personal Helplessness into Social Class In-Group Trust and Collective Action
AN  - 1878222820
AB  - Economic crises can threaten individuals' sense of control. At the same time, these crises often result in collective responses, such as class-based protest (e.g., the 99%), but also nationalism or xenophobia. We investigated how personal consequences of economic crises lead to both intragroup and intergroup responses and the role of control for these effects. Studies 1 and 2 show that personal income and fear of economic descent reduce people's personal control, which, in turn, fosters hostile interethnic attitudes (Study 1), and in-group trust toward one's own social class (Study 2). Study 3 tests the combined effect of personal control and salience of collective economic identity in an experimental field study in Germany and Spain. For Spanish participants, control deprivation increased collective efficacy when national economic identity was salient, which, in turn, increased collective action intentions. We discuss the conditions under which crisis-induced threat to personal control elicits collective responses and the consequences for intergroup relations, including across class lines.

T1  - PIMP THE MISSION TO PUSH THE MARGIN: CHARITABLE PROGRAMS AS RACIAL PROJECTS
AN  - 2119846486
AB  - This study examines how health care administrators perceive Spanish-speaking immigrant growth in a city with little history of attracting immigrants. As prior research on new destination communities reveals, there is often a need to adjust various institutions, organizations, and policies to meet the needs of newer immigrant groups, but these new host communities are often ill-equipped to deal with the structural and social changes necessary to serve immigrant newcomers. Through semi-structured interviews, this study investigates the ways one health care system's administrators frame the institution's role and response to the surrounding city's transformation into a new destination for Spanish-speaking immigrants. Administrators link the needs of Spanish-speaking patients to the health system's community outreach department (the Mission Department), reinforcing cultural representations of this particular group as "indigent" with needs that fall outside the mainstream services offered by the health care system. Furthermore, administrators are found to conflate race with class in a reciprocal process that pushes Spanishspeaking patients out of the main hospital system into auxiliary charitable services, negatively impacting the quality of health care provided to Spanishspeaking patients.

T1  - Do white voters support welfare policies targeted at ethnic minorities? Experimental evidence from Britain
AN  - 2076970671
AB  - Academics and policymakers have begun discussing ethnically focussed policies to offset the penalties ethnic minorities suffer due to discrimination, but little is known about how such policies would be received by the public. We employ new survey experiments fielded in Britain to examine public reactions to equal opportunity policies targeted at working class, black or Muslim Britons, and redistributive policies aiming to reduce inequality between the rich and the poor or between whites and ethnic minorities. We find widespread support for class- or income-targeted policies among white British respondents, but much lower support when identical policies are ethnically targeted. We find evidence for two mechanisms which help to explain this drop in support. Firstly, political and ideological values such as egalitarianism and support for an active state strongly predict support for class- and income-targeted policy, but have a much weaker effect on support for ethnically targeted policy. Secondly, hostility to immigrants has a strong negative effect on support for ethnically targeted policy, but no effect on support for class- and income-targeted policy. The combination of intense opposition from anti-immigrant voters and indifference from traditionally pro-welfare left wingers results in very little public support for explicitly ethnically targeted policy.

T1  - Diverse Outcomes: Social Citizenship and the Inclusion of Skilled Migrants in Australia
AN  - 1908433856
AB  - The sociology of citizenship is concerned with the social and economic conditions of citizens of a national community. Drawing on T. H. Marshall's contribution to the theory of social citizenship this article argues that some groups of migrants and ethnic minorities in Australia, particularly those from non-British and European Backgrounds, face a number of social and institutional barriers which prevent them from reaching their full potential as members of Australia's multicultural community. Evidence from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data shows different socioeconomic outcomes for migrants from British and European backgrounds compared with migrants from Asian backgrounds, despite having similar educational qualifications and length of time living in Australia. As such, it is argued that achieving social membership and inclusion continues to be a struggle for particular groups of migrants. A deeper commitment to the core principles of citizenship that is beyond mere notions of formal equality is needed if Australia is to address this important social issue.

T1  - Backlash
AN  - 1851015856
AB  - Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

T1  - Getting Ahead: Educational and Occupational Trajectories of the 'New' Second-Generation in Switzerland
AN  - 1830616454
AB  - This paper examines the educational and occupational trajectories among second-generation immigrants of Turkish and Western-Balkan origin in Switzerland. Using a representative sample of 1107 respondents in two Swiss urban areas, the findings reveal that descendants of immigrants have reduced chances to follow a constant successful path from education to occupation, which is mainly determined by parental socioeconomic status. However, young adults of Turkish and Western Balkan origin are significantly more often upward mobile than the majority group, a pattern that is robust against a range of controls. We find parental monitoring and family cohesion to be positively related with upward mobility. Moreover, second-generation immigrants are more likely to be upwardly mobile than starting high in the education system but subsequently moving downwards--a profile that is more frequent among Swiss origin youth. Our multivariate results indicate that a lack of intense parent-child communication and perceived discrimination in school are affecting this downward process.

T1  - "BUT AREN'T WE ALL POOR?" HOW WHITES' PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC GROUP THREAT INFLUENCE RACIAL ATTITUDES IN MICHIGAN
AN  - 1836863641
AB  - This paper presents a test of the power threat hypothesis (Blalock 1967) through an investigation of the role that whites ' perceptions of economic conditions have on their racial attitudes. This relationship is analyzed using data from Michigan 's State of the State Survey in 2009 when economic conditions were fairly had. Findings support the power threat hypothesis and demonstrate that whites who had more negative perceptions of their own or community financial status were more likely to have negative racial attitudes. Additionally, education and political affiliation were found to he important factors in mediating the relationship between whites ' perceptions of economic conditions and racial attitudes, with conservative, less educated whites exhibiting more negative racial attitudes than liberal more educated whites. These findings suggest a need for future research examining if and why marginalized whites invest in symbolic racial privilege at the expense of their own economic realities.

AN  - 1818405273
AB  - This article analyzes the transmedia strategies of three ethnic minority activist organizations in the Philippines: Cordillera Peoples Alliance, Tebtebba, and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. The fieldwork entailed interviews with leaders of these organizations and their media teams, scholars who study these movements, and social commentators. The analysis shows the complexities of identity construction in the age of spreadable media and the importance of transmedia literacy for activists who have to navigate these complexities to effectively advance their cause.

T1  - Perceived accountability and public attitudes toward local police
AN  - 1799574226
AB  - Recent national events have brought the issue of police-community relations into the public eye. Even though a large body of academic research exists on the predictors of public attitude toward police, very little is known about how public perceptions of police accountability influence satisfaction with the police. This study seeks to fill that gap by using ordered logistic regression and multi-year community-level survey data from one Western city (n = 3725) to examine the relationship between satisfaction with police accountability and overall attitudes toward the police. The results indicate that respondent satisfaction with police accountability was a strong, consistent predictor of satisfaction with local police, even after controlling for other important variables, such as race/ethnicity and community context. The findings suggest that public perceptions relating to the control of police officer conduct should be considered when assessing the predictors of attitudes toward the police.

T1  - Effects of trustors' social identity complexity on interpersonal and intergroup trust
AN  - 1799121726
AB  - Although previous literature has revealed the effect of a single social identity on trust, only few studies have examined how multiple social identities affect trust in others. The present research examined the effects of trustors' social identity complexity on their level of trust toward another person (interpersonal trust), outgroup members (outgroup trust), and ingroup members (ingroup trust). Study 1, which was a correlational study, indicated that trustors' social identity complexity was positively related to their interpersonal and outgroup trust. Three experimental studies were performed to identify causal relationships. Study 2 found that activating trustors' high social identity complexity produced high levels of interpersonal trust, and Studies 3 and 4 found that this effect was more pronounced when the trustee was an outgroup member (outgroup trust) rather than an ingroup member (ingroup trust). The implications of these results for social harmony are discussed.

T1  - Psychological antecedents and motivational models of collective action: examining the role of perceived effectiveness in political protest participation
AN  - 1787041749
AB  - The present study examines Hong Kong citizens' willingness to participate in the Occupy Central/Umbrella Movement. A representative adult survey (N = 816) was conducted before the Occupy Central protest in 2014. Regression analyses showed that the core psychological antecedents of political identity (psychological attachment to pro-democracy parties and Occupy activists), political efficacy (perceived effectiveness of individual and movement agency), ideology (dissatisfaction with the pace of democratization), and emotion (anger with the political environment) were significant predictors of likely participation. Measures of perceived effectiveness of the Occupy movement to achieve successful outcomes (i.e. its ability to influence public opinion, strengthen the pro-democracy cause in Hong Kong, and facilitate opinion expression) explained additional variance even after controlling for demographics and the core antecedents. An integrated motivational model of collective action was then tested using structural equation modeling. Findings are consistent with the extant literature. Moral convictions (democracy as a fundamental human value) served as an antecedent of identity, efficacy, ideology, and anger, while identity exhibited direct and indirect effects on participation through efficacy, ideology and anger. The model also pointed to a role for perceived effectiveness, supporting the idea that individuals are motivated by other potential outcomes of a protest beyond achieving its primary objective.

T1  - Neighbourhood Effects and Pension Protection among Ethnic Minorities in England and Wales
AN  - 1813616250
AB  - Ethnic minorities are concentrated in particular geographical areas in England and Wales. Neighbourhood effects, such as the concentration of individuals from particular ethnic groups and levels of local deprivation, can impact upon the labour market performance of ethnic minorities and thus may affect individuals' pension protection. This paper examines the neighbourhood effect on pension protection for ethnic minorities in England and Wales using the wave 1 (January 2009-March 2011) dataset of the Understanding Society linked with a range of neighbourhood characteristics from the 2011 UK Census. Results from multilevel logistic models highlight that in addition to the effect of individual characteristics on patterns of pension protection, the level of concentration of own-ethnic-group individuals is significantly negatively correlated with a range of key indicators associated with pension protection such as being in paid employment, being an employee, and working for an employer who offers a pension scheme. However, the concentration of one's own ethnic group has no significant effect on the likelihood of being a member of an employer's pension scheme after controlling for other factors. Living in a deprived neighbourhood is negatively correlated with one's likelihood to be in paid employment or being self-employed. Furthermore, individuals are less likely to be members of an employer's pension scheme if they live in highly deprived neighbourhoods. © 2015 The Authors. Population, Space and Place.

T1  - Constructing and communicating an ethical consumer identity: A Social Identity Approach
AN  - 1808601362
AB  - In recent years the adoption of ethical criteria when making consumer decisions has gained increasing popularity and has been studied as a way of moving towards a more sustainable consumption-production paradigm. Much research has focused on what motivates people to engage in ethical consumer behaviours considered as the expression of an ethical self. However, there is a limited understanding of the construction and communication of these ethical selves. By focusing on how members of Spanish "Responsible Consumption Cooperatives" construct and communicate their ethical identities, this study sheds light on the underlying social psychological processes of ethical consumer behaviour from a Social Identity Approach. Findings from the multi-method qualitative study reveal how consumers negotiate their perceptions of ethics and respective behaviours through the construction and identification of in-groups and out-groups and communicate their shared social identity through different consumption practices, such as the deliberate avoidance of brands/symbols that embody the values of the consumerist society.

T1  - When do high and low status group members support confrontation? The role of perceived pervasiveness of prejudice
AN  - 1773420692
AB  - This paper examines how perceived pervasiveness of prejudice differentially affects high and low status group members' support for a low status group member who confronts. In Experiment 1 (N = 228), men and women read a text describing sexism as rare or as pervasive and subsequently indicated their support for a woman who confronted or did not confront a sexist remark. Experiment 2 (N = 324) specified the underlying process using a self-affirmation manipulation. Results show that men were more supportive of confrontation when sexism was perceived to be rare than when it was pervasive. By contrast, women tended to prefer confrontation when sexism was pervasive relative to when it was rare. Personal self-affirmation decreased men's and increased women's support for confrontation when prejudice was rare, suggesting that men's and women's support for confrontation when prejudice is rare is driven by personal impression management considerations. Implications for understanding how members of low and high status groups respond to prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Alignment with globalized Western culture: Between inclusionary values and an exclusionary social identity
AN  - 1782205680
AB  - Reactions to globalized Western culture (GWC) are influential in shaping intergroup relations and social issues worldwide. GWC is conceptualized here as an inclusionary cultural value system but a simultaneously exclusionary social identity. Whereas GWC's inclusive values may promote the civil liberties and fair treatment of gay people, for instance, as a social identity, groups may use their alignment with GWC to buttress ingroup superiority over less aligned outgroups. Three studies (one correlational and two experimental in design) probe these opposing vectors in samples of Jewish-Israelis, who are generally highly aligned with GWC. Results demonstrate that GWC alignment is associated with decreased anti-gay prejudice (Studies 2 and 3) but exclusionary responses towards Arab individuals and groups (Studies 1, 2, and 3), who are perceived to be less aligned with GWC. Conducted during the 2014 Israeli-Palestinian war, Study 3 notably demonstrated that a GWC identification prime reduced Jewish-Israelis' willingness to offer humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in need. This may suggest that in some contexts, GWC's divisive function as a social identity supersedes its more inclusionary humanistic values. These contrary effects of GWC alignment by social target are discussed, alongside their implications on national, regional, and international levels.

T1  - Prejudice in person memory: Self-threat biases memories of stigmatized group members
AN  - 1782205211
AB  - The present research investigated whether self-threat biases memory via retrieval-induced forgetting. Results show that people under self-threat whose goal is to restore their self-worth by making prejudicial judgments that deprecate others are more likely to exhibit an enhanced RIF effect for positive items and a reduced RIF for negative items ascribed to a stereotyped target (i.e., homosexual). Overall, the present findings are consistent with the view that motivation can affect the magnitude of RIF effects in person memory and that, in turn, they can serve as mechanisms for justifying desired conclusions.

T1  - Promoting Ethnic Entrepreneurship in European Cities: Sometimes Ambitious, Mostly Absent, Rarely Addressing Structural Features
AN  - 1755932742
AB  - An increasing number of immigrants have become entrepreneurial and many governments expect or hope that the ongoing rise of ethnic entrepreneurship will contribute significantly to the integration of immigrants, to their upward mobility, and to the economic development of the city of residence. In this article we explore the rules, regulations and policy interventions that shape self-employment trajectories in general and those of immigrant ethnic minorities in particular. The article is based on a general inventory of measures to promote ethnic entrepreneurship in 32 European countries, and a somewhat deeper inventory of policies and interventions in 28 European cities. We came across all kinds of measures and interventions and identified certain patterns, but the most striking finding was that such explicit measures and interventions were actually thin on the ground. We conclude this article with a discussion of the structural determinants of this outcome.

T1  - The European Struggle to Educate and Include Roma People: A Critique of Differences in Policy and Practice in Western and Eastern EU Countries
AN  - 1778778018
AB  - Multiculturalism is an established feature of the UK and other European States since the establishment of the Treaty of Rome in 1959. Enlargement has brought EU membership from six (1952) to twenty eight members since its foundation, and allowed free migration across its borders. However, many countries, in spite of agreements to adhere to 'democratic' practices, deny minority citizens their full rights, particularly in education contexts. Some recent accession EU States have education systems that are less adaptive to expected policy responsibilities. It is a more unstable aspect of Eastern Europe because of the failure of many of these countries to reduce social and educational inequalities and to establish rights for minority groups, particularly the Roma. An educational focus is used as a platform to highlight issues re the segregation, and discrimination against, Roma children in Europe, typically through the use of special education, which is not suitable for them. Europe generally, both East and West has failed to fully integrate the Roma. Often, institutional blame is placed on Roma communities, rather than situate them socially and economically due to ingrained structural inequalities. Stereotyped categories are often used to 'label' them. Countries with high Roma populations, four in Western and five in Eastern Europe are evaluated and compared in relation to the education of Roma children.

T1  - Online discussion, politicized identity, and collective action: GPIR
AN  - 1752001007
AB  - Although online discussions may stimulate political participation, little is known about how computer-mediated communication among members of political groups contributes to develop their politicized identity, thus indirectly stimulating collective action. Two studies involving activists from two web-based social movements investigated how online discussions moderate the effects of collective efficacy, group-based anger, and moral obligation on politicized identity. Self-reported frequency of online discussions and activists' perceptions of two content-related characteristics of online discussions both interacted with collective efficacy and moral obligation beliefs in predicting politicized identity. Politicized identity mediated the effects of these interactions on collective action intention. We discuss how specific characteristics of online political discussions may contribute to politicize group identity via group-level and individual-level paths.

T1  - Engendering Identity: Toward a Clearer Conceptualization of Gender as a Social Identity
AN  - 1732538427
AB  - Wood and Eagly ( 2015 ) make a valuable contribution to the understanding of gender psychology by reviewing how gender identity has been conceptualized in different literatures. But beyond comparing and contrasting these two traditions in North American and Western European samples, we advocate for more clarity in how gender identity is defined and theorized to relate to personality traits. In this commentary, we favor reserving the term gender identity for one's gender-relevant self-categorization and outline three main reasons why traits such as agency and communion should not be conflated with gender identity: (a) They are universal dimensions of human behavior that (b) can be decoupled from gender, and (c) when linked to gender exacerbate gender differences in these traits. Broader theoretical models, such as balanced identity theory, can improve understanding of when and why gender identity becomes associated with certain traits to inform self-definition. Although the process by which gender identity becomes linked to certain traits is assumed to be universal, the content of these linkages can be culturally and temporally specific. We suggest that traits become conflated with gender identity when they are endorsed by a gender group and differentiate one gender from the other. This process can lead to active avoidance of a trait by those who feel their gender identity is incompatible with that trait. In sum, we believe there is value in drawing on broader theories of self, identity, and social groups to best understand how people come to define themselves and are defined by gender.

T1  - Prevalence and Impact of Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Among an Ethnic Minority Population
AN  - 1723012425
AB  - The present study examined the prevalence of lifetime experiences of physical and psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) among members of the Turkish ethnic minority population in Flanders. In addition, this study explored how lifetime IPV victimization affects ethnic minority victims' current mental, relational, and sexual well-being. Using a population-based representative sample, data from 392 adult Turkish women and men were investigated. Lifetime experiences of physical violence were reported by 14.3% of the Turkish respondents, while 66.0% reported at least one incidence of psychological abuse. Women were much more likely than men to report physical IPV victimization, but no gender differences were found for psychological IPV. With regard to the impact of IPV, it was found that lifetime IPV experiences do not appear to affect victims' current mental health. However, higher levels of physical and/or psychological IPV victimization were related to increased levels of relationship dissatisfaction, anxious and avoidant attachment orientations, sexual dissatisfaction, sexual dysfunction (with distress), and to decreased levels of sexual communication. These adverse relational and sexual outcomes of IPV victimization were mainly present among women but were also, to a lesser degree, relevant for men.

T1  - The threat of moral transgression: The impact of group membership and moral opportunity
AN  - 1735657211; 201536821
AB  - When other ingroup members behave immorally, people's motivation to maintain a moral group image may cause them to experience increased threat and act defensively in response. In the current research, we investigated people's reactions to others' misconduct and examined the effect of group membership and the possible threat-reducing function of moral opportunity-the prospect of being able to re-establish the group's moral image. In Study 1, students who were confronted with fellow students' plagiarism and who received an opportunity to improve their group's morality reported feeling less threatened than students who did not receive such opportunity. In Study 2, students reacted to a recent academic fraud case, which either implicated an ingroup (scholar in their own discipline) or an outgroup member (scholar in another discipline). Results indicated that participants experienced more threat when an ingroup (versus an outgroup) member had committed the moral transgression. However, as hypothesized, this was not the case when moral opportunity was provided. Hence, the threat-reducing effect of moral opportunity was replicated. Additionally, participants generally were more defensive in response to ingroup (versus outgroup) moral failure and less defensive when moral opportunity was present (versus absent). Together, these findings suggest that the reduction of threat due to moral opportunity may generally help individuals take constructive action when the behavior of fellow group members discredits the group's moral image.

T1  - A longitudinal examination of the effects of self perceived leader-member dyadic communication differentiation and perceived group member performance: Does ethnicity make a difference?
AN  - 1762012268
AB  - This study investigated the notion that ethnicity similarity/dissimilarity and leader-member dyadic communication differentiation at several different points of time effect group member's performance. Longitudinal data from 4 studies on 141 matching dyads in 28 group's projects were used. Both leader's and member's perceptions on dyadic communication was assessed at three points (Time 1, 2 and 3) and used to predict group leader's perceived ratings of performance in Time 4 during groups' life cycles. Results of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses indicate that the effect for leader-member dyadic communication differentiation and the dyads ethnicity similarity only occurs near the end of the group's lifecycle. These findings show that effects for leader-member dyadic communication differentiation on group member performance differ depending on the ethnicity of the dyads to which they belong at what point in the group's lifecycle dyadic communication is assessed. Results showed that such effects are distinct at the later stage of the group development.

T1  - Collective Action and Social Change: Examining the Role of Representation in the Communication between Protesters and Third-party Members
AN  - 1728660294; 201533910
AB  - Within social psychology, it has been proposed that to understand how collective action creates social change, it is relevant to examine the role that other members of society can have on it. However, few studies have empirically examined that. We argue that for that task, it is useful, first, and as some authors have already argued, to go beyond the sole analysis of the two-sided inter-group relations creating collective action; and second, to articulate this with contributions from social representations theory, which recognises that to understand social change, we need to examine communicative practices, or how communication is used between collective action's actors and other actors to re-present identities. We analyse the protests by a movement of residents from a Lisbon neighbourhood that protested against the transformation of a neighbourhood's convent. Besides discussing this transformation with local authorities and failing to achieve its aims through that, the protesters also discussed it with other citizens. The analysis of this debate shows that the arguments and actions they used change throughout time, from local to global, as the latter were the ones more endorsed by other citizens and thus those that could help the protesters to achieve their goals.

T1  - Racial Identity and Intergroup Attitudes: A Multiracial Youth Analysis
AN  - 1708525571; 201529823
AB  - Objective This article examines the racial identity attitudes of white, black, and Hispanic youth and explores how these identities shape their feelings toward various racial and ethnic groups (whites, blacks, Asians, Hispanics, Arabs, and biracial individuals). Methods Using the 2005 Youth Culture Survey data set, we test our theoretical expectations using descriptive statistics and multiple regression models. Results The relationship between racial identification and out-group attitudes varies among racial groups; specifically, racial identity variables do not have a significant impact on whites' out-group attitudes, but they do matter for blacks and Hispanics. Conclusion While American society has changed in many ways (i.e., increased number of minorities and more tolerance, or at least more discussion of acceptance, for racial groups), our research finds that race still plays a consequential role in the lives of young racial minorities.

T1  - EFFECTS OF SOCIAL ANXIETY AND GROUP MEMBERSHIP OF POTENTIAL AFFILIATES ON SOCIAL RECONNECTION AFTER OSTRACISM
AN  - 1788495510
AB  - After being ostracized, people would try to socially reconnect with others. However, people high in social anxiety (HSA) might be more unwilling to reconnect with new affiliates than people low in social anxiety because HSA individuals are more pessimistic and fear about the interaction with others. Particularly, it might be more difficult for HSA individuals to reconnect with outgroup members. As a result, HSA ostracized participants showed a greater desire to reconnect with ingroup members than with outgroup members. When social anxiety was low, there was no difference in desire to reconnect with ingroup and outgroup members.

T1  - Socially relevant ethnic groups, ethnic structure, and AMAR
AN  - 1680153270; 201513895
AB  - Protracted conflicts over the status and demands of ethnic and religious groups have caused more instability and loss of human life than any other type of local, regional, and international conflict since the end of World War II. Yet we still have accumulated little in the way of accepted knowledge about the ethnic landscape of the world. In part this is due to empirical reliance on the limited data in the Minorities at Risk (MAR) project, whose selection biases are well known. In this article we tackle the construction of a list of 'socially relevant' ethnic groups meeting newly justified criteria in a dataset we call AMAR (A for All). We find that one of the principal difficulties in constructing the list is determining the appropriate level of aggregation for groups. To address this issue, we enumerate subgroups of the commonly recognized groups meeting our criteria so that scholars can use the subgroup list as one reference in the construction of the list of ethnic groups most appropriate for their study. Our conclusion outlines future work on the data using this expanded dataset on ethnic groups. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Color of Their Collar: Effects of Social Status Portrayal in Advertising on Self-Esteem
AN  - 1667946837; 201510449
AB  - The social identity framework suggests that exposure to high-status ingroup or low-status outgroup portrayals enhances self-esteem through positive ingroup distinctiveness. In this study, the effects of racial group portrayals in print advertisements on Blacks' and Whites' self-esteem and advertising responses were investigated in an experiment. A series of mock ads were pretested and developed manipulating character race (Black, White) and social status (high-status, low-status), resulting in four conditions. Blacks higher in ethnic identity reported enhanced self-esteem when exposed to lower-status White characters (negative outgroup portrayal), whereas Blacks lower in ethnic identity reported enhanced self-esteem when exposed to higher-status Black characters (positive ingroup portrayal). Advertising outcome measures (attitude toward the ad, purchase intentions) also revealed that level of ethnic identity moderates responses by Black subjects. White subjects reported lower self-esteem after exposure to lower-status Black characters. White participant responses suggest Blacks are not viewed as a competing outgroup, whereas Black participant responses indicate Blacks do not respond to race or social status in advertising uniformly, but rather their level of ethnic identity moderates self-esteem and attitudinal responses to ingroup and outgroup portrayals.

T1  - Interethnic attitudes in urban neighbourhoods: The impact of neighbourhood disorder and decline
AN  - 1708527530; 201529225
AB  - Previous studies of the relationship between interethnic attitudes and the ethnic composition of neighbourhoods have overlooked the impact of neighbourhood problems in ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. This paper examines the influence of neighbourhood disorder and decline (i.e. increasing disorder) on interethnic attitudes, controlling for the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Neighbourhood disorder and decline are measured by indicators of social and physical neighbourhood problems. Additionally, we examine the extent to which the impact of (increasing) disorder on interethnic attitudes depends on the particular ethnic composition of the neighbourhood. Using a geocoded data set covering 1435 neighbourhoods in The Netherlands, we analyse interethnic attitudes among four ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch population. Multilevel analyses show that for both ethnic minority and native Dutch residents neighbourhood decline is associated with negative attitudes towards ethnic minority groups, particularly in neighbourhoods with many ethnic minority residents.

T1  - Social identity and differences in psychological and economic outcomes for mixed and sole-identified Maori
AN  - 1559007758; 201432125
AB  - Maori are the indigenous peoples of New Zealand and are culturally and ethnically diverse. Previous research suggests that Maori who identify jointly as European (New Zealand's dominant group) may have improved employment outcomes, income and levels of education relative to those who identify solely as Maori. However, research exploring the broader constellation of factors linked to multiple versus sole-ethnic affiliation for Maori remains scarce. We examine differences in outcomes for Maori depending upon their single versus multiple ethnic affiliation as Maori, Maori/European, or European (but with Maori ancestry) in a national probability sample (N = 1416). Results indicated that people who identified jointly at Maori/European expressed political attitudes more aligned with Europeans. However, while Maori/Europeans may be more aligned with other Europeans in terms of support for mainstream political parties and intergroup attitudes, they remained lower on various indicators of social and economic status. In this latter regard, Maori/Europeans reported outcomes more similar to their sole-Maori counterparts. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The downsides of national identification for minority groups in intergroup conflicts in assimilationist societies
AN  - 1541997945; 201426781
AB  - The current study considered the downsides of national identification for minority groups in intergroup conflicts in assimilationist societies. This study examined how, in the Turkish national context, the national and ethnic identifications of ethnic Turks (N = 103) and ethnic Kurds (N = 58) predict construals (i.e., conflict frames, attributions of responsibility, and severity of harm) of Turkish-Kurdish conflict. The results indicated that, across groups, a shared national identification was associated with similar conflict construals in line with the official Turkish narrative, whereas ethnic identification was associated with opposing conflict construals that might help maintain the conflict. However, the conflict narrative related to national identification might produce a shared understanding of the conflict (i.e., more intergroup harmony) at the cost of neglecting the minority group's grievances in the conflict and legitimizing the status-quo, thus hindering efforts to enhance the minority group's disadvantaged status.

T1  - Public attitudes regarding individual and structural discrimination: Two sides of the same coin?
AN  - 1692289575; 201523330
AB  - Public attitudes and beliefs are relevant to both individual and structural discrimination. They are a reflection of cultural conceptions of mental illness that form a reality that people must take into account when they enact behavior and policy makers must confront when making decisions. Understanding and keeping track of these attitudes is critical to understanding individual and structural discrimination. Theories of stigma posit that both forms of discrimination are distinct phenomena. Practically nothing is known about how attitudes regarding individual and structural discrimination relate. Our study addresses this gap by examining how attitudes toward allocating financial resources to the care of people with depression (structural discrimination) have developed over the last decade in Germany, compared to the public's desire for social distance from these people (individual discrimination). Previous studies have shown the public being more ready to accept cutbacks for the care for mentally ill persons than for medically ill persons. These preferences could have changed with regard to depression, since there is a growing awareness among the German public of an 'epidemic of depression'. The idea of a high prevalence of depression may have led to a heightened perception of personal susceptibility for this disorder, making the public become more reluctant to accept cutbacks for the care of people with depression. On the other hand, there is reason to assume that the growing awareness of high prevalence of depression among the general public has not affected individual discrimination of persons suffering from this disorder. The two assumptions were tested comparing data from population surveys conducted in Germany in 2001 and 2011. Within ten years, the proportion of respondents who opposed cutting money from depression treatment tripled from 6% to 21%. In contrast, the public's desire for social distance from persons with depression remained unchanged. Moreover, both trends proved to be independent from each other. Our findings suggest that attitudes relevant to structural and individual discrimination are not necessarily linked together and may lead to divergent results. This means that a comprehensive understanding of stigma must consider both forms of discriminating attitudes together. Studying both simultaneously may deepen our understanding of each and point to novel ways to produce change. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Intergroup retaliation and intra-group praise gain: The effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution
AN  - 1504421878; 201405376
AB  - Intergroup vicarious retribution is the phenomenon whereby, after an out-group member attacks an in-group member, a member of the victim's group retaliates against a member of the perpetrator's group. This study examined the effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution through intra-group reputation based on praise gain and exclusion avoidance. In the experiment, we conducted a one-on-one match in which, after participants learned that an out-group member (as the winner) had imposed a fine on an in-group member (as the loser) in a previous round, winning participants were allowed to impose an arbitrary fine on the other losing out-group member. As a result, participants imposed a larger fine on their out-group member opponent in retaliation when they were expected by in-group members to cooperate than when such cooperation was not expected. Furthermore, participants regarded a fine as intra-group cooperation. Since a path analysis revealed a mediating effect of praise gain, but no mediating effect of exclusion avoidance, expected cooperation from in-group members facilitated vicarious retribution because those involved in retribution sought praise from other in-group members. These findings suggest that the intra-group reputation dynamics of expected cooperation and praise gain escalate intergroup conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A double standard when group members behave badly: Transgression credit to ingroup leaders
AN  - 1494750807; 201401854
AB  - This research tested the hypothesis that people forgive serious transgressions by ingroup leaders but not by other group members or outgroup leaders. They apply a double standard in judgments of ingroup leaders. A series of studies (N = 623), using an array of different ingroups and outgroups, tested how group members judged ingroup or outgroup leaders and nonleaders who unexpectedly transgressed or did not transgress in important intergroup scenarios. Experiments 1, 2, and 4 focused on captains and players in either soccer or netball sports competitions. Across studies, transgressive captains of ingroup teams were evaluated more favorably than captains from outgroup teams and (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) more favorably than transgressive ingroup players. Experiment 3 demonstrated the double standard in a minimal group paradigm. Experiment 5 showed that the double standard is only applied if the leader is perceived as serving the group's interest. Across studies, the double standard is evident in evaluations toward, inclusion and punishment of, and rewards to the transgressive targets. Implications for sport, politics, and business and intergroup conflict are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - MULTIPLE GROUP THREAT AND MALLEABLE WHITE ATTITUDES TOWARDS ACADEMIC MERIT
AN  - 1429640189; 201335832
AB  - As the White populace in the United States moves toward numerical minority status by 2042, how might Whites respond to impending threat of losing their dominant group position? In particular, how will Whites react at selective, elite universities, where Asians are increasingly prominent and other non-Whites are maintaining or capturing a larger share of enrollments? Drawing on group position theory, I test White commitment to meritocracy as a public policy, using a survey-based experiment (599 California adult residents) to examine the importance grade point average should have in public university admissions. Whites decrease the importance that grade point average should have when Asian group threat is primed. However, White Californians increase the importance that grade point average should have when thinking about group threat from either Blacks or Blacks and Asians simultaneously. Ethnoracial outgroup threat shifts White support for meritocracy in different directions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - In Varietate Harmonia? Intergroup Contact, Group Threat and Ethnic Tolerance in Scandinavian Regions
AN  - 1448995456; 201342855
AB  - The issue of immigration is becoming increasingly salient, and has emerged as a prominent political matter in the Scandinavian countries. Using multilevel modelling employing data from the statistical bureaus of Denmark, Norway and Sweden in combination with the latest round of the European Social Survey, the link between the percentage of immigrants in a region and individual's level of ethnic tolerance is examined. Most previous comparative studies of attitudes toward immigration have used European countries as level-2 units. We apply a new approach, investigating immigration at the regional level in these three fairly similar societies. Our findings show that regional diversity is associated with higher tolerance which is in accordance with intergroup contact theory. The relatively small size of immigrant populations together with the presence of post-materialistic values due to a relatively high standard of living makes the Scandinavian countries less receptive to mechanisms associated with group threat theory.

T1  - Social Identification Structures: The Effects of Perspective Taking
AN  - 1364700143; 201323599
AB  - Researchers who study perspective taking are generally optimistic about the potential for interventions to improve intergroup perceptions. The current research provides new insight into the conditions that frame the intergroup outcomes of perspective taking. The results show that the effects of perspective taking are not always positive but depend on perspective takers' degree of identification with the in-group. In two experiments, we demonstrated that adopting the perspective of an out-group member can have damaging effects on intergroup perceptions among group members who are highly identified with the in-group. Specifically, compared with less committed members, those who identified highly with the in-group used a greater number of negative traits to describe the out-group following perspective taking. Such perspective taking also led participants with high in-group identification to judge the out-group less favorably. Understanding how social identity concerns frame the outcome of perspective taking is crucial to its effective employment in intergroup-relations programs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Determinants of Ethnic Minority Confidence in the Police
AN  - 1347783669; 201318939
AB  - In this article I test the contribution which (aspects of) social capital theory, performance theory and the procedural justice-based model can make towards explaining ethnic minorities' confidence in the police. To answer my central question-What determining factors account for minorities' level of confidence in the police?-I conducted regression analysis of quantitative data collected from minority-group members in Belgium via 456 face-to-face interviews. The results suggest that feelings of insecurity and perceptions of discrimination play a large part in accounting for ethnic minorities' confidence (or lack of) in the police.

T1  - When East meets West: A longitudinal examination of the relationship between group relative deprivation and intergroup contact in reunified Germany
AN  - 1283641788; 201303168
AB  - Intergroup contact and group relative deprivation have both been shown to play a key role in the understanding of intergroup relations. Nevertheless, we know little about their causal relationship. In order to shed some light on the directionality and causality of the relationship between intergroup contact and group relative deprivation, we analysed responses by East and West Germans from k = 97 different cities, collected 6 (NT1 = 1,001), 8 (NT2 = 747), and 10 years (NT3 = 565) after reunification. Multi-level cross-lagged analyses showed that group relative deprivation at T1 led to more (rather than less) intergroup contact between East and West Germans 2 years as well as 4 years later. We found no evidence for the reverse causal relationship, or moderation by group membership. Furthermore, admiration mediated the positive effect of relative deprivation on intergroup contact for both East and West Germans. This intriguing finding suggests that intergroup contact may be used as a proactive identity management strategy by members of both minority and majority groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Family Life and Acculturation Attitudes: A Study among Four Immigrant Groups in the Netherlands
AN  - 1347781121; 201318765
AB  - This article examines the relationship between different aspects of family life and acculturation attitudes among adults of the four main immigrant groups in the Netherlands. The focus is on the importance of early parental practices and current (national and transnational) family relationships for the attitude, first, towards socio-cultural maintenance and, second, towards socio-cultural adaptation. The results show that family life matters for both attitudes, but more strongly for the endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance. Family contacts and support are positively related to the endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance but not to the attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation. Growing up with loving and supporting parents is associated with a more positive attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation. In addition to, and independent from, the individual's language proficiency, immigrants within families who speak Dutch more often have a more positive attitude towards socio-cultural adaptation and a lower endorsement of socio-cultural maintenance.

T1  - Latino Residential Isolation and the Risk of Obesity in Utah: The Role of Neighborhood Socioeconomic, Built-Environmental, and Subcultural Context
AN  - 900899073; 21274631
AB  - Issue Title: Special Focus: Chronic Illness and Disease              The prevalence rate of obesity in the United States has been persistently high in recent decades, and disparities in obesity risks are routinely observed. Both individual and contextual factors should be considered when addressing health disparities. This study examines how Latino-white spatial segregation is associated with the risk of obesity for Latinos and whites, whether neighborhood socioeconomic resources, the built environment, and subcultural orientation serve as the underlying mechanisms, and whether neighborhood context helps explain obesity disparities across ethnic and immigrant groups. The study was based on an extensive database containing self-reported BMI measures obtained from driver license records in Utah merged with census data and several GIS-based data. Multilevel analyses were performed to examine the research questions. For both men and women, Latino residential isolation is significantly and positively linked to the risk of obesity; after controlling for immigrant concentration, this effect gets amplified. Moreover, for men and women, the segregation effect is partly attributable to neighborhood SES and the built environment; and only for women is it partly attributable to obesity prevalence in the neighborhood. Place matters for individual risk of obesity for both men and women and there are multifarious pathways linking residence to obesity. Among the demographic, socioeconomic, physical, and cultural aspects of neighborhood context examined in this study, perhaps the most modifiable environment features that could prevent weight gain and its associated problems would be the built environmental factors such as greenness, park access, and mixed land use.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Contextual Predictors of Cumulative Biological Risk: Segregation and Allostatic Load
AN  - 1283644169; 201303252
AB  - Objectives: Segregation is considered to be a fundamental cause of race/ethnic disparities in health. However, very few studies have tested whether levels of segregation are related to health outcomes using multilevel data and appropriate methodologies. In this study, we investigate the relationships between two distinct dimensions of segregation and allostatic load to determine whether the experiences of individuals in segregated neighborhoods are related to allostatic load as a possible predisease indicator. Methods: To test our hypotheses, we utilized publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III, 1988-1994. We utilized random-intercept hierarchical generalized Poisson regression models to conduct our multivariate analyses. Results: We find that inflammatory response is related to both the evenness and exposure domains of segregation. That is, both the unequal distribution of minority groups over areal units as well as the degree of potential contact between minority and majority group members are related to these predisease pathways. Conclusions: In this study, we build on prior research by Massey (2004) to investigate the relationships between two distinct dimensions of segregation and allostatic load. Our results indicate that segregation is a significant predictor of allostatic load, net of individual-level characteristics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - In Consideration of Social Context: Re-examining the Linguistic Intergroup Bias Paradigm
AN  - 904383192
AB  - The role of language in the transmission of prejudice, including the features of the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) paradigm, has received much theoretical attention. This study investigates whether LIB predictions hold true within a relatively harmonious bilingual context. The LIB is examined as a function of several individual and sociocontextual factors, including second language confidence, group identification, and group vitality. Results support, but with qualification, the LIB phenomenon. While some participants demonstrated a LIB effect, others communicated out-group favoritism. Minority-group members used linguistic bias differently than majority-group members. Results are discussed within the context of social psychological theories of communication. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ingroup identification as a moderator of racial bias in a shoot-no shoot decision task
AN  - 907927886; 201124527
AB  - In this experiment, group identification is examined as a potential moderator of the documented racial bias in a shoot-no shoot paradigm. Target race (Black or White) was manipulated within-subjects, and (White) participants' strength of racial ingroup identification was employed as a continuous predictor. Using signal detection analyses, it was found that the criterion to shoot Black targets decreased as an increasing function of racial ingroup identification. This relationship held even after controlling for gender, social dominance orientation, a measure of cultural stereotyping, and the amount of contact with Blacks. Theoretical implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Negotiating social identities on an Eastern Maroon radio show
AN  - 1010633367; 201211360
AB  - In recent years, Pidgin and Creole languages have made significant inroads into the public domain of the countries where they are spoken. The media, and the radio broadcasting sector in particular, are the areas in which they figure most prominently. Extension of their use has brought about linguistic changes (Garrett, 2000). This paper explores such changes in relation to the Eastern Maroon radio program Loweman Pansu broadcasted in French Guiana. It investigates whether the program assimilates established norms and practices of programs run in European languages or introduces innovative ones based on local practices. Analysis suggests that the program's makeup and linguistic practices contribute to the emergence of an alternative social space that is distinctly Eastern Maroon in character but integrates properties that are linked to the urban context. This contributes to the construction of a modern urban Maroon identity that transcends traditional ethnic and national borders. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Ecstasy Use and Associated Risk Factors Among Asian-American Youth: Findings From a National Survey
AN  - 877475846
AB  - This study examined ecstasy use and associated risk and protective factors among Asian American youth. Data from 996 Asian American adolescents and 1,108 Asian American young adults were used. Ecstasy use was relatively common among Asian American youth. Among adolescents, it was associated with older age, poor parent-child communication, having been approached by drug sellers, living in a metropolitan area, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Among Asian American young adults, it was associated with having been born in the United States, having been approached by drug sellers, criminal justice system involvement, and positive attitudes toward substance use. Implications for designing substance use prevention/intervention programs for this minority group are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Priming Patriots: Social Identity Processes And The Dynamics Of Public Support For War
AN  - 875717398; 201115506
AB  - Contemporary theories of opinion dynamics-exemplified by Zaller's "receive-accept-sample" model-tend to assume that attitude change should occur only following exposure to new, attitude-relevant information. Within this prevailing view, the expected direction and magnitude of opinion change is largely a function of the tone and content of the new information to which one is exposed. In contrast, social identification theories show how opinion change can occur when a person's environmental context activates social knowledge stored in long-term memory. These theories propose that attitude change can result merely from increasing the perceived salience of a social conflict. They further propose that the direction and magnitude of opinion change should be unrelated to the tone or content of the information that draws attention to the conflict. This study examines how the ebb and flow of war news on the front page of the New York Times is related to changes in levels of domestic public support for major American military conflicts from 1950 to the present. We find no consistent or compelling evidence that levels of aggregate war support change in ways predicted by information updating models. To the contrary, a social identification process appears to be underlying the aggregate dynamics of war support. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Boundaries of ethnic identity in Central Asia: titular and Russian perceptions of ethnic commonalities in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan
AN  - 870433160; 201114264
AB  - Using data from nationally representative public opinion surveys done in 2005 in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the authors focus on the titular groups as well as the Russians in both countries and provide assessments of their perceived ethnic commonalities with one another and with various other ethnic groups, including Uzbeks and Jews in each country. The results indicate that there are hierarchies of intergroup differentiations that help to delineate the boundaries of ethnic identities in both countries. Multivariate analyses show the systematic effects of regional variables in shaping these ethnic boundaries. The basic topographies of the boundaries are consistent with the effects of social identification processes and the relative power and social standings of the different target ethnic groups across the regions. Our results lend clear support to the ethnic boundaries paradigm by underscoring that ethnic boundaries can be independent of objective commonalities and can vary according to contexts.

T1  - Racial Identity-Related Differential Attributions of Inadequate Responses to Hurricane Katrina: A Social Identity Perspective
AN  - 1081864416; 201235157
AB  - This study examines the attribution of responsibility for the problematic response to Hurricane Katrina in the fall of 2005. Based on social identity theory, the study compared the attribution with racism and non-racism factors (situational vs. dispositional attributions) between African American and European American students (n = 505). As hypothesized, African American identity was related to greater racism attribution, even after controlling for demographics, faith factors, and cognitive-emotional reactions to the hurricanes. European American identity was associated with more executive-responsibility attributions, but the effect vanished after adjusting other factors. The study underscores the importance of acknowledging group identity rather than an overarching American identity in exploring the race effect after a national collective trauma. The consequential implications for disaster planning, future research investigation, and social service delivery are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Public Attitudes towards Recent Foreign Policy Issues: Britain's Involvement in the Iraq and Afghanistan Conflicts
AN  - 902084724; 201122823
AB  - This article assesses which factors underpin public attitudes towards two recent and controversial foreign policy issues: Britain's involvement in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Using data from the 2005 and 2010 British Election Studies, it undertakes a statistical examination of which sociological and political factors are related to support for and opposition to British involvement in these conflicts. It shows that attitudes are structured both by social characteristics and by beliefs and evaluations rooted in domestic politics. The former include gender, age and ethnic group, while the latter include partisanship and newspaper readership. It demonstrates the need for further investigation of foreign policy attitudes among the British public. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Group-Based Trust With The Investment Game
AN  - 902083631; 201122191
AB  - Group-based trust was investigated by considering the relationship between 2 groups with differing socioeconomic status. High-status (Northern Italians) and low-status (Southern Italians) group members played a modified version of the investment game (Berg, Dickhaut, & McCabe, 1995), paired with an ingroup or an outgroup member. Results showed that for low-status group members, trust was higher in the outgroup than ingroup condition, while high-status group members did not prefer the ingroup over the outgroup. These findings highlight the importance of studying the effects of status in research on group-based trust. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Capital Across European Countries: Individual and Aggregate Determinants of Group Membership
AN  - 896167276; 201120124
AB  - Social capital refers to norms and networks of reciprocity, trust, and cooperation that facilitate coordinated action for a mutual benefit. Theoretical and empirical studies have documented the positive contribution of social capital in social welfare and development. This study empirically explores the determinants of social capital, in the form of group membership, across European countries. Data is derived from the European Community Household Panel, which covers a large sample of individuals from a set of European countries. Binary logistic regression models are applied to regress an index of individuals' group membership on a set of individual characteristics (income, education, gender, age, marital status, employment), as well as aggregate characteristics of countries (GDP per capita, income inequality, social trust, trust in public institutions, corruption, unemployment, and violation of political and civil rights). Results provide evidence of the impact of both individual and aggregate factors on group membership. These factors constitute a possible means to rebuilding patterns of social capital, especially in Southern European countries, where special-interest groups and patron-client relations prevail over generalized norms and networks of reciprocity, trust, and cooperation that promote wider social welfare and development objectives.

T1  - From reason-giving to collective action: Argument-based learning and European integration
AN  - 1010630986; 201210586
AB  - The aim of this article is to contribute to the further development of deliberative theory -- to make it more applicable to research on EU integration -- by establishing alternative and more concise micro-mechanisms to those of the rationalist bargaining perspectives. It is suggested that the micro-mechanism through which deliberation has an effect on outcomes is what is termed argument-based learning, which means that an actor accepts the validity of a presented argument so that (s)he acts upon it. Moreover, the article differentiates between three types of argument-based learning considered relevant in the EU context. On this basis, it suggests a two-step analytical approach for studies of EU decision-making processes. In trying out the empirical relevance of the framework, it is applied to a case where one would not expect agreements on common EU policies to have been reached due to argument-based learning, namely EU coordination towards the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC). The framework proved helpful in accounting for agreements that are puzzling from a rationalist perspective. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright NISA.]

T1  - Foundations of anti-immigrant sentiment: The variable nature of perceived group threat across changing European societies, 2002-2006
AN  - 1928656185
AB  - In this article we examine how Europeans perceive the consequences of immigration. We draw upon group threat, conflict and boundary-making theories to differentiate between probable reasons of anti-immigrant sentiment. We hypothesize that perceived threats vary over time and across countries since their nature may shift according to changing economic and other conditions. Using data from three rounds and 24 countries of the European Social Survey, perceived threat is explained by socio-economic characteristics, political orientation and structural conditions. We then focus on more specific threats in economic and cultural terms and how they vary in their effects on negative attitudes toward immigration. Our findings support variable economic and cultural foundations of anti-immigrant sentiment exerting different influence associated with changing economic conditions. Implications of these findings for future policy and research are discussed in the light of the current economic crisis.

T1  - RACIAL-ETHNIC INTOLERANCE AND SUPPORT FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: A CROSS-NATIONAL COMPARISON
AN  - 748837723
AB  - This article tests cross-nationally the minority group threat thesis that public sentiments toward repressive crime-control policies reflect conflicted racial and ethnic relations. Using multiple data sets representing France, Belgium, the Netherlands, East and West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Denmark, Great Britain, Greece, Spain, Finland, Sweden, Austria, Canada, Ireland, and Portugal, we examine whether racial and ethnic intolerance -- animus, resentments, or negative sentiments toward minorities -- predicts greater support for the death penalty. Our results reveal that the respondents were significantly more likely to express support for capital punishment if they were racially or ethnically intolerant while controlling for other covariates of public opinion. These findings indicate that the link between support for capital punishment and racial and ethnic animus may occur universally in countries with conflicted racial and ethnic relations.

T1  - Keeping the vermin out: Perceived disease threat and ideological orientations as predictors of exclusionary immigration attitudes
AN  - 743065620; 201043066
AB  - Integrating evolutionary and social representations theories, the current study examines the relationship between perceived disease threat and exclusionary immigration attitudes in the context of a potential avian influenza pandemic. This large-scale disease provides a realistic context for investigating the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes. The main aim of this cross-sectional study (N = 412) was to explore mechanisms through which perceived chronic and contextual disease threats operate on immigration attitudes. Structural equation models show that the relationship between chronic disease threat (germ aversion) and exclusionary immigration attitudes (assimilationist immigration criteria, health-based immigration criteria and desire to reduce the proportion of foreigners) was mediated by ideological and normative beliefs (social dominance orientation, belief in a dangerous world), but not by contextual disease threat (appraisal of avian influenza pandemic threat). Contextual disease threat only predicted support for health-based immigration criteria. The conditions under which real-life disease threats influence intergroup attitudes are scrutinized. Convergence and dissimilarity of evolutionary and social representational approaches in accounting for the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes are discussed.

T1  - Democracy and denomination: democratic values among Muslim minorities and the majority population in Denmark
AN  - 743049948; 201033631
AB  - Based on a survey of ethnic minorities (immigrants as well as descendants) and the ethnic majority, this article analyses the distribution and explanation of democratic values in Denmark. Democratic values are measured according to three criteria: democratic principles, democratic rights and family democracy. With respect to democratic rights, the analysis shows that Muslim immigrants and descendants score slightly lower on democratic principles and family democracy; however, they have more democratic values than the majority of the populations in Western Europe. Democratic values do not differ between immigrants and descendants of the same ethnic group, and differences in values do not depend on immigrants' length of stay in the host society. Finally, among ethnic minorities of mixed religious composition, the differences between the Muslim parts of these groups are larger than the differences between ethnic groups. Thus, differences in democratic values are explained by ethnicity, not religion. Adapted from the source document.
