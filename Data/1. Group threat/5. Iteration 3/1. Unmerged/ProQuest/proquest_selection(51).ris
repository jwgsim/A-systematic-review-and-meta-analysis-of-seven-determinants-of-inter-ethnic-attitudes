T1  - Political Trust in East and Southeast Asia: The Joint Effects of Education, Corruption Perception, and Urbanization
AN  - 2617957978
AB  - This article examines how education, corruption perception, and urbanization jointly influence political trust in Asia. Previous literature proposes a “performance-based evaluation” thesis whereby corruption perception is associated with political trust. We hypothesized this association could be moderated by individual educational attainment and socioeconomic statuses. Applying multilevel models to the Asian Barometer Survey (2001–2016) data, we found interaction effects of education, the urban–rural divide, and corruption perceptions in shaping political trust in 14 East and Southeast Asia societies. For rural Asians, education does not affect political trust when they perceive low corruption; it leads to lower trust when they perceive high corruption. For urban Asians, such an interaction does not exist, and education monotonically erodes political trust no matter how they perceive the severity of corruption.

T1  - CAN WE HAVE TRUST IN HOST GOVERNMENT? SELF-ESTEEM, WORK ATTITUDES AND PREJUDICE OF LOW-STATUS EXPATRIATES LIVING IN CHINA
AN  - 2581018966
AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates' perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes; it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates' work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates.

T1  - Economic development, attitudes towards migration and the (lack of) willingness to help refugees: insights from the Aurora Humanitarian Index
AN  - 2595777504
AB  - In this paper Jacobs examines the connection between attitudes on migration, perceived threats linked to migration and the (lack of) willingness to help refugees using a data set of twelve countries from a survey project called the Aurora Humanitarian Index. The higher the perceived ethnic threat (economic, cultural or religious), the less willing individuals are to mobilize for refugees. In addition to patterns on the individual level, we examine the impact of country characteristics (gross domestic product (GDP), number of migrants and so on) through correlational and multilevel analysis. While neither the proportion of migrants nor the proportion of refugees impacts on the willingness to mobilize in favour of refugees, the economic situation does have an effect. In richer countries there is less willingness to help. Furthermore, we can observe that the effect of both opposition to migration and the perception of refugees as posing an economic threat is exacerbated in richer countries (countries with a higher GDP).

T1  - Dehumanization of African-Americans Influences Racial Shooter Biases
AN  - 2287812314
AB  - Dehumanization, defined as the psychological process through which others are perceived as being non-human, has been of interest to researchers for many years, in part because of its potential to inform our understanding of how human beings justify harm toward out-groups. The current research extends the literature by using a novel experimental manipulation to investigate dehumanization’s effect on automatic behavior toward out-groups (e.g., racial shooter biases) and examined perceived threat as a moderator. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (African-American dehumanization, white dehumanization, and control). Across two studies (Study 1, n = 290; Study 2, n = 318), those in the African-American dehumanization condition were quicker to correctly shoot armed African-American (vs. white) targets (d = − .21, 95% CI [− .38, − .04]) compared to the other two conditions. This effect was only significant among participants who perceived African-Americans as relatively more threatening.

T1  - Media portrayal of terrorism and Muslims: a content analysis of Turkey and France
AN  - 2220517830
AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue.

T1  - White out of mind: Identity suppression as a coping strategy among Whites anticipating racially charged interactions: GPIR
AN  - 2087352558
AB  - Discussing racial issues often makes Whites anxious, particularly when their conversation partners are Black. We theorized that Whites seek to avoid anxiety by suppressing thoughts of White identity prior to such interactions. In Study 1, White participants expected to discuss a race-related or nonracial topic with a Black or White partner. An Implicit Association Test (IAT) measured subsequent changes in the activation of participants’ White identities (i.e., self–White associations). The prospect of discussing race-related (vs. nonracial) topics with a Black partner reduced participants’ self–White associations, implying identity suppression. Moreover, participants’ nonverbal responses suggest that identity suppression functioned to mute participants’ anxiety. In Study 2, participants completed the identity activation measure only after learning that they would not interact with a partner. Consistent with “rebound” effects known to follow suppression, participants who previously expected to discuss a race-related topic with a Black partner showed heightened self–White associations.

T1  - Multiculturalism and Attitudes Toward Immigrants: The Impact of Perceived Cultural Distance
AN  - 2058338219
AB  - Multiculturalism can be construed in different ways with different effects on majority members’ attitudes toward immigrant-origin groups. Thinking about why the broad goals of multiculturalism are important for society might reduce feelings of outgroup threat and less prejudicial attitudes. In contrast, thinking about how exactly these goals can be accomplished might evoke feelings of threat that lead to prejudice. The aim of this experimental research conducted in France and the Netherlands was to examine the effect of these two construals of multiculturalism of attitudes toward immigrants and whether these effects depend on perceived cultural distance. The findings show that a focus on why multiculturalism is important for society is more beneficial for attitudes toward immigrant-origin groups for people perceiving relatively high cultural distance. In contrast, a focus on how the goals of multiculturalism can be accomplished has a more detrimental effect on attitudes for people perceiving relatively low cultural distance.

T1  - Understanding Evaluations of Foreigners in Modern South Africa: The Relationship Between Subjective Wellbeing and Xenophobia
AN  - 2021759275
AB  - Recent and recurrent violence against immigrants in South Africa highlight the prevalence of xenophobia in the country. Is there a relationship between attitudes towards immigrant sentiment and life satisfaction at the individual level in that nation? Life satisfaction could be a proxy for anxiety, social alienation or insecurity which may be driving xenophobic sentiment. Using data from the 2013 South African Social Attitudes Survey, this paper examines the relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and life satisfaction (measured using the Personal Wellbeing Index). The study focuses exclusively on the attitudes of the country’s Black African majority. Bivariate and multivariate analysis found that life satisfaction did not have a strong relationship with pro-immigrant sentiments. Objective measures of socio-economic status (such as educational attainment) did not have a significant relationship with attitudes towards immigrants. Although improving subjective wellbeing among Black Africans is a worthwhile policy goal in of itself, the findings of this study suggest that addressing xenophobia among this group will require focus on other areas. Intergroup contact, interracial attitudes and perceptions about the consequences of immigration were found to be stronger predictors of pro-immigrant sentiment than life satisfaction. There was some evidence of `outsider solidarity ‘in the study—isiTsonga speakers and members of the ethnolinguistic Black African minority were more pro-immigrant in sentiment than other groups. The implications of this finding on the study of pro-immigration attitudes are discussed in the conclusion.

T1  - Ancestral and instrumental in the politics of ethnic and religious conflict
AN  - 1934041470
AB  - Ethnicity, like race, religion, and nationality, is a feature of group identity that is contested. There are literatures devoted to each, and in each there are those who see the origins of identity and affiliation in ancestry and deeply rooted affect and those who see these as socially constructed and instrumentally used by elites. Yet all recognize that the ancestral is socially constructed and that social constructions make use of existing cultural features, and that the vertical cleavages of race, religion, ethnicity, and nationality dominate the horizontal ones of class. This generates implications for institutional changes, for the pursuit of extraterritorial interests, for the selection of explanatory narratives for conflict when multiple attributions are possible, for intra-communal conflict, and for policies for ethnic conflict regulation.

T1  - Explaining Kazakhstani identity: supraethnic identity, ethnicity, language, and citizenship
AN  - 1925475124
AB  - The demographic composition of Kazakhstan after the fall of the Soviet Union presented a dilemma to the new Kazakhstani government: Should it advance a Kazakh identity as paramount, possibly alienating the large non-Kazakh population? Or should it advocate for a non-ethnicized national identity? How would those decisions be made in light of global norms of liberal multiculturalism? And, critically, would citizens respond to new frames of identity? This paper provides an empirical look at supraethnic identity-building in Kazakhstan - that is, at the development of a national identity that individuals place above or alongside their ethnic identification. We closely examine the Assembly of People of Kazakhstan to describe how Kazakhstani policies intersect with theories of nationalism and nation-building. We then use ordered probit models to analyze data from a 2014 survey to examine how citizens of Kazakhstan associate with a "Kazakhstani" supraethnic identity. Our findings suggest that despite the Assembly of People's rhetoric, there are still significant barriers to citizen-level adoption of a supraethnic identity in Kazakhstan, particularly regarding language. However, many individuals do claim an association with Kazakhstani identity, especially those individuals who strongly value citizenship in the abstract.

T1  - Abortion attitudes among South Africans: findings from the 2013 social attitudes survey
AN  - 1914571297
AB  - Abortion is legal in South Africa, but over half of abortions remain unsafe there. Evidence suggests women who are (Black) African, of lower socioeconomic status, living with HIV, or residents of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, or Limpopo provinces are disproportionately vulnerable to morbidity or mortality from unsafe abortion. Negative attitudes toward abortion have been documented in purposively sampled studies, yet it remains unclear what attitudes exist nationally or whether they differ across sociodemographic groups, with implications for inequities in service accessibility and health. In the current study, we analysed nationally representative data from 2013 to estimate the prevalence of negative abortion attitudes in South Africa and to identify racial, socioeconomic and geographic differences. More respondents felt abortion was 'always wrong' in the case of family poverty (75.4%) as compared to foetal anomaly (55%), and over half of respondents felt abortion was 'always wrong' in both cases (52.5%). Using binary logistic regression models, we found significantly higher odds of negative abortion attitudes among non-Xhosa African and Coloured respondents (compared to Xhosa respondents), those with primary education or less, and residents of Gauteng and Limpopo (compared to Western Cape). We contextualise and discuss these findings using a human rights-based approach to health.

T1  - Becoming Overweight without Gaining a Pound: Weight Evaluations and the Social Integration of Mexicans in the United States: IMR
AN  - 1876790365
AB  - Mexican women gain weight with increasing duration in the United States. In the United States, body dissatisfaction tends to be associated with depression, disordered eating, and incongruent weight evaluations, particularly among white women and women of higher socioeconomic status. However, it remains unclear how being overweight and obesity are interpreted by Mexican women. Using comparable data of women aged 20-64 from both Mexico (the 2006 Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutricion; N = 17,012) and the United States (the 1999-2009 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys; N = 8,487), we compare weight status evaluations among Mexican nationals, Mexican immigrants, US-born Mexicans, US-born non-Hispanic whites, and US-born non-Hispanic blacks. Logistic regression analyses, which control for demographic and socioeconomic variables and measured body mass index and adjust for the likelihood of migration for Mexican nationals, indicate that the tendency to self-evaluate as overweight among Mexicans converges with levels among non-Hispanic whites and diverges from blacks over time in the United States. Overall, the results suggest a US integration process in which Mexican-American women's less critical self-evaluations originate in Mexico but fade with time in the United States as they gradually adopt US white norms for thinner body sizes. These results are discussed in light of prior research about social comparison and negative health assimilation.

T1  - Dominant Language-Ethnicity Notions of the Malaysian Chinese in Sarawak: Paternity or Patrimony?
AN  - 1864678077
AB  - This study examines the relationship between language and ethnicity in the identities of Malaysian Chinese, using Fishman's (1977) dimensions of paternity, patrimony and phenomenology. The data for the study were taken from language attitude questionnaires completed by 300 Chinese (150 Foochow, 150 Hokkien) and interviews with 18 participants (nine Foochow, nine Hokkien) living in Kuching, the capital city of the Malaysian state of Sarawak. The questionnaire results suggest that Chinese from the Foochow and Hokkien participant groups believe in both the paternity and patrimony dimensions of ethnicity, but the interview results also revealed a tendency towards viewing ethnicity as an inherited characteristic. Some are of the view that those who are of Foochow/Hokkien descent but cannot speak the ethnic language are "half Foochow/Hokkien". The interview results also suggest that comparatively more Hokkien participants than Foochow participants may be inclined towards the patrimonial view of ethnicity. This finding is further supported by questionnaire results showing more frequent use of the ethnic language (Foochow/Hokkien) by the Hokkien than by the Foochow. Both sources of data provide evidence that Foochow and Hokkien in Malaysia use Mandarin for daily communication to a greater extent than their ethnic language. The findings indicate that ethnic language use is linked to conceptualisation of ethnicity.

T1  - Bonding or bridging? Professional network organizations of second-generation Turks in the Netherlands and France
AN  - 1850372838
AB  - This article analyses network organizations founded by descendants of Turkish migrants in the Netherlands and France. By surveying members of two such organizations and interviewing several of their board members, we learn how these organizations function, their success in building and extending social networks, and their efficacy at improving labour market prospects for young second-generation professionals of Turkish descent. Our findings reveal a hybrid structure, whereby the organizations gear many of their activities towards mainstream society. In comparison to traditional immigrant organizations, their attitude is more open to other social groups, yet they still have a clear stronghold in the ethnic immigrant community. We conclude that ethnicity is not the main element in the successful second generation's organizing process. Factors such as educational trajectories, professional ambitions, feelings of responsibility for other members and newly acquired socioeconomic status are the main reasons for this group to organize.

T1  - An Interdisciplinary Approach to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Clinical Competence, Professional Training, and Ethical Care: Introduction to the Special Issue
AN  - 1914571160
AB  - There are exigent reasons to foster lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) competence, training, and ethical care for health professionals within an interdisciplinary paradigm. LGBT individuals experience serious health and psychosocial disparities; moreover, these inequalities can be amplified when other aspects of diversity such as race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic status intersect with sexual orientation and gender identity (Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2011). While the origins of LGBT health and psychosocial disparities are manifold, deficiencies in professional training, ethical care, and clinical competence are underlying contributors (IOM, 2011). In addition, LGBT clinical competency advancements are often siloed within the various health care disciplines-thus advances by one group of health professionals often have limited impact for those practicing in different health and human service fields. This special issue explores LGBT clinical competence, professional training, and ethical care within an interdisciplinary context and, to our knowledge, represents the first attempt to address LGBT clinical competence from a multidisciplinary health care perspective.

T1  - Migration Background and Educational Achievements in Russia
TT  - Origen inmigrante y logros educativos en Rusia
AN  - 1886285509
AB  - This article empirically examines the impact of migration background on educational achievements in Russia. The main method consisted of logit regressions with longitudinal data for schoolchildren aged 6-14 (from 1st to 8th grades) over the 2010-2013 period (four waves). In contrast to most of the previous empirical literature, the panel data controlled the impact of time-invariant determinants of educational achievements. The findings suggest that migration background has no effect on educational achievements after controlling for socioeconomic status (ses), child's health, school type, settlement and other individual characteristics, all of which have statistically significant effects in distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful students. Thus, there is no educational gap between migrant and native students, something that differentiates Russia from the majority of developed countries.

T1  - THE RACIAL ECOLOGY OF LEAD POISONING
AN  - 1832347295
AB  - This paper examines the racial ecology of lead exposure as a form of environmental inequity, one with both historical and contemporary significance. Drawing on comprehensive data from over one million blood tests administered to Chicago children from 1995-2013 and matched to over 2300 geographic block groups, we address two major questions: (1) What is the nature of the relationship between neighborhood-level racial composition and variability in children's elevated lead prevalence levels? And (2) what is the nature of the relationship between neighborhood-level racial composition and rates of change in children's prevalence levels over time within neighborhoods? We further assess an array of structural explanations for observed racial disparities, including socioeconomic status, type and age of housing, proximity to freeways and smelting plants, and systematic observations of housing decay and neighborhood disorder. Overall, our theoretical framework posits lead toxicity as a major environmental pathway through which racial segregation has contributed to the legacy of Black disadvantage in the United States. Our findings support this hypothesis and show alarming racial disparities in toxic exposure, even after accounting for possible structural explanations. At the same time, however, our longitudinal results show the power of public health policies to reduce racial inequities.

T1  - Ethnicity and immunization coverage among schools in Israel
AN  - 1800231529
AB  - Objective. Recent years have seen a global trend of declining immunization rates of recommended vaccines that is more pronounced among school-age children. Ethnic disparities in child immunization rates have been reported in several countries. We investigated an effect of ethnicity on the vaccination rates of immunizations routinely administered within schools in Israel.
Design. Data were collected from the Ministry of Health database regarding immunization coverage for all registered Israeli schools (3736) in the years 2009-2011. Negative binomial regression was used to assess the association between school ethnicity and immunization coverage while controlling for school characteristics.
Results. The lowest immunization coverage was found in Bedouin schools (median values of 75.1%, 81.5% and 0% for the first, second and eighth grades, respectively) in 2011. During this year, vaccination coverage in the first and second grades in Jewish schools was 1.51 and 1.35 times higher, respectively, compared to Bedouin schools. In the years 2009 and 2010, no significant increase in risk for lower vaccination rate was observed in Bedouin schools, and children in Arab and Druze schools were more likely to have been vaccinated.
Conclusion. The lower vaccination refusal rate found in Bedouin schools supports the hypothesis that difficulties related to accessibility constitute the main problem rather than noncompliance with the recommended vaccination protocol for school-age children, featuring higher socio-economic status groups. Our study emphasizes the importance of identifying, beyond the national-level data, subpopulation groups at risk for non-vaccination. This knowledge is essential to administrative-level policy-makers for the allocation of resources and the planning of intervention programs.

T1  - Life course SES and cardiovascular risk: Heterogeneity across race/ethnicity and gender
AN  - 1768899218
AB  - We examine four life course models as they relate to adolescent SES, adult SES, and cardiovascular risk -- the sensitive period, pathways, accumulation, and social mobility models. Accounting for race/ethnic and gender differences in life course processes, we analyzed Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a nationally representative sample of individuals enrolled in grades 7-12 when they were first interviewed in 1994/5. We restricted our sample to whites, blacks, and Latinos who were interviewed in Waves I and IV and provided biomarker data (n = 11,397). The cardiovascular risk score at Wave IV combined waist circumference, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and C-reactive protein. We found evidence for each of the four life course models for white women, whereas the sensitive period was indicated for white men. Upward mobility was also associated with higher CVD risk among white men as compared to those who were socio-economically advantaged at both time points. The pathway model was significant for Latino women. No life course models were significant for black men or women or Latino men. Our findings demonstrate the importance of applying an intersectional lens to understanding CVD risk over the life course.

T1  - "Sorry You Had to Go Through That": A Taxonomy of Individual Responses to Stories of Race-Based Social Suffering
AN  - 1752001376
AB  - Social suffering is distress engendered by cultural, social, and political forces. Responses to stories of such suffering serve as rejoinders in an identity negotiation process and can foster either healing or compounded distress -- for both individuals and communities alike. Because there is no published study (to our knowledge) that focuses on the language individuals use in responding to stories of social suffering, the present study aimed to develop a theoretically grounded and empirically derived taxonomy of these responses. In order to develop and validate such a taxonomy, we collected a total of 172 audio-recorded responses to two true stories of race-based social suffering from two samples of undergraduate students at a large university in the greater Los Angeles area. The resulting coding scheme is presented here along with evidence of its reliability and validity. [web URL: http://jls.sagepub.com/content/35/1/3.abstract]

T1  - The (racial) biases of communication: rethinking media and blackness
AN  - 1784151579
AB  - The media studies approach to race often examines blackness through depictions in music lyrics, movies, and videos. The vast majority of these studies posit that media may provide 'fair' or 'unfair' depictions of blackness. Less examined is the importance of media environments to the structuring of racial relations in the United States. This article extends the contemporary literature on black media studies by taking a 'medium theory' approach to analyzing blackness. I argue medium theory aids studies of blackness by showing the ways in which the technologies we use transform the environments we inhabit in ways that further racialization processes beyond depictions of music lyrics or reality TV. To examine the interrelations between media environments and blackness, I offer a critical rereading of the Underground Railroad. I argue the Underground Railroad's success was related to the necessity of brilliant planning and a complex understanding by slaves and conductors of the essential overlapping of space- and time-biased media cultures. In short, the different understandings of media ensured that the slaves and slave catchers inhabited radically different yet interconnected worlds or galaxies, increasing the effectiveness of the Underground Railroad for runaway slaves.

T1  - Discrimination, Racial Identity, and Cytokine Levels Among African-American Adolescents
AN  - 1728660658; 201534049
AB  - Purpose: Low-grade inflammation, measured by circulating levels of cytokines, is a pathogenic mechanism for several chronic diseases of aging. Identifying factors related to inflammation among African-American youths may yield insights into mechanisms underlying racial disparities in health. The purpose of the study was to determine whether (1) reported racial discrimination from ages 17-19 years forecasts heightened cytokine levels at the age of 22 years and (2) this association is lower for youths with positive racial identities. Methods: A longitudinal research design was used with a community sample of 160 African-Americans who were aged 17 years at the beginning of the study. Discrimination and racial identity were measured with questionnaires, and blood was drawn to measure basal cytokine levels. Ordinary least squares regression analyses were used to examine the hypotheses. Results: After controlling for socioeconomic risk, life stress, depressive symptoms, and body mass index, racial discrimination (Beta = .307; p < .01), racial identity (Beta = -.179; p < .05), and their interaction (Beta = -.180; p < .05) forecast cytokine levels. Youths exposed to high levels of racial discrimination evinced elevated cytokine levels 3 years later. This association was not significant for young adults with positive racial identities. Conclusions: High levels of interpersonal racial discrimination and the development of a positive racial identity operate jointly to determine low-grade inflammation levels that have been found to forecast chronic diseases of aging, such as coronary disease and stroke.

T1  - Patrolling Chineseness: Singapore's Kowloon Club and the ethnic adaptation of Hong Kongese to Singaporean society
AN  - 1680154654; 201514016
AB  - In combination with their strategy to recruit foreign talent, Singaporean state authorities have increasingly focused their attention on community integration schemes for Chinese professional newcomers. The government facilitated such integration with the creation of the Kowloon Club in 1990. The Kowloon Club is not only a government experiment that has been repeated three times since then, but also the only new migrant association that does not explicitly target Mainlanders. Through in-depth interviews with the Club's leadership, I explore the ethnic adaptation of the Kowloon Club membership as it negotiates the evolving sense of Chineseness found in state designs and Singaporean society. Much like the emergence of the 1997 Hong Kongese identity, the Kowloon Club's activities have shifted in strong reaction to the racialized category put forth by state authorities and embodied by Mainlander professionals in that the Club's activities now symbolize and help patrol what Chineseness means as everyday performance in the city-state. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Effects of Lifestyle Migration of Jews from Western Countries on Jerusalem/Ucinki zivljenjsko-stilskih migracij Judov iz Zahodnih drzav na Jeruzalem
AN  - 1830662263
AB  - Lifestyle migration has mainly been studied in the context of rural or coastal tourist destinations, less in cities. This case-study deals with the immigration of Jews from Western countries to Jerusalem, Israel's capital city. These immigrants generally enjoy a high socio-economic status, and are motivated by ideological and religious reasons. Moreover, these immigrants are highly desired by the State in their 'homecoming'. The article focuses on Baka, a neighbourhood in Jerusalem, where large communities of English- and French-speaking immigrants reside. This case-study contributes to the understanding of the effects lifestyle migration has on places, particularly gentrification, and expands our understanding of who lifestyle migrants are, what motivates them and how they live in their adopted countries.

T1  - Who They Were There: Immigrants Educational Selectivity and Their Childrens Educational Attainment
AN  - 1728660417; 201535216
AB  - This article examines the educational selectivity of immigrants in France -- i.e. how their level of education contrasts with that of non-migrants in their country of birth -- and the influence of this selectivity on the educational attainment of their children. I combine the Barro-Lee data set (2010) with the French TeO survey (2008-2009) to construct a measure of 'relative educational attainment', i.e. an immigrant's position in the distribution of educational attainment among the population of the same cohort and gender in the immigrant's country of birth. I demonstrate that the level of immigrants' relative educational attainment differs both between and within countries of origin. I then show the positive influence of immigrant parents' relative educational attainment on their children's educational attainment, over and above family socioeconomic status in France. The intergenerational transmission of cultural resources and subjective social status are the proposed sociological mechanisms that can account for the intergenerational effect of immigrant educational selectivity.

T1  - Using a Two-Step Method to Measure Transgender Identity in Latin America/the Caribbean, Portugal, and Spain
AN  - 1680152790; 201514050
AB  - Few comparative data are available internationally to examine health differences by transgender identity. A barrier to monitoring the health and well-being of transgender people is the lack of inclusion of measures to assess natal sex/gender identity status in surveys. Data were from a cross-sectional anonymous online survey of members (n > 36,000) of a sexual networking website targeting men who have sex with men in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries/territories in Latin America/the Caribbean, Portugal, and Spain. Natal sex/gender identity status was assessed using a two-step method (Step 1: assigned birth sex, Step 2: current gender identity). Male-to-female (MTF) and female-to-male (FTM) participants were compared to non-transgender males in age-adjusted regression models on socioeconomic status (SES) (education, income, sex work), masculine gender conformity, psychological health and well-being (lifetime suicidality, past-week depressive distress, positive self-worth, general self-rated health, gender related stressors), and sexual health (HIV-infection, past-year STIs, past-3 month unprotected anal or vaginal sex). The two-step method identified 190 transgender participants (0.54%; 158 MTF, 32 FTM). Of the 12 health-related variables, six showed significant differences between the three groups: SES, masculine gender conformity, lifetime suicidality, depressive distress, positive self-worth, and past-year genital herpes. A two-step approach is recommended for health surveillance efforts to assess natal sex/gender identity status. Cognitive testing to formally validate assigned birth sex and current gender identity survey items in Spanish and Portuguese is encouraged. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Spanish not spoken here: Accounting for the racialization of the Spanish language in the experiences of Mexican migrants in the United States
AN  - 1700674093; 201525185
AB  - For Spanish-speaking Latinos in the United States, the Spanish language is a component of identity that is often viewed as fundamental to their human experience. This deep connection between language and identity becomes problematic as a result of what we suggest in this paper is a deeply racialized attack on the use of the Spanish language. Drawing upon ethnographic and qualitative in-depth interview research with first-generation Mexican migrants in the US, we bring together the literatures on race and ethnicity to facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the ethnic and racialized processes involved in reaction to and treatment of the use of Spanish in the US. Centering the voices and experiences of first-generation migrants, we are able to explicate their experiences with respect to intersecting mechanisms of ethnocentrism, language oppression, and racism.

T1  - Anxiety, Depression, and Smoking Status Among Adults of Mexican Heritage on the Texas-Mexico Border
AN  - 1700676480; 201525348
AB  - The goal of the current analysis is to examine relationships between smoking status and anxiety and depression among adults of Mexican heritage to inform the development of culturally relevant smoking cessations efforts. Mexican heritage residents (N = 1,791) of the city of Brownsville, Texas, aged 18 years or older, enrolled in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort, were selected through two stage cluster sampling of randomly selected census tracts from the first and third quartiles of socio-economic status (SES) using Census 2000. Among current smokers, anxiety and depression scores were highest among women who had not completed high school (p< .05). Women who were former smokers, but not men, with at least a high school education and former smoking women born in the United States reported higher levels of anxiety and depression than never smoking women. Negative affective states may represent a greater barrier to smoking cessation among women than men. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Latino Spatial and Structural Assimilation: Close Intergroup Friendships among Houston-Area Latinos
AN  - 1551000286; 201428907
AB  - This article examines the cross-sectional association between spatial and structural assimilation among Latino adults in Harris County, Texas, USA. Prior studies have produced little evidence of any significant association between the racial/ethnic composition of Latinos' neighbourhoods and their social networks, particularly net of controls for socio-economic status (SES). But prior studies have failed to distinguish social ties that are either weak or exceptional from strong, systematic ties that may be more indicative of social integration, ignored the racial/ethnic diversity in Latinos' neighbourhoods and networks, or both. Negative binomial and multinomial logit analyses predicting close intergroup friendships among Latinos were conducted using data from the 2006 Houston Area Survey. Net of acculturation and SES, Latinos who lived in neighbourhoods that provided greater exposure to non-Hispanic whites were more likely to have non-Hispanic whites among their three closest friends than those who lived in Latino enclaves. Neighbourhood diversity, particularly among non-white residents, was also associated with diverse friendship networks among Latinos. Implications for the relationship between Latino spatial and structural assimilation are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bringing class back in: class consciousness and solidarity among Chinese migrant workers in Italy and the UK
AN  - 1660024540; 201505837
AB  - The growing literature on international migration has a tendency to emphasize homogenous elements such as shared ethnic background, social network and cultural similarities in shaping immigrants' identity. We argue that this underestimates the differences (and sometimes conflicts) of interests between ethnic employers and migrant workers and that class needs to be brought back into the studies of ethnic relationship. Based upon findings from a series of fieldwork in Veneto, Italy and East Midlands, UK, this article contends that class consciousness has co-existed, sometimes uneasily, alongside co-ethnic and cultural relationships among Chinese migrant workers and has played an important part in the making of new Chinese communities. By analysing the perspectives of Chinese migrant workers and their relationship with co-ethnic entrepreneurs, this article illustrates complex factors behind the formation, diffusion and development of class consciousness among Chinese migrant workers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN THE MARRIAGE-HEALTH RELATIONSHIP
AN  - 1751968661
AB  - In this paper, I use the fundamental cause perspective and intersectionality theory to conceptualize the relationship between marriage and health (Collins, 1990 ; Link & Phelan, 1995). Using the 2003 National Health Interview Survey, I find that among White Americans, the married are less depressed than the non-married, but this association diminishes as household income increases. Among Black men and affluent Black women, the married are more depressed than the non-married. Marriage is associated with better physical health among low income White Americans, but not among Black Americans. The results call into question the generalizability of the marriage-health relationship and underscore how the intersecting systems of socio-economic status, gender, and race influence the relationship between social experience and health.

T1  - Measuring the Meaning of Black Media Stereotypes and Their Relationship to the Racial Identity, Black History Knowledge, and Racial Socialization of African American Youth
AN  - 1700676525; 201525141
AB  - While consensus has grown about the prevalence of negative Black media images, measuring the influence of these images and youth rejection or endorsement of these images on Black youth well-being and identity is a new and understudied phenomenon. This study was designed to create a measure of Black media stereotypes for use with adolescents. Focus groups with Black youth ages 14 to 21 were conducted and the data were used to design the Black Media Messages Questionnaire (BMMQ). One hundred thirteen Black youth completed the BMMQ along with measures of racial socialization, racial identity, Black history knowledge, body image, and self-esteem. Confirmatory factor analysis of the BMMQ resulted in three scales with six factors. The factors were entered into correlation and ANOVA analyses. Age, gender, and TV viewing consistently correlated with BMMQ factors. ANOVA results demonstrated that few variables were significant for the positive stereotype BMMQ factors, but endorsement of negative Black stereotype media messages resulted in significant age and gender differences. Analyses also revealed expected relationships among BMMQ, racial socialization, racial identity, and Black history knowledge variables.

T1  - Conceptual and Methodological Challenges for Health Disparities Research and Their Policy Implications
AN  - 1559005057; 201432022
AB  - This special issue of the Journal of Social Issues contributes to a growing body of research that illuminates the mechanisms through which racism and discrimination influence the health status of people of color. Importantly, this special issue attempts to connect research examining how racism operates at the interpersonal, internalized, institutional, and structural levels, and points to a number of policy strategies to mitigate the racism-health relationship. Going forward, a comprehensive model of the lived experience of race is needed that considers the cumulative, interactive effects of the different forms of racism and related risk factors on health as they operate over the lifespan. Such a model must facilitate an intersectional analysis to better understand the interaction of race with gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, geography, and other factors, and should also consider the negative consequences of racism for Whites (e.g., poorer health of a growing share of their neighbors, coworkers, customers, and congregants).

T1  - The Narrative Construction of Identity in Contemporary Rwanda: A Study of An Ordinary Man by Paul Rusesabagina (with Tom Zoellner)
AN  - 1660023959; 201505526
AB  - In this article, I examine the autobiography of Paul Rusesabagina, An Ordinary Man, to interrogate the narrative construction of identity in contemporary Rwanda. My primary focus is the discursive and narrative dynamics involved in the problematical configuration of ethnic, class, and national identities prior to, and after the country's 1994 genocide. Regarding the contradictions in the way Rusesabagina attempts to articulate modern Rwandan identity (especially with respect to the perceived sameness and/or difference between Hutu and Tutsi), I argue that the dominant narratives of pre-colonial harmony he echoes are over-simplistic, homogenising and misleading in certain respects. This article thus seeks to problematise the prevailing idea - forcefully reinforced by Rusesabagina - that colonial interventions constitute the all-encompassing roots, rather than catalysers, of the endemic and seemingly irreconcilable differences that culminated in the genocide. My purpose in this regard is not to downplay colonialism's negative impact on social relations in Rwanda, but to foreground some of the often overlooked historical complexities that are revealed by Rusesabagina's valuable but as yet underexplored narrative.

T1  - A Fair Deal for Immigrants? The Truman Administration and Immigration Policy Reform
AN  - 1551000594; 201429053
AB  - This article offers a critique of President Harry Truman's contribution to twentieth-century immigration reform. It challenges the view that he presided over an era of groundbreaking and progressive changes in immigration policy, arguing instead that the liberal positions taken on key immigration and naturalisation matters by the Truman administration were mostly inherited from his predecessor, Franklin Roosevelt. Moreover, by examining the important issues of anti-Asian and anti-Mexican discrimination, this study reveals the limitations of Truman's liberalism in the areas of immigration and naturalisation policy. Mirroring recent interpretations of his contribution to the African-American struggle for racial equality, this article concludes that Truman's immigration initiatives largely originated in either Cold War expediency or maneuvering for political advantage, rather than a heartfelt commitment to reform.

T1  - 'Race' and the disorders of identity: Rethinking difference, the relation to the other and a politics of the commons
AN  - 1708525575; 201528692
AB  - Have issues around identity, difference, 'mixedness' reached an impasse? If so, what displacements in terms of analytical framework would open the way for a new politics? These are the underlying thoughts that guide the arguments in this article towards a position that is in solidarity with a politics of the commons. To do so, it draws from the kind of approaches developed in the work of those who emphasise the more-than-one, relational character of subjectivity, such as Bracha Ettinger, Gilbert Simondon, Karen Barad, Andy Clark and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, to outline an analytical framework that breaks with the privilege of sameness, identity and individualism in sustaining relations of power that rely on the dividing strategies of power to maintain oppressions of one kind or another.

T1  - School Segregation and the Secondary-School Achievements of Youth in the Netherlands
AN  - 1512220426; 201408897
AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on the relationship between school segregation and youth educational outcomes in general, and educational inequalities in particular. Using data from a longitudinal Dutch cohort study, we test whether the ethnic composition (operationalised as both ethnic diversity and the share of minority ethnic students) or the socio-economic composition of the secondary schools which youth attend have any bearing on their academic achievement in the third year of secondary school, controlling for prior achievement. We find students of similar background characteristics and prior achievements to perform better, on average, if they attend secondary schools with higher levels of socio-economic status. The ethnic composition of youths' secondary schools is not associated with their educational achievement after school socio-economic composition is considered. However, despite the association between school composition and students' academic achievement, school composition accounts for little, if any, of the observed inequalities in secondary-school achievement across ethnic or social background. Importantly, even when taking a set of key individual background and school characteristics into account, including youths' prior achievement levels, socio-economic status and school composition, several inequalities in secondary-school achievement along socio-economic and ethnic lines persist.

T1  - The Influence of Race, Class, and Metropolitan Area Characteristics on African-American Residential Segregation
AN  - 1494751559; 201402154
AB  - Sociologists and other scholars have debated the causes of continuing residential segregation for several decades. Social class has been largely discounted as a substantial determinant of residential segregation by race, but recent studies have brought renewed attention to class variables. The present study reassesses the role of social class, using household income, while also considering metropolitan area characteristics. This study expands on prior research by examining residential segregation between black-alone and white-alone households with 2000 decennial Census data for all U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) with at least 200,000 or more black population or 1,000,000 total population (60 MSAs total), using both spatial unevenness (dissimilarity) and two types of experiential (i.e., contextual) indicators (exposure indices), measuring socioeconomic status (SES) with a greater range and number of income levels than in past research, and using multivariate models to account for metropolitan area characteristics. We find that both dissimilarity and exposure measures are significantly associated with household income-black households with higher household incomes live in neighborhoods with greater exposure to whites and lower isolation from other blacks than do black households with lower incomes. Additionally, a number of MSA-level characteristics-several of which have not been considered in previous research-are substantially associated with black/white residential segregation. We interpret these findings in the context of spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives, and conclude that racial segregation is at least partly based on class.

T1  - The dynamics of intergroup helping: The case of subtle bias against Latinos
AN  - 1622296898; 201438342
AB  - Despite the traditional importance of Latinos in the U.S., the growing Latino population, and evidence of group-based disparities, psychological studies of discrimination against Latinos are surprisingly rare. The present research investigated the relationship between prejudice against Latinos and subtle bias, specifically the degree to which people offer autonomy-oriented relative to dependency-oriented assistance to a Latina in need. Participants read scenarios that described concrete social problems faced by particular Latinas, African Americans, or Whites and then indicated their support for forms of helping. Participants higher in prejudice against Latinos, assessed with an adaptation of the Modern Racism Scale, were less likely to offer autonomy-oriented help, and significantly more so after reading scenarios about a Latina than about an African American or a White woman. These findings extend previous work by identifying, experimentally, subtle bias against Latinas in helping and directly implicate the role of prejudice against Latinos in this process.

T1  - 'It's not written on their skin like it is ours': Greek letter organizations in the age of the multicultural imperative
AN  - 1494300118; 201402054
AB  - Today's students wrestle with the continued salience of racial identity on campuses that encourage the celebration of 'diversity' while at once digesting messages that the USA is now largely 'post-racial'. Based on data collected through fieldwork observation, focus groups and in-depth interviews with a local Multicultural Greek Council for fraternities and sororities, we argue that 'multicultural' student organizations engage in a variety of racial identity tactics that simultaneously constrain and enable the perception of their racial identities. By relying on the two cultural narratives of multiculturalism -- abstract and organizational -- members of Greek organizations that do not conform to the White/Black binary can construct identities and a movement understood as rational, progressive and generally innocuous. Yet, in practice, the dominant expectations to perform 'multiculturalism' were manifest in narrow, essentialist and singular expressions of ethnic pride as an oppositional identity to Anglo-conformity and color-blindness, rather than an embrace of pluralism and multiculturalism per se. By highlighting how members of multicultural student organizations navigate this troubling paradox, our study raises important questions about the concept of multiculturalism, especially as it is constructed and enacted by the millennial generation.

T1  - New evidence on racial and ethnic disparities in homeownership in the United States from 2001 to 2010
AN  - 1559007090; 201431981
AB  - Using 2001-2010 homeownership data for the United States we analyze changes in racial and ethnic disparities between whites and blacks, Asians, Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics. We employ Integrated Public Use Microdata (IPUMS) combined with local credit scores and house price to income ratios. Controlling for demographic, income, wealth, employment, and housing characteristics, we find no significant differences between whites and Asians, Mexicans, or Cubans. Conversely, blacks and Puerto Ricans remain substantially disadvantaged. We conduct further analysis for the 2001-2003, 2004-2007, and 2008-2010 periods of the housing boom and collapse. Blacks and Puerto Ricans experienced decreased disparities during the peak years of the boom. Puerto Rican parity with whites continued to improve during the crash while gains among blacks eroded. The results suggest the homeownership differences between whites, Asians, Mexicans, and Cubans are apparently explained by socioeconomic status while racial disparities among blacks and Puerto Ricans evolved but continue to persist.

T1  - Sexist Humor and Beliefs that Justify Societal Sexism
AN  - 1622295257; 201438253
AB  - Research suggests that sexist humor creates a context that justifies the expression of prejudice against women. The present research investigates whether sexist humor has broader social consequences related to societal sexism. An experiment supported our hypothesis that men higher in hostile sexist attitudes express beliefs that justify the gender status-quo to a greater degree after exposure to sexist humor versus neutral humor or non- humorous sexist material. Specifically, male participants higher in hostile sexism reported greater acceptance of current gender relations and greater acceptance of societal devaluation of women after reading sexist jokes than after reading neutral (nonsexist) jokes or non-humorous sexist material.

T1  - Social Capital, Employment and Occupational Status of the New Immigrants in Canada
AN  - 1504422936; 201405507
AB  - Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants in Canada (LSIC), this study examines the role of social capital in the labour market integration of new immigrants in Canada, utilizing various measures of social capital and treating employment and occupational Socio-Economic Scale (SES) as the indicators of labour market integration. The findings show that visible minority immigrants have significantly lower levels of employment and SES compared to white immigrants. Furthermore, social capital contributes significantly to an increased likelihood of employment and also to higher SES positions. However, the effect of social capital varies by the types of social capital, ethno-racial origins, as well as forms of economic integration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Why we stay': Immigrants' motivations for remaining in communities impacted by anti-immigration policy
AN  - 1622296440; 201438446
AB  - Although restrictive immigration policy is intended to reduce incentives for unauthorized immigrants to remain in the United States, many immigrants remain in their U.S. community despite the anti-immigration climate surrounding them. This study explores motivations shaping immigrants' intentions to stay in Arizona after passage of Senate Bill 1070 in 2010, one of the most restrictive immigration policies in recent decades. We conducted three focus groups in a large metropolitan city in Arizona with Mexican immigrant parents (N = 25). Themes emerging from the focus groups described multiple and interlocking personal, family and community, and contemporary sociopolitical motivations to stay in their community, and suggest that some important motivating factors have evolved as a result of immigrants' changing environment. Implications for research and social policy reform are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race and Gender Concordance: Strategy to Reduce Healthcare Disparities or Red Herring? Evidence from a Qualitative Study
AN  - 1494749890; 201402140
AB  - Healthcare treatment differences persist for African Americans even after controlling for socioeconomic status (van Ryn and Burke 2000). Although blacks represent a sizable percentage of the middle class, most disparities research does not address class heterogeneity. Furthermore, research indicates patient-provider race concordance may mitigate racial disparities in health care (Laveist and Neru-jeter in J Health Soc Behav 43(3):296-306, 2002; IOM in Unequal treatment: confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care. National Academies Press, Washington, 2002). This study explores race and gender preference for black middle-class women in healthcare settings. The study uses in-depth interviews and focus groups to explore the experiences of thirty African American women between 38 and 67 in a large urban area. The majority of respondents expressed a strong preference for a female OB/GYN (of any race) while 9 preferred a female primary care provider (of any race). Although the women did not express an explicit race preference, they had a strong affinity for black female providers. Importantly, respondents complicated the idea of provider-level race preference by noting that other site-level factors like wait times and the site's racial composition affected their racial preferences. Although increasing racial diversity among providers is generally positive, respondents suggest that alone will not ameliorate racial disparities. The complexities of the healthcare encounter, including time pressure, clinical uncertainty, and the patient's desire for expertise regardless of race or gender, all impinge on respondents' race preferences. Lastly, women noted that site-level factors may be conflated with the race of provider such that having a black provider does not necessarily lead to better care or protect women from discrimination or bias.

T1  - Where in the World Is Juan -- and What Color Is He? The Geography of Latina/o Racial Identity in Southern California
AN  - 1492601305; 201400216
AB  - Recently there has been a robust discussion on the question of Latina/o racial subjectivity, particularly whether Latinas/os are more apt to identify as "white" or as people of color. Scholars focused on contemporary identification patterns have examined key variables, including age, education, income, and nativity in an effort to understand Latinas/os' racial choices. However, dimensions of time and space are frequently unanalyzed. Focusing on the seven-county region of Southern California -- home to the United States' largest concentration of Latinas/os -- we use the American Community Survey (2008-10) to consider a range of variables, including spatial and temporal characteristics, to better understand Latina/o, especially Mexican American, racial subjectivity. Focusing on Latinas/os who identify as either "white" or "some other race" and utilizing a regression analysis to isolate the relative impact of each variable, we find that Latinas/os who live in more segregated neighborhoods as well as those who live among a high proportion of Latinas/os, are more likely to identify as "some other race.".

T1  - Racial identity and depressive symptoms among Black emerging adults: The moderating effects of neighborhood racial composition
AN  - 1373429289; 201328618
AB  - In the current study, we explored patterns of change in Black emerging adults' racial identity beliefs during the transition to adulthood, assessed neighborhood racial composition effects on Black emerging adults' racial identity beliefs, and tested the moderating effects of neighborhood racial composition on the associations between Black emerging adults' racial identity beliefs and depressive symptoms over time. Participants in the current study included 570 Black adolescents (52% female) who were transitioning into adulthood (senior year of high school through 5 years post- high school). We did not find average patterns of change in Black emerging adults' racial identity beliefs over time. Further, neighborhood racial composition did not predict participants' beginning status or growth in racial identity beliefs over time. We, however, found evidence that neighborhood racial composition may moderate the associations between Black emerging adults' racial identity beliefs and symptoms of depression over time. Findings from the current study underscore the importance of considering how the larger social context may interact with individuals' racial identity beliefs to influence Black emerging adults' psychological health.

T1  - Racial And Gender Discrimination In The Stress Process: Implications For African American Women's Health And Well-Being
AN  - 1417526812; 201332027
AB  - In recent decades, sociologists have increasingly adopted an intersectionality framework to explore and explain the complex and interconnected nature of inequalities in the areas of race, class, and gender. Using an inclusion-centered approach and a sample of 204 low-socioeconomic-status (SES) African American women, the authors theorize and explore the role of racial and gender discrimination in the stress process. Analyses examine relationships between social stressors (racial and gender discrimination) and individual stressors occurring in each of six distinct social contexts. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the effects of racial and gender discrimination as compared to individual stressors on three indicators of mental health and well-being. Findings suggest that racial and gender discrimination increases risk for poor health and low well-being, working both directly and indirectly through increased vulnerability to individual stressors. This research demonstrates the value of a more comprehensive study of stressors that influence the health of low-SES African American women and other multiply disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Colonizing intersectionality: replicating racial hierarchy in feminist academic arguments
AN  - 1792351062
AB  - In this article I use tools of critical and poststructural discourse analysis to examine a particular rhetorical frame adopted by some European social scientists and philosophers dealing with the feminist concept of intersectionality. These scholars must negotiate a complex discursive terrain framed by what David Theo Goldberg calls 'racial Europeanization,' a metadiscursive regime that denies the continuing existence of European race and racisms. The result is to suppress the availability of conceptual tools that will allow people to recognize, analyze, and debate what might count as structural racisms and how racial differences can be negotiated effectively. Acceding to this suppression restricts the tools available when critics must engage with racial arguments in criticizing US intersectionality. I examine here three cases in which critics fail to give due attention to the imbrication of race, nation, and power in their arguments, the women they target, and the forms of intersectionality they wish to critique. The critics utilize structures of argument that evoke histories of racial hierarchy and colonialism, treating the intersectionality of US women of color as a site to colonize and control. They deploy rhetorics that map closely to structures of thinking described by Albert Memmi in his description of colonial racism. I demonstrate how the critiques of intersectionality frame US feminist scholars of color and their constituencies by 'depersonalizing' and 'collectivizing' them through what Memmi calls 'the mark of the plural,' through binary and hierarchical rhetorics, and through 'fixing' the nature of the black feminists who introduced the concept of intersectionality as a theoretical tool. The unacknowledged expressions of racial privilege that characterize these critiques demonstrate that feminists need to transform the terms of reading and writing to take responsibility for the ways feminist discourses function as technologies of power.

T1  - Becoming a Migrant: Vietnamese Emigration to East Asia
AN  - 1347783244; 201318665
AB  - Since the early 1990s several million men and women from Southeast Asia's lower socioeconomic classes have migrated to East Asia with a temporary worker visa or a spousal visa. This article is based on five years of ongoing fieldwork in migrants' communities of origin in rural Vietnam and in places of destination in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. The authors make three contributions: first, they argue that the categorization of migrants as either "workers" or "wives" in research obscures the complex trajectories and motives involved in the process of "becoming a migrant." Second, they challenge studies that unquestioningly invoke social network approaches to migration. Instead, social networks should be regarded as a double-edged sword for emigrants because personal networks are embedded in a powerful migration industry. Third, they contend that migration outcomes and levels of success are, in part, influenced by processes taking place before departure. This article sheds light on the tension between migrants' agency and the structural constraints faced by candidates seeking to migrate from Vietnam, and from Southeast Asia more broadly.

T1  - Uyghur Support for Economic Justice in Urumchi
AN  - 1347782829; 201318971
AB  - There has been little research conducted on economic beliefs among Uyghurs in Xinjiang, although they are part of the reason Uyghurs have developed feelings of relative deprivation and unfairness. Do most Uyghurs support economic individualism, which holds that the poor are responsible for their misfortunes, economic inequality is good, and the government should not interfere in the economy? Or do they endorse economic communitarianism, which holds that the government shall provide for the poor and reduce inequality via intervention? Are there some people in the Uyghur community who are more economically communitarian than others? Are Uyghur economic beliefs related to the usual socio-demographic measures such as age, sex, education, occupational attainment and income? Is there a religious influence on Uyghur economic attitudes? If not, how can Uyghur economic preferences be accounted for? This paper addresses these questions using data from a survey conducted in Urumchi in 2007. It shows that the vast majority of Uyghurs endorse economic communitarianism. In addition to Islamic orthodoxy, Uyghur consciousness is related to this endorsement. However, Uyghur socioeconomic status is not correlated with their economic preferences. This is partly because Uyghur-Han inequality affects Uyghur attitudes more than intra-group differentiation in social status among Uyghurs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reframing craniometry: human exceptionalism and the production of racial knowledge
AN  - 1792349460
AB  - Focusing on the nineteenth century practice of craniometry, this paper considers how strategies of producing racial 'knowledge' played a key role in the development of ideas about the human. Supplementing the familiar claim that nineteenth century racial craniometry was designed to biologise longstanding aesthetic prejudices about variations in human physical appearance, the paper offers a more specific understanding of the role of this practice in biologising race. Taking up the post-Linnaean context in which a biological conception of race was elaborated, it considers how early nineteenth century debates about the unique and exceptional status of the human - classically identified with the soul or mind - centred upon the head. The practice of craniometry, it is suggested, can be understood in this context, as its centrality in the emergence of a biological conception of race is traced to an effort to demonstrate the material existence of the mind. The possibility proposed in this paper, therefore, is that particular physical differences between various peoples came to be regarded as racially significant in the nineteenth century attempt to determine the exceptional status of the human.

T1  - Intergenerational Transfer in Russian-Israeli Immigrant Families: Parental Social Mobility and Children's Integration
AN  - 1551001466; 201429090
AB  - Existing research on immigrant youth in North America and Europe points to the salient role of parental pre-migration socio-economic status for the second generation's integration. Israel offers a unique opportunity to examine inter-generational transfer, drawing on the experiences of former Soviet immigrants. The study explored parent-child influences in terms of educational attainment and social mobility among 40 immigrant families, of whom half were status-stable or upwardly mobile and half downwardly mobile in the new country. The findings suggest that parental success or failure to maintain or improve their occupational and social status upon migration has a strong bearing upon the children, although not always in the predictable direction. In most cases, the upwardly mobile first generation boosted their children's motivation for integration and success. However, children of downwardly mobile immigrants were driven to compensate for their parents' status losses by overcoming barriers and improving their educational and labour-market outcomes. Thus, not only the first generation's human capital but also the returns on their skills and social mobility in the host country are important in the successful integration of the second generation.

T1  - More Like Us: The Effect of Immigrant Generation on College Success in Mathematics
AN  - 1283643126; 201303249
AB  - This article investigates the impact of immigrant generation on student's performance in college calculus courses and examines the extent to which the observed patterns corroborate or contradict various assimilation theories. It goes beyond past studies of the relationship between immigrant generation and mathematics achievement that focused primarily on middle and high school students and typically excluded foreign students. Our principal finding is that foreign students and the 1.25 generation earned the highest grades, on average, even after controlling for race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Our findings provide partial support for the immigrant advantage theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Whiteness, racism, and Afrikaner identity in post-apartheid South Africa
AN  - 1492602054; 201400226
AB  - This article explores the production of post-apartheid Afrikaner identity in South Africa. Centred around the private sphere of the braai, the article draws on discursive psychology to investigate the participants' dilemmas and struggles over their identity as Afrikaners, South Africans, and Africans, and the ways in which these identities are being redefined. The 'backstage' talk that is usually reserved for fellow whites or Afrikaners illustrates a clear difference between public and private constructions of Afrikaner identity. While the participants rejected many stereotypes of Afrikaner identity, they simultaneously recycled key discourses underlying apartheid ideology, particularly discourses of black incompetence and whites under threat. Participants generally claimed status as 'Africans' but strongly resisted assimilation with 'Africa' or a broader African identity. The article concludes that the construction of the Afrikaner community as embattled and systematically oppressed might provide powerful support for extremism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Relationship Between Socioeconomic Factors, Wellbeing, and Homosexuality in the Theatrical Profession
AN  - 1373427162; 201328622
AB  - This article relates to the theory suggesting that there is a prevalence of male homosexuality within the theatrical profession that can be explained through male performers becoming homosexual due to their low socioeconomic position. In a questionnaire-based study, the socioeconomic status (SES) is measured of 121 homosexual performers who considered themselves to have been heterosexual at the time of joining the profession, and results are compared with a control group of 121 heterosexual male performers. The experimental group was chosen in this way due to the suggestion of the hypothesis that the change in sexual orientation occurs after the man begins performing professionally. Results were not significant and little difference was noted in any of the parameters of SES, including annual earnings and home ownership. However, a marginal though insignificant increase in SES was noted in the experimental group of homosexual men. Consequently, existing theories for homosexuality and possible reasons for the high prevalence within the performing profession are discussed; the notions of adult performing and creativity being extensions of childhood gender atypical behavior are considered and possible links between sexual orientation and these traits. Elements of genetic heritability of homosexuality are likewise implicated. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Selling the Farm to Buy the Cow": The Narrativized Consequences of "Black Names" From Within the African American Community
AN  - 1283641144; 201303263
AB  - This article examines how "Black names" have become a trope for deficit beliefs about Black people in the United States and about Blackness more broadly. In data from two qualitative studies conducted with one group of African American secondary students and second group of African American alumni from a historically black college, participants' narratives of everyday life reflect the impact of racialization and the extent to which members of both groups attempt to circumvent racialization in their personal and professional lives. The authors identify naming as a cultural right that is threatened within the Black community. They use the principle tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) alongside discussions of "race" in a sociolinguistic analysis of participants' discussions of race and naming. The authors take up CRT's call for narrative as a critical component for revealing and analyzing the significance and impact of race. Findings from the study illustrate that African Americans struggle with naming and the implications for Black names that influence personal choices they make regardless of their age, education level, and socioeconomic status. There is a consequential aspect to Black names that imposes challenges in refracting the deficit constructions of Blackness that are attached to them.

T1  - Importation, SES-selective acculturation, and the weaker SES-health gradients of Mexican immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1266145761; 201300453
AB  - Previous studies find U.S. immigrants have weaker socioeconomic gradients in health relative to non-Hispanic Whites and their U.S.-born co-ethnics. Several explanations have been advanced but few have been tested empirically. We use data from the Mexican Family Life Survey and the U.S. National Health Interview Survey, including longitudinal data in the former measuring socioeconomic status (SES) and health previous to emigration, to test if (1) immigrants "import" their gradients from the sending country, or if (2) they may be changing as a result of SES-graded acculturation among Mexican migrant men in two health indicators: obesity and current smoking. We find evidence consistent with the first hypothesis: the gradients of migrants measured prior to coming to the U.S. are not statistically different from those of nonmigrants, as the gradients of each are relatively weak. Although the gradients for obesity and smoking appear to weaken with time spent in the U.S., the differences are not significant, suggesting little support for the selective acculturation hypothesis.

T1  - Prosocial Involvement Among African American Young Adults: Considering Racial Discrimination and Racial Identity
AN  - 1037879043; 201231257
AB  - Prosocial involvement is conceptualized as support for or engaging in behaviors that contribute to or benefit African American communities. The current study examines the relationship between prosocial involvement and race-related factors among 303 African American college students. Using two underlying dimensions of prosocial involvement, prosocial attitudes and prosocial behaviors, models were tested to examine racial discrimination and racial identity as predictors of prosocial involvement. Overall, participants showed strong support for prosocial involvement. Racial discrimination, racial centrality, and private regard were positively related to both dimensions of prosocial involvement. There was also a positive association between nationalist and assimilation ideology with prosocial attitudes.

T1  - The colour line and the colour scale in the twentieth century
AN  - 1567049360; 201435066
AB  - Some more recent evidence supports Du Bois' prediction that the twentieth century would prove the century of the colour line. It indicates that men have always and everywhere shown a preference for fair complexioned women as sexual partners, whereas males seeking a mate are rarely disadvantaged by a dark complexion. In the employment market in the USA, a dark complexion is a significant disadvantage for both males and females. Though there is no properly comparable evidence from other countries, there appears to be a widespread tendency for any negative valuation of darker skin colour to be incorporated into a scale of socio-economic status. In some situations a colour scale is replacing the colour line. Du Bois' reference to differences of colour has been largely superseded in English-speaking countries by references to differences of race. From a policy standpoint, the switch from colour to race has had both positive and negative consequences. From a sociological standpoint, it has made it more difficult to disaggregate the dimensions of social difference and to dispel the confusions engendered by ideas of racial difference.

T1  - An American Drag Queen in West Berlin: The Negotiation of Homosexual Identity, Transgressive Behavior and Social Acceptance in late 1960s and early 1970s West Germany
AN  - 962490341
AB  - My work analyzes a number of confrontations between Tobi Marsh, a gay drag queen, and his German-Jewish landlord, Stark, in late 1960s and early 1970s West Berlin. Based upon an extensive personal interview with Marsh, my work uses subjective testimony to examine the complexity of lived-experience for gay men in Bundesrepublik society right at the time when the West Germany government extended full political and legal equality to gay men. Marsh's testimony details two separate incidents during which Stark, who knew Marsh was openly gay and performed as a drag queen, attacked Marsh's sexual orientation. While perhaps not significant in and of itself, a closer look at Marsh's account reveals that Stark made use of very specific social contexts in order to condemn Marsh's sexual identity. In fact, on both occasions some other social transgression entirely served as a catalyst to the confrontation, one a racial transgression and another an ethno-religious transgression. In both cases, however, Stark made use of the situation of a "double-transgression" to censure Marsh and his company first and foremost as homosexuals. At the same time, the sexual nature of Stark's outbursts reveals that Stark was actually concerned about the tenuous standing and respectability of his own person and household as a likewise marginalized individual in West German society. Indeed, Stark's attacks on Marsh's homosexuality were disguised attempts to assert his own position in "respectable" West German society at Marsh's expense. Marsh's run-ins with Stark, then, both add to the growing literature on the various forms of informal prejudice suffered by gay men in post-World War II West German society and serve as a larger lens through which to view the rich complexity of life for gay men in a country still undergoing democratization where social belonging was being negotiated along a number of fronts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Does status affect intergroup perceptions of humanity?
AN  - 1023027207; 201223674
AB  - Across three studies, we examined whether ingroup status may affect intergroup perceptions of humanity. In Studies 1 and 2, we considered real groups: Northern versus Southern Italians; in Study 3, we manipulated the socioeconomic status of two minimal groups. In all studies, members of higher status groups perceived the ingroup as more human than the outgroup, while members of lower status groups did not assign a privileged human status to the ingroup. Such findings were obtained using different implicit techniques: the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and the Go/No-go Association Task (GNAT). Further, results suggest that the different perceptions of humanity may depend on the stereotypic traits generally ascribed to higher and lower status groups. The implications of results for infrahumanization research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Gender roles and ethnic income inequality in Urumchi
AN  - 1037875433; 201231263
AB  - This paper examines the effect of gender roles on earnings differentials between Han Chinese and Uyghurs in Urumchi, China, using survey data (N = 1,600) from Urumchi in 2005. It finds sizeable earnings differentials between Han Chinese and Uyghurs. However, the differences in income between Uyghur men and Han men fade away when socioeconomic variables are controlled for. No similar patterns are found among women. Earnings differentials between Uyghur women and Han women and between Uyghurs and Han Chinese disappear after the measures for family responsibilities are introduced into the earnings equation. The differences in socioeconomic status and family responsibilities between Uyghur women and Han women underlie the aggregate income inequality between Uyghurs and Han Chinese.

T1  - [Organizational (Performance] of Race): The Co-Constitutive Performance of Race and School Board in Durham, NC
AN  - 1429623724; 201335793
AB  - This essay addresses the co-constitutive performance of race and organization through a close reading of two racially divided Durham, NC school board meetings that took place in 2005. The analysis is grounded in an analytical framework that treats performance as organizing and organization as performance. We demonstrate how conflict over the "proper" performance of a school board, as either a business emphasizing efficiency or a public service emphasizing efficacy, is simultaneously a negotiation of racialized subject positions. Our analysis illustrates how racial identities are made meaningful in a contemporary context, as racial identities are taken up, mapped onto, and resisted by individuals and their bodies.

T1  - The Ethnic Entrepreneurial Transition: Recent Trends in British Indian Self-Employment
AN  - 1023030570; 201223879
AB  - The Indian community in the UK is exemplifying an 'ethnic entrepreneurial transition'. Impressive educational credentials, an increasing presence in the professions and diversification into new and emerging sectors are gradually changing the profile of Indian entrepreneurship. This paper reports on the growing convergence of Indian self-employment with white-owned businesses, a trend first noted in 2003. We examine the factors behind this growing harmonisation and identify grounds for qualified optimism. A number of policy implications are also identified, particularly in respect to the quantitative preoccupation of government measures to promote self-employment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, SES, and Obesity Among Men
AN  - 1081863946; 201235242
AB  - Over the last decade, obesity has increased significantly among men but few national studies have empirically examined racial and socioeconomic differences in obesity among men. In this paper, we utilized logistic regression to evaluate the potential associations that race and socioeconomic status may have with obesity among men in the National Survey of American Life: an in-person household survey of non-institutionalized U.S. blacks and whites who lived in communities where at least 10% of the community residents were black Americans. A greater proportion of black men were likely to be obese than white men, but no interaction among race, SES, and obesity was detected when potential confounding variables were included. There was not a relationship between SES and obesity for white men, but there was an apparent positive relationship between SES and obesity for black men that did not remain significant in adjusted models. No relationship was found between age and obesity among black men, though white men who were 55 and older were more likely than those 18-34 to be obese in confounder adjusted models. Among white men, no relationships were found between obesity and education, household income, or marital status. Black men in the lowest income category were less likely to be obese than those in the highest income category, in bivariate but not adjusted models. These findings suggest that the way racial, economic, stress and behavioral factors combine to affect obesity in black and white men may be different. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Identity, ethnicity, and the Caribbean homeland in an era of globalization
AN  - 1792709235
AB  - The paper looks at Caribbean territorial identity at the crossroads of the new forces of globalization. It offers a topology of Caribbean identities along an ethno-cultural axis. It looks at identity as an area of change and contestation. In developing the ideas of Caribbean identity the paper looks at the concept of the Caribbean homeland as a constituent element in defining regional and territorial arena of identity formation. It attempts to show in looking at the ethno-Caribbean homeland the contestations over self-definition that are being engaged and how multiple identities emerge. It argues that it was a fiction that Caribbean peoples were always living in uncontested territory of land and of the mind. The paper points to contestations over residence as the defining denominator of identity both at home and overseas.

T1  - Negotiating Multiple Identities: How African-American Gay and Bisexual Men Persist at a Predominantly White Institution
AN  - 964199727; 201207428
AB  - This consensual qualitative research (CQR) study explores factors contributing to the persistence of African-American gay and bisexual men at a predominately White institution (PWI). Eight participants consistently noted that involvement with an African-American community was crucial to navigating the challenges of attending a PWI. Participants reported that their racial identity was more salient than their sexual orientation in creating social support, and they described feeling uncomfortable using lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) resources. Implications, including education about sexual orientation within African-American campus communities, LGBT outreach to communities of color, and continued institutional support for African-American campus organizations, are discussed.

T1  - Framed Peoples: The Discourse of Minority Elites and the Language Question in Ukraine
AN  - 964195722; 201207378
AB  - This article examines zero-sum competition among elites in multi-ethnic states. It analyzes how Russophone minority elites in Ukraine frame their discourse of the state's language policies in the field of general education. Viewing the issue through the lens of a historical positivist/constructivist dichotomy, this article finds that as the Ukrainian state pursues nationalizing policies, minority elites employ a discourse intended to recruit members to their in-group and prevent defections to an ethnic Ukrainian identity. While there is little or no evidence of an ethnic Russian mobilization in the discourse, the article does not find that to be a sign of an entrenched civic understanding of nationhood. Rather, it argues that this is a sign of elite competition for maximum constituency. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Facial reactions reveal that slim is good but fat is not bad: Implicit and explicit measures of body-size bias
AN  - 964195165; 201207293
AB  - Facial electromyography (EMG) was used to gauge emotional responding towards images of slim and overweight individuals, and findings were compared with data from a series of alternative measures including two implicit attitudinal procedures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit measures of anti-fat prejudice and discriminatory behavior. Images of slim individuals elicited EMG responses consistent with more positive affect. Data from both the IRAP and IAT indicated higher levels of bias than were revealed on the explicit measures, and the IRAP also corroborated the EMG pattern by indicating responses consistent with pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias. The IRAP was moderately correlated with both EMG and the IAT and was the only measure to predict behavioral intentions. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - NEIGHBORHOOD DISORDER AND INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY CAPACITY: HOW INCIVILITIES INFORM THREE DOMAINS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT
AN  - 919903559; 201201717
AB  - This article examines contextual models to bring together the disorder and community capacity perspectives, since both are grounded in social (dis)organization theory and cumulative causation. We analyze how individual and neighborhood characteristics, social and physical disorder, and crime affect three individual community capacity outcomes: city quality of life, neighborhood safety, and household moving intentions. The "broken windows" downward spiral suggests that neighborhood incivilities may decrease multiple psychosocial assessments, or, individual community capacities. Consistent with prior research, we find that social and physical disorder decreases all three outcomes. Second, we find that both disorders also mediate neighborhood effects, including socioeconomic status and residential stability. Third, these direct and indirect disorder effects are not altered by prior victimization or neighborhood crime rates. Reducing disorder will, in turn, improve three distinct domains and geographic scales of individual community capacity, and can also reduce the adverse effects of other local area capacity deficits.

T1  - Henry Ossawa Tanner's Negotiation of Race and Art: Challenging "The Unknown Tanner"
AN  - 907929310; 201124797
AB  - This essay is a response to an article recently published by Will South titled "A Missing Question Mark: The Unknown Henry Ossawa Tanner" in the journal Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide. Tanner was the foremost African American artist of the late 19th century. He has emerged as an exemplar of Black achievement in the arts and is now included in the canon of American art of that period. While Tanner labored to remove the equation of race as the defining factor for his artistic output, he never lost sight of his racial identity. South's article suggests otherwise and he reconstructs Tanner as a "tragic mulatto" who, on several occasions, passed as White to advance his career and social standing. South's conclusion seriously jeopardizes Tanner's hard-fought reputation and greatly diminishes his celebrated cultural significance. I weigh South's evidence against documented sources and conclude that Tanner unabashedly affirmed his "Blackness" throughout his life and art.

T1  - Is Psychological Science A-Cultural?
AN  - 914767866; 201200155
AB  - The history of psychological science, as it has intersected with ethnoracial, cultural, and other marginalized domains of group difference, is replete with disinterest, dismissal, or denigration of these diverse forms of psychological experience. This has led some to wonder whether psychological science is a-cultural, or even anti-cultural in orientation. Assessment of this provocative proposition first requires exploration of three composite questions: (1) What is culture?, (2) What is science?, and (3) What is psychological science? Based on brief consideration of these composite questions -- which are remarkably complex in their own right -- I argue that psychological science is not, has never been, and indeed cannot in principle be a-cultural. Instead, like all forms of knowing, psychological science emerges at particular historical moments to achieve particular goals that are motivated by particular interests. Throughout much of the history of psychological science, these goals and interests were tied to ideologically suspect agendas that contemporary psychologists are right to repudiate. The interesting question becomes whether psychology's knowledge practices can be disentangled from this earlier ideological contamination to furnish the discipline with viable methods. I propose that psychological science can in fact be so disentangled; nevertheless, the resulting methods are never adopted or deployed outside of culturally constituted interests, objectives, and motivations, thereby requiring ongoing critical engagement with the subtexts of disciplinary knowledge production. In fact, there seem to be important ways in which psychology's scientific aspirations hobble disciplinary inquiry into the human condition that has motivated multicultural psychologists to consider alternative paradigms of inquiry.

T1  - Is Multicultural Psychology A-Scientific? Diverse Methods for Diversity Research
AN  - 914767860; 201200137
AB  - This article asks, and answers three separate questions: What is multicultural psychology? What is psychological science? Are multicultural psychology and (empirical/positivist) psychological science incompatible? A brief overview of the history of science is provided emphasizing the emancipatory impulses behind a modernist, empirical, positivist approach to science. It is argued that such an approach is not incompatible with multicultural psychology. The author concludes that multicultural psychological will be strengthened if psychologists draw upon both qualitative and quantitative methods, including those that come from a positivist tradition, when investigating psychological and social issues as they affect diverse populations.

T1  - Tongan grandparents and grandchildren: The impact of grandparenting
AN  - 902085226; 201122331
AB  - This article is part of a study on the phenomenon of grandparenting in the Tongan culture among grandparents and grandchildren living in the state of Hawaii and the island kingdom of Tonga (Vakalahi et al., 2008). Explored in this article are grandparent-related family, social, cultural, spiritual, systemic, and economic-based factors that serve as possible sources of risk and/or protection for grandchildren who are expectant carriers of cultural customs and traditions. Grandparenting remains intrinsic to the Tongan cultural structure and central to the survival of the culture, particularly as Tongan immigrants experience cultural duality and acculturation. Because grandchildren are central to the preservation of the culture, understanding how the practice of grandparenting impacts them is critical. Themes identified as possible risk factors included cultural duality, language and acculturative barriers, low socioeconomic status, and low educational level. Possible protective factors included unconditional love, reciprocity, loyalty, discipline, and prayers. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Identities and inequalities: an examination of the role of racial identity in the formation of social capital inside a voluntary youth organization
AN  - 1792351329
AB  - This ethnographic study provides empirical illustrations of patterns of racial homophily and network ties within a voluntary youth association. The paper seeks to examine the role of racial identity and its relationship to the formation of social capital among a diverse group of youth participants. Drawing on narrative data, this article explores the kinds of organizational experiences that promote the development of interracial ties as well as how the construction of racial identity influences network formation and enhances social capital. The major findings are that racial homophily (staying within one's own group) are strongest among white participants while blacks are equally likely to form interracial ties with socially dissimilar peers as with socially similar peers. Some gendered and class differences also emerged. Institutional agents were also found to be important in helping youth participants bridge racial barriers.

T1  - New ethnicities and old classities: respectability and diaspora
AN  - 1792351265
AB  - This article explores the contrasts between the flexibility and openness of interethnic and diasporic identifications and the fixity of class distinctions in contemporary Britain. The author draws on fieldwork conducted in the Midlands area and a suburban town in the south east of England and traces the ways in which project participants mobilised their biographies and ancestries to express feelings of empathy and relatedness across black, white and Asian identities. The author discovered the same people articulated a strong sense of classed distinction between themselves and others who were thought to lack respectability, social ambition and mobility. These observations have led me to reflect upon the theoretical contrasts between what Stuart Hall has famously called 'new ethnicities' and what the author calls 'old classities'.

T1  - Narrating Identities: Schools as Touchstones of Endemic Marginalization
AN  - 902083794; 201122320
AB  - This article examines a racial awareness activity conducted as part of a community-wide change initiative at which we found that the majority of racial identity events occurred in schools. Given the prevalence of schools in participant narratives, we argue that schooling is a societal marker, or what we will call a touchstone, of racial identity formation and marginalization that is enacted on an interactional level and that reflected historical and present day relationships. .

T1  - 'Why is our love an issue?': same-sex marriage and the racial politics of the ordinary
AN  - 1792351222
AB  - This article analyzes the implicit white racial normativity underpinning the socio-legal struggle for same-sex marriage in Canada. I argue that discursive representations of 'ordinary lives' require alignment with terms of neoliberal citizenship - the privacy of property and intimacy - that hold whiteness as the unspoken yet aspirational ideal. As a contestation of heteronormative citizenship, same-sex marriage is not simply a politics of sexuality but also a politics of race.

T1  - Minority Stress and College Persistence Attitudes Among African American, Asian American, and Latino Students: Perception of University Environment as a Mediator
AN  - 887499272; 201118216
AB  - We examined whether perception of university environment mediated the association between minority status stress and college persistence attitudes after controlling for perceived general stress. Participants were 160 Asian American, African American, and Latino students who attended a predominantly White university. Results of a path model analysis showed that university environment was a significant mediator for the association between minority status stress and college persistence attitudes. Additionally, minority status stress was distinct from perceived general stress. Finally, the results from a multiple-group comparison indicated that the magnitude of the mediation effect was invariant across Asian American, African American, and Latino college students, thus supporting the generalizability of the mediation model.

T1  - Parental Racial Socialization and the Academic Achievement of African American Children: A Cultural-Ecological Approach
AN  - 862596161; 201109638
AB  - Using a cultural-ecological approach, this study examined: (a) associations between parental racial socialization and child academic achievement and (b) variations in these associations across child gender and family socio-economic status. Participants were 134 fifth grade African American children and their mothers. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to examine associations between two components of parental racial socialization (preparation for bias, pride development) and academic achievement (GPA) and the moderating effects of gender and SES on these associations. Preparation for bias and pride development did not significantly predict academic achievement. However, gender moderated the association between preparation for bias and academic achievement. Greater frequency of preparation for bias messages delivered to boys increased GPAs. However, as the frequency of preparation for bias messages delivered to girls increased, GPA decreased. SES did not significantly moderate the associations between either dimension of racial socialization and academic achievement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Movement in spaces of liminality: Chinese dance and immigrant identities
AN  - 862596087; 201109745
AB  - This paper explores the roles of immigrant dance in ethnic construction. It is based on participant observation and in-depth interviews with a Chinese dance organization in the US Midwest. Chinese dance in the US, a transnational cultural practice, solidifies a sense of belonging among Chinese immigrants. As these immigrants make sense of what it means to be Chinese and to do Chinese dance in contemporary American society, they reinvent their collective identity while holding on to primordial understandings of ethnicity rooted in the constructed ideas of ancestry and homeland. A case study of the ethnic construction theory, this research sheds light on the paradox of embodied immigrant identities: they are constructed through cultural practices and yet often understood as primordial, transnational and yet necessarily place-bound.

T1  - Law and Identity: Transnational Arranged Marriages and the Boundaries of Danishness
AN  - 852900538; 201103383
AB  - In Denmark, the practice of transnational arranged marriages among immigrants has stirred debate on several levels of society. One effect of the debate is a tightened regulation of family formation migration, seen as an effective means both of limiting the number of immigrants and of furthering processes of social integration. Within media-based and political debates, transnational marriages are frequently described as practices destructive both to individual freedom and to Danish national identity. Nonetheless, it is a practice in which both minority and majority citizens engage, one that frames both their family lives and their lives as citizens. This article analyses the dynamic relationship between public discourse and practices of transnational marriage. The first part describes how political and legislative perceptions of transnational (arranged) marriages are situated within a discussion of 'Danishness'. The second part describes how second-generation immigrants from Turkey and Pakistan, all of whom have married someone from their country of origin, articulate how public discourse on transnationally arranged marriages affects their lives. This part particularly focuses on the informants' expressions of autonomy and choice and their adaptations of such concepts to understandings of social belonging, inclusion and identity formation vis-a-vis the Danish nation-state.

T1  - Assimilation Choices Among Immigrant Families: Does School Context Matter?
AN  - 914766197; 201200156
AB  - This article explores the relationship between social context, measured in terms of school characteristics, and the assimilation of immigrant adolescents. First, it develops a measure of assimilation based on comparing immigrant adolescents to native peers within the same school. Second, it investigates whether immigrant adolescents' degree of assimilation varies systematically according to school socioeconomic status (SES). Third, it explores the role of parental and adolescent behavior in creating such variation. Results show that both Asian and Hispanic immigrant youth are less assimilated to native youths' substance use and delinquency patterns in lower-SES schools. This association can be explained by parenting behaviors and adolescent friendship choices for Asian youth, but not Hispanic youth. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - COMMUNITY INFLUENCES ON WHITE RACIAL ATTITUDES: What Matters and Why
AN  - 896180897; 201120190
AB  - Tracing the roots of racial attitudes in historical events and individual biographies has been a long-standing goal of race relations scholars. Recent years have seen a new development in racial attitude research: Local community context has entered the spotlight as a potential influence on racial views. The race composition of the locality has been the most common focus; evidence from earlier decades suggests that white Americans are more likely to hold anti-black attitudes if they live in areas where the African-American population is relatively large. However, an influential 2000 article argued that the socioeconomic composition of the white community is a more powerful influence on white attitudes: In low-socioeconomic status (SES) locales, "stress-inducing" deprivations and hardships in whites' own lives purportedly lead them to disparage blacks. The study reported here reassesses this "scapegoating" claim, using data from the 1998 to 2002 General Social Surveys linked to 2000 census information about communities. Across many dimensions of racial attitudes, there is pronounced influence of both local racial proportions and college completion rates among white residents. However, the economic dimension of SES exerts negligible influence on white racial attitudes, suggesting that local processes other than scapegoating must be at work.

T1  - Re-membering Black Greeks: Racial Memory and Identity in Stomp the Yard
AN  - 835111569; 201100499
AB  - Critical sociological analysis suggests that the film Stomp the Yard immerses its audience in a myopic legend of African American fraternities and sororities. Combining historical photos of Civil Rights leaders, traditions of 'stepping', tales of meritocratic social uplift, and romanticized aspects of historically black college or university (HBCU) culture, Stomp the Yard reveals a hyper-individualistic, conservative, and politically blunted form of historiography. Specifically, five ideological mythologies ground the film's construction of Civil Rights memory and racialized identities. These mythologies decisively fail to interrogate the complexity of black fraternities and sororities. In so doing, they invite a critical blindness to these organizations' role in past Civil Rights struggles as well as their intersection with contemporary issues such as classism, hazing, and resistance to contemporary forms of racism and racial inequality.

T1  - Cognitive and Language Skills of Turkish Children in Germany: A Comparison of the Second and Third Generation and Mixed Generational Groups
AN  - 1221407557; 201243984
AB  - The paper compares several generational groups of Turkish children in Germany with respect to cognitive skills and German language skills at an early age. Empirically, children of inter-marriages outperform the other groups of Turkish children in both tests while children with a first generation mother and a second generation father score worse than all others. All group differences regarding children's cognitive skills can be explained by the families' socio-economic status and educational resources. In contrast, with respect to children's language skills also parents' endowment with receiving country specific resources (e.g., parental German language proficiency) needs to be taken into account.

T1  - Reflections of a Latino junior scholar
AN  - 1030865380; 201227823
AB  - In November 2008, the United States elected its first person of color as president. Days after this historical event that brought much hope for improving racial and ethnic relations in the country, Marcelo Lucero, a 37-year-old Ecuadorian immigrant was killed in Queens, New York City (NYC) simply for being Latino. As a result of these two diametrically opposed events, I decided to reflect on my identity as a Latino junior scholar and my research over the coming the coming year. Much of my research centers on examining the violence to which children of immigrants are exposed in schools and its detrimental consequences. Like many other scholars, my research agenda reflects an aspect of my own biography. During graduate school, I had, and still have, an endless research desire to learn about the social forces that are linked to the exposure of children of immigrants to violence. When I transitioned into a tenure track position, I immersed myself in research and writing. Because I became so focused on the scholarship treadmill, I had no time to reflect on my new identity as a Latino scholar. That changed in November 2008. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race to College: The "Reverse Gap"
AN  - 868013796; 201113444
AB  - This article uses the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to establish that once socioeconomic status is considered, black Americans go to college at higher rates than whites. The outcome replicates numerous other studies that use different datasets and varying methods. Combining statistics and literature, I propose that blacks' superior educational investment is an empirical generalization. This leads to discussions of the black-white gap in education and the attitude-achievement paradox. The latter claims that black people have high educational aspirations but fail to act on those attitudes. But when considering the choice to invest in education, the attitude-achievement paradox evaporates. Black Americans have high educational aspirations and, when there are enough resources, act on those aspirations by going to college at higher rates than whites. The paper concludes with a theoretical explanation of why black people, more than whites, efficiently translate resources into educational investment. I use literature to show that in the United States, the bearers of light skin are afforded numerous informal opportunities that allow them to get higher returns out of a given level of human capital. Non-whites, on the other hand, have fewer informal opportunities, and they therefore deploy supra-normal efforts of skill acquisition as a strategy to overcome their informal disadvantage.

T1  - Chinese Children Among the Poor: Comparing U.S. Natives with Immigrants from Taiwan, Mainland China, and Hong Kong
AN  - 868013769; 201112984
AB  - Research on Chinese Americans often centers on successful economic incorporation in American society (e.g., model minority). Unfortunately, previous research has overlooked the changing economic circumstances of native- and foreign-born Chinese children, despite the fact that Chinese children living in America are diverse in socioeconomic status and geographic origin. In this paper, we use data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses to compare levels and changes in child poverty rates among U.S.-born Chinese and immigrants from Taiwan, Mainland China, and Hong Kong, and to investigate how changes in maternal employment and family structure (including cohabitation) contributed to the decline in poverty rates in the 1990s. Compared to other Asian Americans and non-Asians, Chinese children in the U.S. are less likely to live in poverty, thanks in part to more married-couple families and higher levels of maternal employment. Yet, child poverty rates vary among Chinese American subpopulations-being lowest for children of U.S.-born Chinese and highest for children of mainland-born Chinese. In addition, we find that poverty among U.S.-born and Taiwan-born Chinese would have been even lower had their rates of divorce and cohabitation had been similar to those for mainland-born and Hong Kong-born Chinese.

T1  - The Strange Case of The Princess and the Frog: Passing and the Elision of Race
AN  - 758122316; 201056945
AB  - This paper examines the negotiations of race in The Princess and the Frog within the dual contexts of its setting and release. Central to these negotiations are Tiana's racial identity and her passing as a frog, as well as the film's attempt to pass as an African American princess narrative. In the process of excavating the film's racial contexts, this paper also addresses its reception by American critics, as well as how Disney, in its hypersensitivity to racial issues and its desire to fulfill so many competing agendas, has paradoxically created an animated feature which generally elides race, even as it redeploys multiple racial stereotypes. This paper concludes by (re)considering the implications of a black Disney princess who spends more time onscreen in green and embraces a hyper-ethos of hard work, as well as how the simulated selves on display renegotiate notions of racial identity in the twenty-first century.

T1  - Measuring the Effects of Black Identity on Legislative Voting Behavior: An Exploratory Study
AN  - 754038389; 201049808
AB  - In this paper, we explore the relationship between legislative voting behavior and perceptions of black identity among black legislators in Louisiana. We find the following: first, on some of the black identity measures black members shared similar identities; however, on other measures there are greater variations; second, black identity and ideology did not influence voting decisions for all legislation and on black interest bills; and finally, self-perception of race and ideology did affect cohesiveness (i.e., in other words, black members were the most cohesive group within the Louisiana Legislature). In the end, it could be very plausible that under certain conditions, black identity may take a back seat to other identities (i.e., party, ideology, and district needs), and this may be precisely the reason we did not see black identity difference influence voting behavior.

T1  - The More the Merrier? The Effects of Type of Cultural Diversity on Exclusionary Immigration Attitudes in Switzerland
AN  - 863244222
AB  - We investigate how different types of cultural diversity influence anti-immigration attitudes across Swiss municipalities. While from a threat theory perspective, a high number of immigrants within a region increases (perceived) threat which fosters negative immigration attitudes, intergroup contact theory contends that culturally diverse societal contexts increase opportunities for contacts with immigrants, which give rise to more positive immigration attitudes. Prior research on ethnic hierarchies and host society acculturation attitudes led us to hypothesize that the presence of valued, "culturally similar" immigrants from wealthier countries increases contact and decreases threat, thereby reducing anti-immigrant prejudice. The presence of devalued, "culturally distant" immigrants from poorer countries should increase threat perceptions and dissuade contact thus heightening prejudice. A multilevel study was conducted using the 2002 European Social Survey (N = 1472 Swiss citizens, N = 185 municipalities). Replicating previous research, contact reduced exclusionary immigration attitudes through reduced threat. On the municipality level, higher proportion of North and West European immigrants increased contact, thus reducing threat. A larger proportion of Muslims was related to an increase in threat, leading to more pronounced exclusionary attitudes, but also to increased contact. Finally, we discuss how the impact of diversity depends on the social construction of immigrant categories, respondents' social position and ideological stances, and the prevailing local ideological climate.

T1  - So far from Miami: Afro-Cuban Encounters with Mexicans in the US Southwest
AN  - 758121871; 201056921
AB  - This study examines the experiences of Afro-Cuban immigrants in non-traditional settlement sites in the Southwest. Drawing on 45 interviews with Afro-Cubans in Austin, Texas and Albuquerque, New Mexico, we explore how our respondents position themselves relative to the local Mexican-origin population. Specifically, we focus on the implications of 'Hispanic' identity in these cities as a category that is heavily tied to Mexican origin, 'brownness,' and the suspicion of illegality. As Afro-Cubans, our respondents face a different racialization process than many non-black Latino immigrants, in that their blackness marks them as outside the bounds of regional constructions of Hispanic identity. Furthermore, the absence of significant numbers of Afro-origin immigrants creates an immediate association with citizenship that accompanies blackness in these locales. Our respondents recognize that they are assigned very different identities than the Mexican immigrants who work alongside them. Moreover, as they articulate identities in a US context, many of our respondents look to Miami Cubans as an example of their anticipated trajectory. Contrasting their perceptions of the success of Miami Cubans with the problems they perceive in the local Mexican-origin community, our respondents further distance themselves from a stigmatized Hispanic identity.

T1  - Homelands and indigenous identities in a multiracial era
AN  - 743066639; 201043303
AB  - Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands - physical places with cultural meaning - are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child's chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Black Canadians and black Americans: racial income inequality in comparative perspective

AB  - Using census data, we compare the economic status of blacks and whites in two neighbouring countries - the USA and Canada - examining the effects of international migration of people of colour upon systems of racial hierarchy. At first impression, the racial income gap is markedly smaller in Canada than in the USA. However, this is largely due to the relative sizes of first-, second- and third-plus-generation immigrants in each country. Once this is taken into account, we find that racial income and wage gaps are quite similar in the two countries, raising the puzzle of why nations with such divergent institutional histories produce similar levels of racial inequality.

T1  - Ethnic migration and memory: disputes over the ethnic origins of Japanese Brazilians in Japan
AN  - 743048710; 201031754
AB  - Research on Japanese Brazilian migration to Japan has followed most ethnic migration studies in assuming a conceptual opposition between an 'official' view held by the Japanese government's immigration policy, which conceives Japanese Brazilians as culturally close to the Japanese, and an 'informal' view held by Japanese Brazilians themselves, which maintains they are closer to Brazilian culture. I argue that, although the tension between the official and informal views is certainly important, it should not be reduced to a contrast between national cultures. This becomes clear when we examine the way Japanese Brazilians living in Japan organize commemorations related to the memory of their Japanese ancestors' past migration to Brazil. In this case, official and informal discourses do conflict, but this tension focuses not so much on the opposition between Japanese and Brazilian culture, but on how different representations of the past affect the current status of Japanese Brazilians in Japan.

T1  - Building Kinship and Community: Relational Processes of Bicultural Identity Among Adult Multiracial Adoptees
AN  - 60347117; 201012071
AB  - To read this article's abstract in both Spanish and Mandarin Chinese, please visit the article's full-text page on Wiley InterScience (http://interscience.wiley.com/journal/famp). This study uses the case of transracially adopted multiracial adults to highlight an alternative family context and thus process of African American enculturation. Interpretive analyses of interviews with 25 adult multiracial adoptees produced 4 patterns in their bicultural identity formation: (1) claiming whiteness culturally but not racially, (2) learning to 'be Black'--peers as agents of enculturation, (3) biological pathways to authentic Black kinship, and (4) bicultural kinship beyond Black and White. Conceptualizing race as an ascribed extended kinship network and using notions of 'groundedness' from bicultural identity literature, the relational aspects of participants' identity development are highlighted. Culturally relevant concepts of bicultural identity are proposed for practice with multiracial adoptees who have multiple cultures of origin and for whom White mainstream culture is transmitted intrafamilially as a first culture.

T1  - A Bridge Across the Bosphorus: Returned Migrants, their Internet and Media Use and Social Capital
AN  - 60340693; 201012019
AB  - Relatively few studies have focused on migrants who returned to the country of their origin or their parents' origin. Still fewer have examined the communication patterns of call center workers who live in one country but conduct all of their business in the language and culture of another country. Drawing on work by Portes and Bourdieu, this study treats the use of traditional media and the Internet and its relation to the bridging and bonding behavior of a group of Turks who returned to Istanbul from the Netherlands and who are now employed by a Dutch call center company. Based on a survey and three focus groups of employee participants, this research finds that more recent and younger returnees primarily bond with family and friends in Holland through use of Dutch media and Internet use, whereas longer term returnees connect more with Turkish media. Some bridging was occurring through interpersonal communication with Turks by the younger and more recent arrivals. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]
