abstract = {In ethnic and racial terms, America is growing rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial threat hypotheses to today's immigrants have generated inconsistent results. This article develops the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative that focuses on how national and local conditions interact to construe immigrants as threatening. Hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants are most likely when communities undergo sudden influxes of immigrants and when salient national rhetoric reinforces the threat. Data from several sources, including twelve geocoded surveys from 1992 to 2009, provide consistent support for this approach. Time-series cross-sectional and panel data allow the analysis to exploit exogenous shifts in salient national issues such as the September 11 attacks, reducing the problem of residential self-selection and other threats to validity. The article also tests the hypothesis using new data on local anti-immigrant policies. By highlighting the interaction of local and national conditions, the politicized places hypothesis can explain both individual attitudes and local political outcomes.},

abstract = {One of the most established approaches to explain attitudes toward immigration is group conflict theory. However, even though the theory was articulated in dynamic terms, previous research has almost exclusively tested it through cross-sectional analyses. The aim of this study is to disentangle the dynamic character of ethnic competition from more permanent determinants of ethnic threat. The findings show that a remarkable variation of concern over immigration, usually attributed to permanent positions of economic vulnerability, disappears when within-person variation is modeled. In line with a dynamic approach of ethnic competition, becoming unemployed or being laid off increases concern over immigration. This effect is independent of social class.},

abstract = {During the last decade, many European countries have faced sizeable immigration inflows accompanied by high prevalence of negative sentiments toward immigrants among majority members of the host societies. We propose that basic human values are one important determinant of such negative attitudes, and we seek to explain variation across countries in the strength of the effects of values. Based on Schwartz’ (1992, 1994) basic human value theory, we hypothesize that universalism values are conducive to positive attitudes toward immigration, while conformity-tradition reinforce anti-immigration sentiments. We furthermore hypothesize that these value effects are moderated by two contextual variables. Both value effects are expected to be weaker in countries with a higher level of cultural embeddedness. Furthermore, negative effects of conformity-tradition values are hypothesized to be cushioned by a lower proportion of immigrants in the country. A multilevel analysis of data from 24 countries from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (2008–2009) supports these hypotheses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the measurement properties of the theoretical constructs exhibit equivalence across countries, thereby justifying statistical comparisons.ZusammenfassungIm letzten Jahrzehnt sind viele europäische Länder von einer beträchtlichen Zuwanderung betroffen gewesen, begleitet von negativen Einstellungen der Majorität gegenüber den Immigranten. Wir schlagen vor, dass Werte eine wichtige Determinante solcher negativen Einstellungen sind, und erklären die Variation in der Stärke der Effekte von Werten in den einzelnen Ländern. Auf der Grundlage der Theorie grundlegender menschlicher Werte von Schwartz (1992, 1994) nehmen wir an, dass Universalismus Werte zu positiver Einstellung gegenüber der Zuwanderung führen werden; im Gegensatz dazu führen Konformität und Tradition zu immigrationsfeindlichen Gefühlen. Wir nehmen ferner an, dass diese Wirkungen von Werten durch zwei Kontext-Variablen moderiert werden. Beide Effekte von Werten sind niedriger in Ländern mit einem höheren Grad von kultureller Einbettung, und weiter, negative Effekte der Werte-Konformität und Tradition werden vermutlich durch einen niedrigen Anteil von Immigranten in einem Land gedämpft. Eine Mehrebenen-Analyse mit Daten von 24 Ländern der vierten Welle des European Social Survey (2008 bis 2009) stützen diese Hypothesen. Darüber hinaus zeigen wir, dass die Messeigenschaften der theoretischen Konstrukte über die Länder hinweg äquivalent sind und deshalb die statistischen Vergleiche rechtfertigen.},

For this purpose data were compiled from four waves of the Eurobarometer surveys for 12 countries that provided detailed and comparable information on attitudes toward foreigners between 1988 and 2000. A series of multilevel hierarchical linear models were estimated to examine change in the effects of individual- and country-level sources of threat on anti-foreigner sentiment. The analysis shows a substantial rise in antiforeigner sentiment between 1988 and 2000 in all 12 countries. The rise in anti-foreigner sentiment was steep in the early period (between 1988 and 1994), then leveled off after that. Although anti-foreigner sentiment tends to be more pronounced in places with a large proportion of foreign populations and where economic conditions are less prosperous, the effects of both factors on anti-foreigner sentiment have not changed over time. The analysis also shows that anti-foreigner sentiment is more pronounced in places with greater support for right-wing extreme parties. The impact of individual-level socioeconomic characteristics such as education has remained stable over the years, but the effect of political ideology has increased. The meaning and significance of the findings are discussed within the context of European societies.},

The analysis is conducted in the context of 17 European societies. The data for the analysis were obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey (ESS). The main findings lead to the conclusion that misperceptions of the size of immigrant population play a more important role than factual reality in shaping public views and attitudes toward immigration. Although perceived size is not totally detached from actual size, the discrepancy between actual and perceived size is found to be a more powerful predictor of opposition to immigration than actual size. The more inflated is the misperception the more pronounced is opposition to immigration. The impact of misperceptions, when measured as a discrepancy or a ratio, on anti-immigrant attitudes is more pronounced in countries with, proportionally, a large foreign-born population. The meaning of the findings and the relevance of misperceptions and cognitive maps in shaping public views are discussed.},

We find that negative attitudes have been increasing on average in Europe as a whole, with anti-Muslim attitudes being more prevalent than anti-immigrant attitudes. However, when split into a Western European set and an Eastern European set, from 2008, there is a divergence between the two halves. Our findings reveal that negative attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants have decreased in Western Europe, whereas they have increased significantly in Eastern Europe. Further analyses find that there are large discrepancies between anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes in different countries. These discrepancies are discussed in detail and related to several relevant factors, such as the differences in size of the Muslim and immigrant populations, variations in the refugee influx and other possible factors and developments.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.},

abstract = {This paper explores competitive threat as an explanation for attitudes towards immigrants. In particular, the paper argues that recent changes in competitive circumstances are more likely to affect prejudice than are their levels. Competitive circumstances are measured by the size of the foreign population, unemployment, and media reports on immigration. These are used to explain levels of prejudice towards immigrants in Finland in the period 1986-2006. This was a time when the foreign population grew rapidly as well as seeing a major recession and rocketing unemployment rates in the early 1990s. The major finding of this paper is that both changes in the rate of growth of the foreign population and change in the unemployment level have an effect on levels of prejudice whereas the size of the foreign population and the level of unemployment do not. There is also evidence to show that media reports on increasing immigration have an adverse effect on attitudes towards immigrants. The data used at the individual level is a pooled data set (N=23,278) of eleven EVA Surveys on Finnish Values and Attitudes. Introduction This paper uses competitive threat theory, as first advanced by Blumer (1958), to explain changing levels of prejudice. Previous research on differences in levels of prejudice across time and space has tended to concentrate on the effect of the absolute levels of societal factors on prejudice (with the exception of Coender & Scheepers, 1998). I shall argue that changes in societal factors are likely to be a more important predictor of prejudice. Prejudice has also been studied from the viewpoint of social identity theory, as developed by Taijfel (e.g. 1982) and others. However, social identity theory, which essentially explains why people have a tendency to view out-groups in a negative light, cannot explain differences in levels of prejudice across time or place. Competitive threat theory, on the other hand, is able to provide us with potential explanatory variables for changing levels of prejudice. 3 The foreign population in Finland has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Whereas the proportion of the population who were foreign citizens was only 0.35% in 1986, it had grown to 2.3% by 2006. Moreover, the proportion of the population who had been born abroad was 3.6% in 2006.

It first elaborates a theoretical argument that explains the effect of events and points to economic conditions, the size of the immigrant population, and personal contact as mediating factors. This argument is evaluated using the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October 12, 2002, occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in the effect of the event and its temporal duration. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event and a second analysis based on the 2004 Madrid bombing confirms the study’s conclusions. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, and survey research are discussed.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Testing propositions from ethnic competition theory, we examine contextual and individual determinants of support for restrictive immigration policies in 26 European Union member states between 2002 and 2013, a period characterized by enduring economic downturn. We hypothesize that natives in vulnerable economic positions, similar to many migrants, are more restrictive toward immigration, because they perceive more economic strain and more ethnic threat. We expect that natives are more restrictive in times of economic decline – when national unemployment rates and debts increase – especially those who hold similar economic positions as many migrants. We enriched European Social Survey data (2002–2013, containing more than 210,000 respondents) with cross-national data on the economic situation. We indeed find that support for immigration restrictiveness is higher among natives in more vulnerable socio-economic positions. They perceive more economic strain, which is directly related to restrictiveness. But economic strain also increases perceptions of ethnic threat, which is strongly related to restrictiveness. We do, however, not find strong empirical evidence that economic decline more strongly affects support for restrictive immigration policies among vulnerable economic groups. Stronger changes in national debts induce more restrictiveness among the full population, but especially among those who perceive more economic strain and more ethnic threat.},

abstract = {The present paper advances the proposition that level of opposition to immigration (i.e., endorsement of closure or exclusion) and its sources are not uniform and vary across immigrant groups. To test this proposition we utilize data from the 2014 European Social Survey for 20 countries and apply the analysis to the following groups: immigrants of same race/ethnic group as a majority population, immigrants of different race/ethnic group, Muslim, Jewish, and Roma immigrants. The analysis reveals that level of opposition to immigration of different ethno-religious groups in Europe is hierarchical, being most extreme toward Muslims and Roma and quite minor toward people of the same ethnic/race groups as well as toward Jews. Further analysis reveals that not only the level of opposition varies across groups but also the sources that drive such opposition. In general, the sources of opposition to immigration can be divided to 2 major categories: universal sources and group-specific sources. The universal sources (sources which increase opposition toward all immigrants regardless of their origin) pertain to threat of competition over socio-economic and symbolic resources. The group-specific sources consist of racism, fear of crime, and inter-group contact. Racism and lack of inter-group contact tend to increase opposition that is exclusive to Muslim and to Roma immigrants. Racism, however, does not increase opposition that is exclusive to immigrants belonging to a race/ethnicity, which is different from most country people. Fear of crime is likely to prompt opposition that is exclusive to immigrants of different race/ethnic group and to Roma but not toward Muslims. The findings underscore the multiple sources underlying emergence of anti-immigrant sentiment, in general, and opposition to specific groups of immigrants, in particular.},

Anti-immigrant sentiment was found to be more pronounced in the 'old immigration countries' than in the 'new immigration countries.'

abstract = {The article examines the role of prejudice toward racial and ethnic minorities in shaping attitudes toward immigrants across 19 European countries. Previous studies established that fear of competition (i.e., competitive threat) is likely to increase negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data from the 2010 European Social Survey, we find that not only competitive threat but also racial prejudice toward non-European/non-White minority population is likely to increase negative attitudes toward all immigrants in Europe. Moreover, racial prejudice does not mediate the effect of competitive threat on anti-immigrant attitudes, but exert an independent additive effect. The impact of racial prejudice on attitudes toward immigrants tends to increase with the relative size of the non-European racial minority population in the country. The influx of immigrants into Europe over the past decades has dramatically changed the ethnic makeup of many European societies. Currently, many European cities that, until recently, had been racially and ethnically homogeneous now include sizeable communities of immigrants of non-European origin (Glikman & Semyonov, 2012; Salt, 2005). The presence of new immigrant communities in Europe not only changed the ethnic fabric of European society, but also became associated with rise of anti-immigrant sentiment. Subsequently, the body of research that focuses on sources of xenophobia and negative attitudes toward immigrants across European societies has grown and became substantial (e.g., for review of this literature, see Ceobanu & Escandell, 2010). The growing body of research on the issue All correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Anastasia Gorodzeisky, Faculty of Social Sciences, Department of Sociology and Anthropology, Tel Aviv University, P.O.

The positive association between size of the immigrant population and anti-immigrant attitudes had been usually explained when cast within the framework of the ‘‘competitive threat’’ theoretical model (e.g., Blalock, 1967; Blumer, 1958; Bobo & Hutchings, 1996). The logic embodied in this model contends that increased presence of immigrants in a community is likely to prompt fears of competition (whether actual or perceived) over social and economic resources. Fear of competition, in turn, engenders negative attitudes toward immigrants (Quillian, 1995; Scheepers, Gijsberts, & Coenders, 2002; Semyonov et al., 2006). Likewise—and consistent with the logic embodied in the competitive threat model—individuals of low socioeconomic position are more likely to express negative attitudes toward immigrants than individuals of high socioeconomic status, owing to a fear of competition derived from their social and economic vulnerability (Espenshade & Hempstead, 1996; Raijman, Semyonov, & Schmidt, 2003). Although most recent research on the topic stresses the impact of a fear of competition on the emergence of negative attitudes toward immigrants, such attitudes can be also driven by racial prejudice. According to Sears (1988) (see also Kinders & Sears, 1981; Sears & Henry, 2003), racial antipathy and negative beliefs regarding out-group populations are often rooted in an abstract system of early-learned moral values and ideals regarding racial and ethnic minorities, regardless of fear of competition. Negative attitudes toward immigrants, then, can reflect a system of beliefs and attitudes toward ethnic and racial out-group populations, a system of beliefs acquired through the socialization process. Following this logic, it is reasonable to expect attitudes toward immigrants to be influenced not only by competitive threat but also by prejudice toward racial and ethnic minorities, especially in the context of the European national states. Indeed, ethnicity and race may play a major role in shaping attitudes toward immigrants in Europe. The findings presented by Gorodzeisky and Semyonov (2009), for example, reveal that attitudes of Europeans toward inclusion of immigrants in society are influenced by the ethnic origin of immigrants. More specifically, Europeans are more willing to endorse exclusion of immigrants of non-European origin than immigrants of European origin. Following these findings, one may expect negative attitudes toward immigrants and immigration to be more pronounced among those holding prejudicial views toward racial and ethnic minorities than among those not holding such views, regardless of any fear of competition. I N T E R N A T I O N A L J O U R N A L O F P U B L I C O P I N I O N R E S E A R C H 2 at T E L A V IV U N IV E R IT Y on Sptem er 6, 2015 http://ijpoordjournals.org/ D ow nladed from Curiously, whereas the overwhelming majority of the comparative studies on attitudes toward immigrants in Europe were cast within the competitive threat theoretical framework, only a few studies examined the impact of racial and ethnic prejudice on attitudes toward immigrants in European countries (for notable example, see Pettigrew & Meertens, 1995; Pettigrew, 1998; Vala, Lopes, & Lima, 2008). These studies focused on the role of prejudice with regard to specific ethnic groups (e.g., West-Indians, Turks, etc.), however, without considering the role of competitive threat. The present research contributes to the comparative study of public views toward immigrants by examining, for the first time, the role played by racial prejudice toward non-European/non-White minority population in affecting attitudes toward all immigrants in Europe net of competitive threat. Specifically, in the analysis that follows, we focus on the impact of racial prejudice on emergence of negative attitudes toward immigrants across European countries while considering competitive threat both at the individual level and the country level in two distinct ways. First, we examine whether prejudice is embedded in threat, hence, whether racial prejudice mostly mediates the effect of competitive threat on attitudes toward immigrants or whether prejudice exerts independent impact on attitudes toward immigrants net of threat. Second, we examine whether structural threat interacts with racial prejudice in affecting attitudes toward immigrants in general. Specifically, we examine whether the impact of prejudice on anti-immigrant sentiment is likely to increase under conditions of intense competitive threat. By so doing, we provide insights into the role played by racial prejudice toward non-European/non-White minority population in shaping attitudes toward immigrants in the context of European societies. Theoretical Framework According to the competitive threat theoretical model, discriminatory attitudes, prejudice, antagonism, and hostility against out-group populations can be seen as a reaction to perceived threat to the economic and social interests of the majority group members (Blalock, 1967; Blumer, 1958; Bobo & Hutchings, 1996). The threat of competition can stem from two major sources: structurallevel contextual characteristics of society (e.g., the size of out-group population residing in the community or economic conditions); and individual-level attributes, especially one’s socioeconomic position and cultural and politicalnational orientation (e.g., measured indicators of social and economic status or vulnerability and of cultural values). The competitive threat theoretical model has received considerable support and affirmation through a large number of studies across a wide range of societies (e.g., for a review of this literature in Europe, see Ceobanu & T H R E A T , P R E J U D I C E , A N D A N T I I M M I G R A N T A T T I T U D E S 3 at T E L A V IV U N IV E R IT Y on Sptem er 6, 2015 http://ijpoordjournals.org/ D ow nladed from Escandel (2010); see also studies by Wilkes, Guppy, & Faris (2008) for Canada; Bobo & Hutching (1996) for the United States). More specifically, previous research has repeatedly demonstrated that discrimination and negative attitudes toward immigrants or racial minorities tend to rise with the relative size of the minority population in the community and where economic conditions are depressed (Pichler, 2010; Quillian, 1995; Scheepers et al., 2002; Semyonov et al., 2006; Schlueter & Scheepers, 2010). Studies also demonstrate that socioeconomically vulnerable individuals (e.g., unemployed, low education, and/or low income) are more likely to feel threatened by competition; hence, they are more likely to express negative attitudes toward members of the out-group population (Scheeppers et al., 2002; Esses, Davidio, Jackson, & Amstrong, 2001 for Europe; Espenshade & Hempstade, 1996 for the United States). Likewise, individuals holding conservative views and ideologies (religiously observant individuals, those with a right-wing political orientation and national ideology, and older people) are more likely to express negative attitudes toward an out-group population because of sense of threat posed by out-group populations to the majority’s national-cultural traditions, values, and ethnic homogeneity (Castles & Miller, 1993; Gorodziesky & Semyonov, 2009; Wimmer, 1997). Studies that introduced prejudice into the competitive threat theoretical model (e.g., Gorodzeisky, 2013; Verberk, Scheepers, & Feeling, 2002) view prejudice},

Earlier studies do in some cases not provide significant empirical support for the existence of important such effects. In this article it is argued that this lack of consistent evidence is mainly due to the cross-national setup of these studies being vulnerable to estimation bias caused by country-specific factors. The present study instead analyzes attitude variation within countries over time. The results provide firm empirical support in favor of macroeconomic variation importantly affecting attitudes to immigration. As an illustration, the estimates indicate that the number of individuals in the average European country in 2012 who were against all immigration from poorer countries outside Europe was 40% higher than it would have been if macroeconomic conditions in that year had been as good as they were in 2006.},

This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members’ negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration – our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.},

Is White tolerance in diverse neighborhoods the result of a positive effect of inter-ethnic contact, or does it arise from White flight, with anti-immigrant Whites exiting diverse areas but remaining within wider geographies as radicalized opponents of immigration? We provide the first attempt we are aware of to track the opinions of in- and out-migrants, as well as stayers, from local areas over an extended period.

The first empirical chapter examines the role of economic insecurity and education on White racial attitudes. The second empirical chapter evaluates the relative importance of individual vs. contextual factors in shaping Whites’ attitudes about race. The third empirical chapter seeks to evaluate the extent to which racial color-blindness (as opposed to other racial attitudes) motivates White opposition to race-targeted programs. Findings in empirical chapters one and two are conditional, while clear evidence is demonstrated that color-blindness does not predict white opposition to race-targeted programs in empirical chapter three.

Furthermore, these positive impressions have encouraged the very same people to display a willingness to continue interactions with China.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The widely renowned theory of group-threat predicts anti-immigrant backlash when immigration societies experience economic downturns. However, despite skyrocketing unemployment and widespread misgivings about immigration’s impact, no discernible wave of anti-immigrant sentiment has emerged in Spain; the ensuing puzzle accentuates in the southernmost region of Andalusia, where jobless rates surged beyond 35%. This study examines why anti-immigrant animosity remained stable at low levels, even receded, amidst such inauspicious conditions. Our explanatory model expects increasingly adverse pressures of perceived group-threat on natives’ sentiment toward immigrants to be compensated by increasingly benign impact of various benevolent predispositions and situational perceptions. To test these assumptions, we compute a repeated logistic regression model, discern coefficient from sample effects and examine time-trends among vulnerable populations; data were collected at the crisis’ onset (2008) and nadir (2013). Defying expectations, neither perceived group-threat nor principled pro-immigration credos (Universalism; pro-diversity) were found to affect the evolution of anti-immigrant sentiment appreciably throughout the economic downturn; however, ideological polarisation and elite-bashing yielded increasingly benign impact. These findings suggest that intergroup tensions were kept latent by a dynamics of political competition that has side-lined immigration as salient social issue: the prevalence of anti-austerity, anti-corruption political rhetoric contributed to pre-empting anti-immigrant sentiment.},

Almost two thirds of the respondents agreed in 2016 that immigrants represented a burden on the state social services, even when the actual immigrant population in these countries was quite small. In addition, East Europeans expressed greater negative sentiments when the issue of immigration was framed as an economic problem—a burden on state social services—than as a cultural problem—having immigrants as neighbors. On the whole, these results point to the importance of contextualizing anti-immigrant attitudes and understanding the effect of external events and the framing of immigration-related survey questions.},

The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.},

Second, I look at whether base levels of and changes in local diversity affect anti-immigration attitudes in the same way. I find that immigration is more salient when defined by ethnic criteria, rather than criteria that combine ethnicity and religion or skills. Anti-immigrant attitudes are more likely to be expressed by natives who live in constituencies where there has been a large change in diversity between 2001 and 2011, but these responses depend on initial diversity levels. For non-whites and skilled ethnic minorities higher residential segregation is associated with more negative attitudes toward immigrants among natives.},

Data obtained from European Social Survey for 21 countries show that exclusionary views directed exclusively at foreigners from ‘poorer countries in Europe’ or at foreigners ‘from richer countries in Europe’ are quite substantial. Multi-level analyses reveal that differential preferences of immigrants from relatively rich and poor European countries indeed interact with the economic conditions of the host societies. Support for the exclusion of European foreigners from ‘poorer countries’ tends to be less pronounced in economically prosperous places while support for exclusion of European foreigners from ‘richer countries’ tends to be less pronounced in economically depressed places.

Gender differences were the main focus of this paper, and we looked at two related issues. First, in our analysis, we sought a more detailed explanation of the particular reasons that foster this negative perception. Secondly, while the majority of studies focused exclusively on perceptions of the native population, we included the perceptions of the non-native populations separately and looked at the differences among three groups, with gender being the primary focus both between and within groups.

In times of economic crisis, the perceived economic threat seems to lead more to discrimination and rejection of immigrants (in line with Group Conflict Theory), while sense of cultural threat is more likely to curb any desire for coexistence with them. Both threats show to be affected by the perceived size of the immigrant population, which increases the feeling of threat in those traditionally favourable to immigration. Other explanatory factors were also corroborated. Increasing contact with immigrants helps to lessen rejection, especially in the case of cultural threat. Effects due to insecurity were less marked and those relating to qualification were contrary to what was hypothesized.},

While most of the previous literature focuses on the explanation of attitudes at the individual level, we focus on the impact on regional characteristics (the local context). Our aim is to explain why people living in different regions differ in terms of their attitudes towards immigration. We isolate the impact of regions from regressions using individual-level data and explain this residual regional heterogeneity in attitudes with aggregate level indicators of regional characteristics. We find that regions with a higher percentage of immigrants born outside the EU and a higher unemployment rate among the immigrant population show a higher probability that natives express negative attitudes to immigration. Regions with a higher unemployment rate among natives however, show less pronounced anti-immigrant attitudes.},

Environmental correlates are tested by estimating the net change in anti-immigrant sentiments experienced during the first dip of the Great Recession, and by connecting this change to (i) country differences in the intensity of GDP contraction and (ii) prior growth in foreign-born shares. Applying two-step multi-level regression to a pool of the 2004 and the 2010 rounds of the European Social Survey, I find evidence consistent with both occupational and environmental sources of competitive threat.},

We test this hypothesis with a new dataset documenting 487 effects of group size on prejudice provided in 55 studies. More than half of these results show no relationship and the remainder shows both positive and negative relationships. Three explanations for this divergence are that there are (1) differences in the measurement of prejudice and immigrant group size across studies; (2) differences in the model through which size is hypothesized to lead to prejudice; and (3) differences in the geographic unit of analysis at which these relationships have been considered. Our analyses support the measurement explanation: results vary across studies because they reflect different measures of group size and prejudice.},

Multilevel analyses of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series, O*NET, and the General Social Survey demonstrate that labor market competition accounts for threat perceptions – threat is lower in occupations with greater expected employment growth. Individual-level characteristics also explain differences across occupations. Perceived group threat is higher in some occupations because job incumbents have less education. Occupational differences in threat perceptions account for all occupational differences in policy attitudes.},

abstract = {Throughout recent decades, social science studies have systematically reported that citizens respond to their macro-social environments. While this is typically true in highly visible and salient policy domains, scholarship remains ambiguous about which macro-environmental factors are at the origins of citizens’ opinions on immigration. We contribute to this debate by theorising three factors that have the potential to move immigration opinions and subsequently testing their empirical relevance. We most notably emphasise the role of immigration itself and ask whether and how increasing immigration levels affect immigration opinions. We then examine to what extent the regional power structure and economic hardship interplay with this relationship. Through the dyadic ratios algorithm, we estimate a unique set of immigration opinion measures across regions in Belgium, France and the UK between 1990 and 2015. When modelling these measures, our findings are threefold. First, citizens are responsive to their environments, and specifically to immigration. Second, citizens become more favourable towards immigrants when immigration levels increase. Third, we find evidence that decentralisation (regional power) conditions this empirical relationship, while there is little to no indication that economic conditions affect immigration opinions, either directly or indirectly.},

abstract = {Scholars often have used the group threat thesis to explain why punitiveness varies across places. This research regularly has found that punitiveness is harsher in places with a larger minority population. Yet researchers only have had a rudimentary grasp of why this is the case. Moreover, most prior research has focused only on the United States, giving us little knowledge of whether the group threat thesis is a viable explanation of cross-national differences in punitiveness. In the current study, we postulate that the relative size of the out-group population affects punitiveness indirectly, via its impact on individual intolerance toward ethnic out-groups. We test this thesis cross-nationally with data from individuals residing in 27 European countries. Our findings are consistent with the argument that greater racial/ethnic diversity at the country level affects individuals’ attitudes toward minority out-groups, which in turn increases their support for severely punishing criminal offenders.},

abstract = {Immigration is of growing significance to the demographic makeup of Western Europe. A long-standing and highly disputed question is whether a larger number of immigrants are associated with more negative attitudes toward immigration or whether the reverse is true. Previous studies yielded contradictory results on various levels of analysis (national, regional, local). These inconsistencies may partly be linked to what is known as the ‘modifiable areal unit problem’ in spatial analysis. This article seeks to address this issue by analyzing the relationship between the percentage foreign-born and perceived group threat in 15 Western European countries on the national as well as on three differing regional levels (N = 70, 207, and 624 regions, respectively), together with survey data from the European Values Study’s fourth wave. I expect threat effects to operate through national communication systems while contact and habituation to immigrants to work on the regional level. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results show a positive correlation between the national proportion of immigrants and perceived threat, while the coefficients are negative on the regional level. More immigration might thus lead to a more negative evaluation of the presence of immigrants in European countries, but apparently not within the regions where most of the newcomers reside. Two recent examples illustrate this seemingly paradoxical relationship. As a methodological result, effect size and statistical significance vary with the delimitation of the regional units of analysis (Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques (NUTS)-1, -2, or -3). This suggests that research in this field should pay more attention to how and why spatial units are defined.},

abstract = {In this study, we set out to explain anti-Muslim attitudes in the Netherlands. Although the presence and immigration of Muslims have become widely discussed, there is little systematic evidence about the determinants underlying anti-Muslim attitudes. Using data from the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands (SOCON) survey (2005, 2006), containing a more detailed measurement of anti-Muslim attitudes, we tested two contradictory mechanisms, derived from ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory. Results from hierarchical structural equation modelling indicate that the relative outgroup size induces both intergroup friendship contact as well as perceptions of ethnic threat. However, only the latter turned out to affect anti-Muslim attitudes directly. Moreover, our findings revealed that contact with colleagues belonging to ethnic minority groups reduces negative attitudes towards Muslims and mediates the effect of individuallevel determinants on anti-Muslim attitudes. The complementary nature of both ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory is illustrated by negative correlation between both mediating mechanisms, as well as the support for a curvilinear relationship between outgroup size and perceived ethnic threat.},

With data from the 1994 General Social Survey and the NPR/Kaiser Foundation/Kennedy School of Government 2004 Immigration Survey, the results from logit regression models indicate that symbolic racism significantly predicts opposition to legal immigration, immigrant access to federal aid, and standard costs for college, citizenship for U.S.-born children, and work permits for undocumented immigrants. The effects are independent of group threat and other factors. Symbolic racism explained more variation in policy opinions toward government assistance, while group threat explained more variation toward immigration levels and citizenship status. Depending on the issue, native-born citizens likely derive their immigration policy opinions from moral ideologies in addition to intergroup competition.},

This paper tests eight different explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes: cultural marginality theory, human capital theory, political affiliation, societal integration, neighborhood safety, contact theory, foreign investment, and economic competition. Analysis is conducted using combined data from the European Social Survey and Eurostat/OECD and individual-, regional-, and national-level predictors. Results indicate that key predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes are regional and national interpersonal trust, education level, foreign direct investment, and political variables.},

In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role the size of the immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of immigrant group size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger immigrant group size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes.},

abstract = {This article sets out to develop a classical theme of empirical research within group threat theory, namely the argument that the size of the minority population threatens the majority population. To be able to clarify the mixed empirical results within this version of group threat theory, the article focuses on the composition of the immigrant population. The article tests both objective sources of cultural threats (linguistic composition and the Muslim population) and economic threats (the proportion of working-class individuals and the unemployed among the immigrant population). The study concludes that, first, the composition of the immigrant population is of utter importance for the size argument to be valid for cultural threats (proportion of Muslim population), whereas for economic threats it does not matter. Second, compositional economic threats matter strongly to the group that genuinely competes for scarce resources – the working class is more xenophobic when the immigrant working class is large. Third, the study brings some clarity with regard to the cultural composition of the immigrant population: it is shown that the relationship between Muslims and European majority populations mirrors the relationship between whites and African-Americans in the US.},
