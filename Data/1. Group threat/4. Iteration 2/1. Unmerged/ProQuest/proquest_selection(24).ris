T1  - Gender/sex diversity beliefs: Scale construction, validation, and links to prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2669413162
AB  - Prejudice against or affirmation of gender/sex minorities is often framed in terms of beliefs about the ontology of gender/sex (i.e., what gender/sex is), or gender/sex diversity beliefs. We constructed the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs Scale (GSDB) to assess ontological beliefs about the nature of gender/sex, including essentialist and social constructionist beliefs, and validated the GSDB across a series of studies. In Study 1 (N = 304), we explored the factor structure of the GSDB and found evidence of associations with prejudice against transgender and/or nonbinary people. In Study 2 (N = 300), we assessed the stability of the factor structure of the GSDB and examined its criterion-related validity, including its relationship to feelings toward multiple gender/sex groups. In Studies 3a (N = 48) and 3b (N = 500), we established test–retest reliability. We conclude that gender/sex diversity beliefs are important for understanding contemporary attitudes about gender/sex, including prejudice against gender/sex minorities, and that the GSDB is a reliable and valid way to measure them.

T1  - An Emerging Reactive Ethnicity Among Latinxs in Tennessee
AN  - 2675713686
AB  - The burgeoning Latinx communities in the U.S. South provide rich case studies for examining the identity formation and group consciousness of children of Latin American immigrants. This paper explores the identities and sense of belonging of 1.5- and second-generation Latinxs who have come of age in Tennessee, a Southern state that has experienced a surge in immigration from Latin America in recent decades. In-depth interviews with Latinxs who have grown up in Tennessee reveal how these individuals contemplate their identities in relation to questions of belonging to (and within) U.S. society. A shift toward developing a reactive ethnicity is evident as Latinxs convey how perceived interpersonal discrimination coupled with recent national and local anti-immigrant policies drive ethnic group solidarity. These factors influence individual life choices and encourage participation in social and political activism. Such reactions will have long-term ramifications for local Southern societies.

T1  - When Global Scripts Do Not Resonate: International Minority Rights and Local Repertoires of Diversity in Southern Turkey
AN  - 2628901799
AB  - Under what conditions do global scripts resonate among ordinary people? Neo-institutional world polity theory has tended to sideline this question by privileging macro-comparative explanations of states’ adoption and social movement activists’ framing of global scripts. Adopting a negative case approach, we draw on concepts from cultural sociology to explain why global scripts fail to resonate among ethno-religious minorities in Antakya, Turkey. Antakya has been exposed intensely to global minority rights and multiculturalism discourses; it has been targeted by various ethnic movement activists, and its diverse population has long experienced stigma and discrimination stemming from Turkey’s model of nationhood. Yet, ordinary people there have seldom utilized global diversity scripts in their everyday struggles for recognition. Drawing on longitudinal qualitative fieldwork between 2004 and 2015, we find that global scripts fail to match people’s cultural schemas of perceiving and reproducing boundaries—their local repertoires of diversity—due to a deep-seated ambivalence toward the category of “minority.” This lack of resonance potentially weakens popular support for substantial policy reforms advancing minority rights and is one among several factors explaining why Turkey’s turn from an exclusionary to an inclusionary model of nationhood has remained largely ceremonial.

T1  - Gender/Nationality Intersections in Attitudes Toward Gun Carry among Israeli Citizens
AN  - 2628049711
AB  - The study explores how nationality and gender effect attitudes on the presence, use, and misuse of guns by security forces and civilians in Israel. Using data from a national survey (n = 721), we find that Israelis, Jews, and Arabs have more positive attitudes toward military firearms than civilian gun carry. The vast majority agree that display of military arms increases the public sense of security. Numbers are much lower regarding civilian carry. Most respondents, Jews and Arabs, would interfere if witnessed public misuse of firearms. An intersectional analysis finds (1) a gender gap, men have higher odds of reporting a firearm in the household than women; (2) Jews have more positive attitudes toward firearms than Arabs; (3) Jewish men have more positive attitudes toward civilian carry than Jewish women. This gender gap does not appear among Arabs; (4) Jews are more favorable of self-protection as a justification to use arms than Arabs.

T1  - ‘In your own head everyone is staring’: the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy
AN  - 2624032272
AB  - This article explores the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Using a narrative inquiry methodology, 25 young people between 18 and 29 years participated in in-depth interviews. Their narratives highlighted growing perceptions of difference and how the negative actions and attitudes of a few people in their past continued to shadow their current lives. Influenced by perceived negative attitudes of others to disability and their own internalisation of these, the young people conceptualise a binary of normalcy and difference, finding themselves liminally positioned, somewhere in between, and mostly seeking to avoid a disability association. In new social situations, the young people reported engaging in disability identity management work, while often resisting having disability as part of their identity. These can be conceptualised as acts of resilience and of resistance in the face of oppressive social forces. There is a powerful counter narrative in a sub group of the participants who were actively engaged with peers with experience of disability. For these young people, the inclusion of disability within social identities became possible. The findings of this study have implications for our understandings of managing identities in young lives, particularly for those in marginal positions.

T1  - İsveç Göçmen Entegrasyon Politikalarının Kapsamlı Analizi
TT  - Comprehensive Analysis of Swedish Immigrant Integration Policies
AN  - 2630307346
AB  - İsveç göç tarihi çok uzun yıllara dayanmasına rağmen İsveç'in göçmenlere yönelik politika düzenlemeleri ülkede çok daha sonra başlamıştır. Bunun temel sebebi ise göçmen profiline dayandırılmaktadır. İsveç göçmen profili başlangıçta Finlandiya'dan gelen göçmenlerinden oluşmaktaydı. Belirtilen göçmen grubu İskandinav toplum yapısı ve kültürünü yansıttığı için İsveç toplumuna uyum gerektirecek göç politikalarına ihtiyaç duyulmadı. İsveç'te ilk tutarlı ve dikkate değer göçmen politikaları 1975 sonrası oluşmuştur. Belirtilen tarihten sonra ise ülkenin ekonomik ve siyasi durumundaki gelişmelere göre İsveç göçmen politikaları açık göçmen politikalarından kısıtlayıcı göçmen politikalarına doğru değişim göstermiştir. Özellikle 2011 yılında tüm dünyanın gündeminde de olan Suriyeli göçmen kabulüne İsveç başlangıçta ılımlı bakmıştır. Ancak 2015 yılında İsveç Hükümeti 'Mülteci Krizi' ilan etmiş ve kısıtlayıcı göçmen entegrasyon politikalarına yönelmiştir. Bu çalışmada MIPEX 2020 indeksine göre alanında 52 ülke arasında ve sekiz göçmen politikası sınıflamasında uyguladığı göçmen entegrasyon politikaları ile ön plana çıkan ve ilk onda yer alan İsveç'in göçmen entegrasyon politikaları incelenmektedir. Çalışmada, İsveç göç süreci sınıflaması kapsamı genişletilerek yeni bir sınıflama oluşturulmaktadır. Çalışmada, Göçmen Entegrasyon Politikası İndeksi (MIPEX) verilerinin, göç ve entegrasyon alan yazını çerçevesinde eleştirel bir değerlendirmesi de yapılmaktadır. Ayrıca Temmuz 2021 yılından sonra yürürlüğe giren İsveç Yabancılar Yasası'nın olumlu olumsuz yönleri de ortaya konulmaktadır.Alternate abstract:Although the Swedish immigration history goes back many years, Sweden's policy arrangements for immigrants started much later in the country. The main reason for this is based on the immigrant profile. The Swedish immigrant profile initially consisted of immigrants from Finland. Since the specified immigrant group reflects the Scandinavian society structure and culture, there was no need for immigration policies that would require adaptation to Swedish society. The first consistent and notable immigration policies in Sweden were formed after 1975. After the specified date, according to the developments in the country's economic and political situation, Swedish immigration policies have changed from open immigration policies to restrictive immigration policies. Especially in 2011, Sweden had a moderate view of the acceptance of Syrian immigrants, which was on the agenda of the whole world. However, in 2015, the Swedish Government declared the 'Refugee Crisis' and turned to restrictive immigration integration policies. In this study, the immigrant integration policies of Sweden, which stands out with the immigrant integration policies implemented in eight immigration policy classifications and among 52 countries according to the MIPEX 2020 index, are examined. In the study, a new classification is created by expanding the scope of the Swedish migration process classification. In the study, a critical evaluation of the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) data is made within the framework of the migration and integration literature. In addition, the positive and negative aspects of the Swedish Aliens Act, which came into force after July 2021, are also revealed.

T1  - The taboo against contact with minorities: A folk‐anthropology approach to prejudices
AN  - 2607918280
AB  - In contrast to the classic theory of contact among groups to combat prejudice against the outgroup (Allport, 1954), we propose the theory of the taboo of contact according to which prejudice against minorities does not arise due to lack of contact, but precisely in order to avoid contact. We summarise a series of themata whereby in the West the majority's fears of losing the purity of their religious, ethnic, or racial identity have been ontologised in four minorities (Jews, gypsies, natives, and black people). The hypothesis is that the greater the proximity to – or danger of mixing with – those vilified minorities, the greater the taboo of contact will be. We conclude that the prejudice against minorities who are victims of current ethnic and racial discrimination is an hysteresis effect of folk‐anthropology themata.

T1  - Integrating Canadian Youth: The State of Intergroup Contact, Belonging, and Support for Immigration
AN  - 2620026518
AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey examining 168 immigrant and non-immigrant youth's perspectives of intergroup relations, support for immigration, and feelings of belonging in Canada. Using Allport's (1954) contact theory and the multiculturalism hypothesis (Berry et al., 2021) as a framework, the data is analyzed in the context of relative levels of intergroup contact, friendship, immigration-related knowledgeability, and perceived diversity. This study finds that, overall, the Canadian youth surveyed were more supportive of immigration than older generations and reported high levels of intergroup positivity and frequent intergroup contact. Moreover, intergroup contact and intergroup friendships were positively associated with feelings of belonging, whereas support for immigration was associated with immigration-related knowledgeability and perceptions of diversity.

T1  - Anticipation of Stigma upon Parenthood Impacts Parenting Aspirations in the LGB Community in Israel
AN  - 2564698389
AB  - IntroductionThis study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.MethodsA total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.ResultsLGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood.Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

T1  - Is Group-Directed Praise Always Welcome? Reactions to Ingroup and Outgroup Praise Depend on Linguistic Abstraction
AN  - 2560602870
AB  - This research examined how recipients reacted to group-directed praise formulated by ingroup or outgroup members and varying in linguistic abstraction. Study 1 (N = 81) showed that ingroup praise was perceived as more sincere when formulated in abstract (vs. concrete) terms, whereas outgroup praise formulated in abstract terms was seen as less sincere than concrete praise. In Study 2 (N = 89), recipients of outgroup praise formulated in abstract versus concrete terms attributed more hidden agenda and prejudice to the speaker, and perceived lower congruency between the speaker’s words and beliefs; the opposite pattern occurred for ingroup praise. Perceptions of congruency and hidden agenda mediated the effects of speaker group membership and linguistic abstraction on recipients’ perception of the praising message. This research points out that linguistic abstraction influences the appraisal of group-directed praise as it works as a cue of speakers’ motives. It also suggests important implications for developing successful communications between groups.

T1  - Ambivalent Effects of Positive Contact Between Women and Men on Collective Actions for Women’s Rights
AN  - 2556958989
AB  - Positive intergroup contact, under some conditions, can undermine the interest of members of both socially disadvantaged and advantaged groups to act for equality. However, little is known about whether similar effects appear in a unique form of intergroup relations, gender relations. In two correlational studies and two experiments, we investigated the relationships among quality of contact, perceived discrimination, fusion with the feminist movement, and willingness to engage in collective action for women’s rights. For women (Study 1a), positive contact with men was associated with less perceived discrimination, less fusion, and less collective action. For men (Study 1b), the relationships were in the opposite direction. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that recalling experiences of gender discrimination nullified the effects of contact for both women and men as compared to a control condition. Thus, when discrimination is not explicitly recognized, positive contact might have sedative effects on women, but mobilizing effects on men.

T1  - Multicultural Education of Autochthons and Migrants in Russia
AN  - 2573029622
AB  - The study aims to analyze modern scientific approaches to multicultural education of autochthons, migrants, and foreign students to assess the real state and prospects of such education development in Russia. The 2019 RPORC (Russian Public Opinion Research Center) survey "Higher education: in Russia or abroad?" was used in the study. A total of 1,600 respondents took part in the study. Based on the Pareto Optimality principle, a model of an integrated multicultural education process has been developed. Survey data analysis has shown that for the majority of Russians (78%) it is not important whether their children/grandchildren will receive higher education abroad. Russian society has a tolerant attitude towards domestic and world educational systems. The practical application of the research results is possible with the improvement of training programs, the exchange of international experience and further research into the problems of multicultural education development.

T1  - Feminist and Anti-Feminist Identification in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century United States
AN  - 2560169354
AB  - Feminism and anti-feminism featured prominently in the 2016 presidential election. Hillary Clinton was the first female major party presidential candidate and self-identified as a feminist speaking openly about the challenges facing women. Clinton faced off against Donald Trump, who was on record making sexist statements and arguing that Clinton’s success was from playing the “woman card”. We ask several questions: who identifies as a feminist today and how is this different from who identified as a feminist in the previous generation? Who identifies as “anti-feminist”? Are anti-feminists simply a mirror reflection of feminists or is it a distinctive social identity? Finally, the study explores the meaning of these labels by looking at what feminists and anti-feminists believe in terms of public policy and attitudes about gender equality. Thus, this study provides insights into the state of modern feminism and antifeminism in contemporary American politics.

T1  - How to Foster Empathy in Anti-discrimination Initiatives? Implication for Social Interventions-A Qualitative Approach
AN  - 2491986183
AB  - L'objectif de cette étude était d'explorer les antécédents de la réponse empathique dans le contexte de la réception des publicités sociales anti-discrimination. Nous avons examiné, par le biais des entretiens de groupe qualitatifs, les antécédents contextuels qui sont susceptibles de faciliter la prise de perspective et le partage émotionnel. 61 personnes ont participé â cette étude, dont 43 femmes et 18 hommes. Les entretiens de groupe semi-dirigés ont duré entre 40 minutes et 2 heures. Les enregistrements ont été transcrits et analysés â l'aide de NVivo. Nous avons effectué un codage mixte des données et nous avons analysé les entretiens selon les principes de l'analyse thématique. Les analyses ont révélé que certains types d'expressions faciales des émotions, deux types de similarité perçue et les éléments mettant en valeur l'humanité commune jouent un röle important dans le déclenchement des réponses empathique dans ce contexte particulier. Bien qu'il soit nécessaire de promouvoir la diversité, nos résultats indiquent que les interventions futures devraient mettre l'accent sur l'humanité commune entre les groupes et la promotion de la diversité devrait étre accompagnée d'un effort équivalent â promouvoir les ressemblances entre les groupes. En outre, les résultats présentés ici peuvent étre utilisés afin de bâtir des interventions plus efficaces et plus appropriées qui cherchent â induire de l'empathie envers les groupes discriminés et marginalisés.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of empathic responding in the context of antidiscrimination public service announcement (PSA) reception. We sought to qualitatively examine which contextual antecedents are likely to play a role in facilitating the perspective taking and emotion sharing processes. Recruitment through the local university's mailing list and an online classified advertising service yielded 61 participants: 18 men and 43 women. Semi-structured focus group interviews lasted from 40 minutes to two hours. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo. We used a mixed approach to coding and analyzed the interviews using the process of thematic analysis. The analyses revealed that certain facial expressions of emotion, two types of perceived similarity and a focus on common humanity play an important role in triggering empathic responses in this type of context. While it is necessary to promote diversity, these findings indicate that future interventions should focus on emphasizing a common humanity between the groups and that the accentuation of differences should also be accompanied by a focus on similarities. The results of the current study can be used to build more appropriate and efficient intervention strategies that aim to foster empathy for discriminated and marginalized groups.

T1  - Supporting Older Homeless Persons' Positive Relocations to Long-Term Care: Service Provider Views
AN  - 2451553432
AB  - Background and Objectives This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

T1  - Retirement Inequalities: The Importance of Ethnic Origins
AN  - 2390150251
AB  - In the late 1960s, Canada reformed its earlier discriminatory immigration policies that prevented entry of individuals from "undesirable" countries and/or nationalities. Despite today's more democratic immigration policies, new arrivals still experience significant barriers in terms of labour market integration, which results in substantial inequalities during retirement. In this study, data from the 2016 Census Public File is used to compare the retirement income of fifteen immigrant ethnic groups to that of British-origin immigrants. The analyses indicate substantial retirement income gaps among immigrants. Immigrants with British ancestry report the highest retirement income, while the main brunt of the retirement income gap is experienced by visible minority and South and East European immigrants, with human capital and immigration patterns accounting for some of these differences. We suggest that the vertical imagery of Canada as suggested by Porter (1965) is now more of a biocultural hierarchy among immigrant seniors.Alternate abstract:Vers la fin des années 1960, le Canada a reformé ses politiques d'immigration discriminatoires qui empechaient l'entrée de personnes provenant de pays ou nationalités «indésirables». Malgré les politiques d'immigration plus démocratiques d'aujourd'hui, les nouveaux arrivants se heurtent encore à des obstacles importants sur le plan de l'intégration au marché du travail, ce qui entraîne d'importantes inégalités à la retraite. Dans cette étude, les données du fichier public du recensement de 2016 sont utilisées pour comparer le revenu de retraite de quinze groupes ethniques d'immigrants à celui des immigrants d'origine britannique. Les immigrants d'ascendance britannique déclarent les revenus de retraite les plus élevés, tandis que les minorités visibles et les immigrants d'Europe du Sud et de l'Est sont les plus touchés par l'écart de revenu de retraite, le capital humain et les modèles d'immigration étant responsables de certaines de ces différences. Nous suggérons que l'imagerie verticale du Canada, telle que suggérée par Porter (1965), est maintenant davantage une hiérarchie bioculturelle parmi les immigrants âgés.

T1  - “We believe, we feel, we act”: Testing the BIAS Map predictions during adolescence
AN  - 2334687032
AB  - The present study examined the relation between adolescents’ beliefs, emotions, and intentional behaviors toward two immigrant groups from the Spanish context: Moroccans and Ecuadorians. For this purpose, we tested the SCM/BIAS Map predictions considering the three‐dimensional perspective of stereotype content, which distinguishes between morality, sociability, and competence. Spanish adolescents (N = 231, Mage = 15.39, SD = 1.09) evaluated either Moroccans (n = 114, 55.3% girls) or Ecuadorians (n = 117, 59% girls) on the SCM/BIAS Map variables. Our results confirmed, for both groups, the validity of the three‐dimensional model of stereotype content and showed that adolescents differentiate between the two subdimensions of warmth and treat them as independent in intergroup evaluations. Furthermore, the mediating role of emotions in the stereotype content‐behavior link was also confirmed but only for the univalent emotions in both groups. Finally, only morality acted as a consistent predictor of adolescents active behavioral intentions. The higher perceived morality of the immigrants increased adolescents’ admiration toward them, which in turn led adolescents to manifest more active facilitation intentions. Likewise, the perceived morality of the immigrants negatively affected adolescents’ contempt toward them, which in turn decreased adolescent's active harm intentions toward Ecuadorians and Moroccans. These findings indicate that the perceived morality of the outgroup is the key aspect in order to simultaneously promote helping behavior and decrease harmful one toward immigrant groups during adolescence.

T1  - The Impact of Interviewer Effects on Skin Color Assessment in a Cross-National Context
AN  - 2431021306
AB  - There is a growing trend in national and international studies to measure respondents’ skin color as a supplement to traditional race classifications. Skin color measurements are often used as an explanatory variable in studies of social and racial inequalities (Bailey, Saperstein, & Penner, 2014; Flores & Telles, 2012; Hutchings, Jefferson, Lewis, & Yadon, 2015; Lerman, McCabe, & Sadin, 2015; Perreira & Telles, 2014; Telles & Paschel, 2014; Telles & Steele, 2012). Given its broad appeal, skin color is now collected in several large-scale surveys, such as the General Social Survey, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the American National Election Studies, and the Latin American Public Opinion Project AmericasBarometer study. There are multiple ways to measure skin color, including reflectance spectrometers, which measure the amount of light reflected on an area of skin. However, for cost and other reasons, many surveys rely on interviewer assessments of respondents’ skin color (Telles & Lim, 1998; Villarreal, 2012). Despite the use of visual aids to calibrate judgments, scholars have expressed doubts regarding the quality of interviewer-ascribed measures of skin color (Hannon & DeFina, 2016; Hill, 2002; Villarreal, 2010, 2012). The extent to which interviewers introduce random and systematic error in skin color analyses is unknown. In this research note, we address these knowledge gaps using the 2010 Latin American Public Opinion Project AmericaBarometers study, a cross-national survey involving 26 countries and over 43,000 respondents. We apply a cross-classified multilevel model to separate interviewer- and area-effects and quantify the magnitude of these effects across countries. Specifically, we address the following research questions:What is the amount of variation in interviewer-ascribed skin color that can be attributed to interviewers and the areas they work in, within and between countries?How much of the between-interviewer variation in respondents’ skin color is explained by characteristics of the interviewer, including their own skin color?What is the magnitude of bias in substantive analyses of the association between Socio-Economic Status (SES) and skin color if interviewer effects are ignored?

T1  - Imagining contact reduces prejudice in preschool children
AN  - 2307985094
AB  - We examined the effectiveness of an imagery‐based strategy designed to reduce prejudice in preschoolers in Italy. Three studies involving different target groups (disabled children, Black children) were conducted within Italian preschools. Children (4–6 years) were asked to imagine and draw meeting an outgroup member (Studies 1 and 2) or to imagine writing a letter to an outgroup member (Study 3). Results revealed that preschoolers in the experimental condition, relative to a control group, reported less intergroup bias in the form of contact intentions and resource allocation as well as greater behavioral inclusiveness; effects were mediated by improved intergroup attitudes. Our findings are important in understanding ways that promote positive intergroup relations in ways that align with the interests of young children.

T1  - Rights, Inequality, and Afro-Descendant Heritage in Brazil
AN  - 2444306674
AB  - For the past thirty years, the Brazilian government has recognized dozens of sites and cultural practices of Afro-descendant groups as national heritage, including the historical maroon site Quilombo dos Palmares. As this site has gained international notoriety, academic research has focused on the value of this historical landmark for commemorating Afro-Brazilian heritage. This article looks to the ambiguous effects of such commemoration on contemporary people living in the area, some of whom are being forcefully evicted from the site in connection with its heritage status. The article addresses the vulnerability experienced by these residents, as it highlights broader issues associated with multicultural and heritage-recognition policies in Brazil. Specifically, I analyze the policies protecting contemporary maroon descendants and sites to reveal why Palmares residents making claims on their land and heritage fall outside of state recognition. I argue that as these policies have become an increasingly powerful mechanism for protecting Afro-Brazilian and minority groups, they have also acquired the capacity to hurt the most vulnerable individuals within these communities. Two very different types of heritage stand to be protected at Palmares: one of the historical maroons and their contemporary kin, and another of the structurally unequal system that inadvertently replicates the oppression it intends to dismantle. In the context of massive inequality that disproportionately affects blacks, maroon descendants, indigenous, and other minority populations in Brazil, it is critical to consider how political strategies for redressing ethnoracial inequality may also end up perpetuating segregation.Alternate abstract:
Ao longo dos últimos trinta anos, o governo brasileiro tem reconhecido como patrimônio cultural dezenas de espaços e práticas culturais de grupos afrodescendentes, entre estes, o espaço histórico do Quilombo dos Palmares. À medida que este local tem adquirido notoriedade histórica internacional, a pesquisa acadêmica tem priorizado a importância do local no que se refere à comemoração do patrimônio cultural afro-brasileiro. Meu trabalho analisa as consequências de tal reconhecimento patrimonial na vida de populações que residem atualmente nesta região, algumas das quais estão sendo expulsas à força do local, devido à declaratória deste como patrimônio cultural. Analiso também as vulnerabilidades experimentadas por tais populações, no contexto da problemática mais ampla das políticas multiculturais de reconhecimento do patrimônio no Brasil. Especificamente, examino as políticas de proteção aos quilombos e indivíduos quilombolas, e analiso como e por que o Estado não reconhece as reclamações de terras e patrimônio feitas pelos residentes de Palmares. Minha tese é que embora tais políticas venham sendo poderosos mecanismos de proteção aos grupos afro-brasileiros e às minorias, têm também adquirido uma capacidade desproporcional para prejudicar os indivíduos mais vulneráveis daquelas comunidades. Assim sendo, a declaração de Palmares oferece proteção a dois patrimônios muito distintos: um é dos quilombos históricos e seus descendentes contemporâneos, e outro, do sistema estruturalmente desigual que tem como consequência inesperada a replicação da mesma opressão que a própria política visava a desmantelar. Dentro do contexto de desigualdade massiva no Brasil, que prejudica desproporcionalmente as populações negras, os quilombolas, os indígenas e outras minorias, é de suma importância considerar como as políticas atuais que visam à reparação da desigualdade etnorracial também levam à perpetuação da segregação.

T1  - Judging scandal: Standards or bias in politics
AN  - 2190352900
AB  - As the number of political scandals rises, we examined the circumstances that might influence how a politician would be judged as a result of a scandal. Specifically, we hypothesized that ingroup bias theory and shifting standards theory would produce different patterns of judgements. In two studies, we found support for the ingroup bias theory, such that participants rated the fictitious politician's public approval and perceived character as higher if the politician was a member of their own political party (i.e. their ingroup) than if the politician was a member of the another political party (i.e. their outgroup). These results may explain, in part, why people may judge politicians involved in scandal more or less harshly depending on whether they are an ingroup member or outgroup member.

T1  - Identity‐centrality, dimensions of uncertainty, and pursuit of subgroup autonomy: The case of Sardinia within Italy
AN  - 2118274308
AB  - Although group‐related uncertainties have been shown to drive subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy, it is unclear whether all group‐related uncertainties motivate subgroup autonomy. We hypothesized that social identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, about one’s subgroup is a key driver of support for subgroup autonomy. We measured Sardinian participants’ (N = 174) relative subgroup (Sardinian) and superordinate group (Italian) identity‐centrality, identity‐uncertainty, and politico‐economic uncertainty to predict support for subgroup autonomy and superordinate group fragmentation. Results showed that subgroup identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, elicited stronger support for subgroup autonomy, especially among highly identified subgroup members. Superordinate group fragmentation was predicted by relatively weaker superordinate identity‐centrality. Results suggest that subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy is driven by the hopes of reducing identity‐uncertainty.

T1  - What Constitutes ‘Discrimination’ in Everyday Talk? Argumentative Lines and the Social Representations of Discrimination
AN  - 2100130068
AB  - Most people agree that discrimination is wrong, but the boundary between ‘discrimination’ and ‘not discrimination’ is often highly contested in everyday practice. We explore the social representations of ‘discrimination’ as an object of study in qualitative interviews and focus groups with both minority (self-identified as BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] and/or gay men) and majority (self-identified as White and/or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Our analysis suggests three repeated and pervasive argumentative lines in social representations of discrimination: (1) that there are two distinct kinds of discrimination (hard vs. soft), (2) that you need to understand the intention of the actor(s), and (3) that a claim of discrimination requires strong evidence. We outline the macro Functions of these resources to argue that each was non-performative: They appeared to be tools to make claims of discrimination, but in practice they were much more effective at making claims of what was not discrimination.

T1  - THE USE OF ZINGARI/NOMADI/ROM IN ITALIAN CRIME DISCOURSE
AN  - 2036728006
AB  - This study examines the use of the metonymies zingari/nomadi/rom [Gypsies/Nomads/Roma] in Italian media discourse, in order to critically reflect on their relation to the perception of Roma. The author analyses the frequency of these terms in general discourse and crime discourse, as well as the way they are used in context. The findings reveal that nomadi and rom are used to directly and indirectly index Roma, and have a significant impact on their ethnicisation and criminalisation. In addition, the episodic framing of crime events, combined with the use of these metonymies, erases the Italian government's responsibility for the conditions of Roma in Italy.

T1  - Who Says What to Whom: Content Versus Source in the Hostile Media Effect
AN  - 2506669614
AB  - Hostile-media-effect research has been built on the assumption that partisans are motivated to adjust their evaluations to accommodate preexisting attitudes that are especially sensitive to content. More recent literature, however, has suggested a rival hypothesis—that perceptions of media bias spring from social identity, keyed to source differences. To test these competing explanations, we designed an experiment around the teaching-alternatives-to-evolution controversy. Partisans from two adversarial groups read an op-ed article with manipulations of content (agreeable, balanced, or disagreeable) and source (in-group, neutral, or out-group). Both content and source influenced hostile media perceptions, but nuanced differences speak to the dynamic ways in which content, source, as well as group-level characteristics impact the processing and evaluation of news content.

T1  - Invisible to the state. Institutional sexual stigma and collective action of LGB individuals in five East European countries: GPIR
AN  - 1910840053
AB  - As demonstrated in past research, institutional sexual stigma negativly affects the well-being of nonheteronormative individuals. In this contribution we investigate the effects that heterosexist legal regulations exert on collective action of LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) people. Building on different theoretical traditions, we propose a model linking institutional sexual stigma (a macrolevel phenomenon) to individual behaviour (a microlevel phenomenon). To verify our assumptions we use data from a cross-cultural study (N = 1,365) conducted in five East European countries (i.e., Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) differing in the extent to which they grant full civil rights to sexual minorities. In line with our hypotheses we find that, by promoting internalized homophobia and subsequently undermining in-group identification, institutional sexual stigma suppresses collective action of LGB individuals. As weak LGB activism impedes social change towards more progressive legislation, a vicious circle is set in motion.

T1  - Multicultural Media Use and Immigrant Settlement: A Comparative Study of Four Communities in Ottawa, Canada
AN  - 1886222538
AB  - Multicultural media serve as important sources of information for immigrant settlement. However, little is known about the role of multicultural media in the process of immigrant settlement. Our aim was to address this gap and to advance understanding of multicultural media use and immigrant settlement through a detailed empirical study involving four ethnocultural and immigrant communities (EICs)--the Chinese, Spanish-speaking Latin American, Somali, and South Asian--in Ottawa, Canada. Using a conceptual framework combining notions of immigrant contexts of reception, and immigrant settlement and information seeking, we present and analyze the findings of a large survey data set (N=1212) comparing types of multicultural print, broadcast, and digital media use by immigration category, length of stay, and yearly household income. Based on our findings, we argue that variations exist in the use of multicultural media both within and across the four participating EICs; while factors such as availability of multicultural media as well as length of stay in Canada and, to some extent, household income play a role, immigration category is less significant. Furthermore, we advance that although EICs do use various types of multicultural media, they tend to favor digital media. These findings contribute to improved understanding of the role of multicultural media use in the everyday lives of EICs and provide directions for future research and for the development of relevant policies and practices to address immigrant information needs and facilitate their settlement process.

T1  - Losing Wallets, Retaining Trust? The Relationship Between Ethnic Heterogeneity and Trusting Coethnic and Non-coethnic Neighbours and Non-neighbours to Return a Lost Wallet
AN  - 1879382767
AB  - The constrict claim that ethnic heterogeneity drives down social trust has been empirically tested across the globe. Meta-analyses suggest that neighbourhood ethnic heterogeneity generally undermines ties within the neighbourhood (such as trust in neighbours), but concurrently has an inconsistent or even positive effect on interethnic ties (such as outgroup trust). While the composition of the living environment thus often seems to matter, when and where remain unclear. We contribute to the literature by: (1) scrutinizing the extent to which ethnic heterogeneity drives down trust in coethnic neighbours, non-coethnic neighbours, unknown neighbours and unknown non-neighbours similarly; (2) comparing effects of heterogeneity aggregated to geographical areas that vary in scale and type of boundary; and (3) assessing whether the impact of heterogeneity of the local area depends on the wider geographic context. We test our hypotheses on the Religion in Dutch Society 2011-2012 dataset, supplemented with uniquely detailed GIS-data of Statistics Netherlands. Our dependent variables are four different so-called wallet-items, which we model through spatial and multilevel regression techniques. We demonstrate that both trust in non-coethnic and coethnic neighbours are lower in heterogeneous environments. Trust in people outside the neighbourhood is not affected by local heterogeneity. Measures of heterogeneity aggregated to relatively large scales, such as, administrative municipalities and egohoods with a 4000 m radius, demonstrate the strongest negative relationships with our trust indicators.

T1  - Not your average bigot: The better-than-average effect and defensive responding to Implicit Association Test feedback
AN  - 1877776639
AB  - A robust body of literature on the better-than-average effect suggests that people believe that they are better than the average others across a variety of domains. In two studies, we examined whether these better-than-average beliefs occur for bias related to stereotyping and prejudice. Moreover, we investigated the hypothesis that better-than-average beliefs will predict defensive responding to feedback indicating personal bias (e.g., preferences for majority groups, societally endorsed stereotypes). Specifically, we examined defensive responses to implicit attitude feedback. Study 1 examined this prediction using archival analysis of two large, online samples of participants completing a Weight-related Implicit Association Test (IAT). Study 2 conceptually replicated Study 1 using nine different, randomly assigned IATs and additional measures of defensiveness. In both studies, people generally believed that they were less biased than others. Moreover, people responded defensively to feedback indicating they were biased. This effect was moderated by better-than-average beliefs such that feedback indicating societally consistent bias was related to defensiveness most (and sometimes only) when people believed they were better than average initially. This work represents the first foray into examining the possible moderating role of social-comparative beliefs in predicting responses to implicit attitude feedback and spurs several important avenues for future research.

T1  - Digital belongings: The intersections of social cohesion, connectivity and digital media
AN  - 1871585235
AB  - The rapid proliferation and ongoing transformation of digital technologies and social media platforms have had a substantial influence on the participatory cultures of young people and their associated social connections. This social/digital nexus raises important questions of social cohesion, with digital technologies at once augmenting social interaction whilst simultaneously creating an uneven landscape of access for participation. To address this interface of the digital and the social, this paper presents a qualitative study of 24 tertiary students from ethnic minority backgrounds living in Auckland, New Zealand, who use social media. Incorporating a pre-screening questionnaire, a one-week social media diary and semi-structured interviews, this study presents the ways in which digital belongings influence participants' practices of friendship and family. The ways that connective media influence, and even constrain interaction alongside the politics of belongings, are theorised to further examine the meanings and experiences behind participants' social media usage and social contact. By integrating these ideas, this paper presents the ways in which young university students use social media and the extent to which digital interaction and networking influence social participation and social cohesion.

T1  - Self-made lawyers? Pathways of socially mobile descendants of migrants from Turkey in Europe
AN  - 1850372671
AB  - This study is based on narratives of successful lawyers in Europe who are descendants of migrants from Turkey. I will discuss the main mechanisms whereby social actors have a significant impact on the professional pathways of these upwardly mobile professionals. The findings provide two insights. The relevance of significant others found in literature on educational mobility of descendants of migrants can be extended to professional pathways. Some respondents became acquainted with the middle-class culture of the majority group through peers and school during their youth. This was instrumental in adjusting to the specific white-collar professional environments of corporate law firms. Others who grew up and attended schools in disadvantaged neighbourhoods had more difficulties adjusting. However, they became accustomed to middle- and upper-class norms and behaviour at university or on the job by observing and learning along the way.

T1  - Perspectives of Aboriginal issues among non-Aboriginal residents of rural Victorian communities
AN  - 2131581341
AB  - Racism, in various forms, remains a dominant feature in Australian society. Aboriginal Australians are commonly targets of racial discrimination. However, understanding racism is difficult given that racial attitudes vary towards particular groups of people, across place and time and are difficult to measure. This paper presents responses of residents across four rural shires in Victoria to questions about attitudes towards Aboriginal people/issues. Responses indicated that attitudes towards Aboriginal people were diverse and that individuals varied in their attitudes on specific items. There were subtle differences between the four sites and association between demographic characteristics and some items in particular sites. This suggests that respondents are inconsistent in their attitudes relating to Aboriginal people/issues and that there are place-based influences on these attitudes. We conclude that the many varied understandings of racism and Aboriginal Australians allow the discourses of exclusion, disempowerment and othering to be maintained.

AB  - The current study examines the Barack Obama presidency through the lens of racialized news framing and symbolic racism. Racial prejudice often manifests as subtle symbolic racism in so-called postracial America by supporting beliefs that racial minorities have gained undeserved advantage and are no longer discriminated against. Even when counter-stereotypic leaders such as President Obama from racial/ethnic minority groups are elected to positions of authority, they are subject to tokenism, heightened visibility, and racialized scrutiny in the media in ways that reinforce cultural stereotypes. The current study uses a between-participants experiment (N = 168) to examine how exposure to positive versus negative news frames of Obama have differential effects on White participants' symbolic racist beliefs. From a priming perspective, exposure to negative frames of President Obama is likely to activate underlying prejudicial feelings that lead to biased evaluations of African Americans as a whole. Using path analysis, the present study builds a causal chain of relationships that reveals that exposure to negative news frames of Obama as compared to positive ones activates readers' anti-Black affect, which in turn increases their symbolic racist beliefs. Implications of the findings for race/ethnic studies, political communication and journalism are discussed.

T1  - Are Residential and Workplace Concentration Correlated for Immigrants? Evidence for Sweden
AN  - 1811906031
AB  - In immigrant-receiving countries, immigrants are often concentrated in residential neighbourhoods with high concentrations of immigrants. In addition, they are concentrated in workplaces with high concentrations of immigrants. Many researchers have assumed that these are two sides of the same coin, so that policy affecting residential segregation could be expected to influence workplace segregation. Using Swedish register data for 2007, we directly assess whether immigrants who live in residential neighbourhoods concentrated with immigrants also work in firms concentrated with immigrants. We find that there is very little correlation between residential and workplace segregation, suggesting that policy could profitably target both types of segregation separately.

T1  - Partisan Participation and Ethnic Autonomy: The Case of the Mapuche Organisation Admapu, in Chile
AN  - 1807486428
AB  - This article examines the formation of Admapu - an organisation representing a broad sector of Mapuche society that resisted the actions of the Chilean dictatorship during the 1980s. In political memory, the period of agrarian reform marks a time of hope and strong participation, but here we show how an autonomy project developed within Admapu conflicted with those making political alliances with the Chilean Left. We examine the internal dynamics within Admapu, and argue that at the end of the decade the organisation divided into factions that cemented a rupture with the political system and brought about the formation of contemporary resistance movements.

T1  - Attitudes toward interracial marriages and the role of interracial contacts in Sweden
AN  - 1802366319
AB  - This paper examines attitudes toward interracial marriages and the relationship between the amount of prior interracial contact and attitudes in Sweden. The analysis is based on an anonymous postal survey conducted in Malmö, Sweden answered by 461 white-European respondents. Several studies in the US address the question of contact and attitudes and find that those who have more interracial contact, especially interracial friendships, have more positive attitudes toward intermarriage. The results show that the majority of the white European respondents can imagine marrying interracially; however, there are clear preferences toward different racial groups. Moreover, as in the US context, respondents who reported interracial friendships, and not general or superficial contacts, are more apt to answer the question about interracial marriage positively.

T1  - Ethnic Identity in Emerging Adults in Sub-Saharan Africa and the USA, and Its Associations with Psychological Well-Being
AN  - 1784567849
AB  - Ethnic identity as a social dimension of identity is argued to be developmentally important for psychological well-being. However, the relationships between these constructs are mainly examined in Western contexts, amongst dominant-non-dominant groups. We investigate ethnic identity across the mainstream group of a prototypical Western society (the USA) and several multi-ethnic sub-Saharan African countries (Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia), as well as how it relates to psychological well-being. A total of 1255 university students (61.8% females, Mage=20.94 years, SD=2.97) completed a questionnaire with ethnic identity and psychological well-being measures. Results indicated that ethnic identity was most salient in two different South African ethnocultural samples and least salient in a mainstream US sample. These results suggest that groups that are more exposed to ethnic strain in multicultural societies tend to have more salient ethnic identities. Furthermore, the underlying structure in the ethnic identity psychological well-being relationship was similar across groups. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Neoliberalism, criminal justice and Latinos: The contours of neoliberal economic thought and policy on criminalization
AN  - 1771962673
AB  - Since the creation of the prison system, the driving forces of criminalization and penalization have been examined by scholars on the right and left with a focus during the last four decades on what some critics characterize as one of the most influential forces shaping the processes of criminalization and imprisonment: neoliberalism. Neoliberalism is a movement that started in the 1970s and contributed to a sharp increase in poverty, inequality, exclusion and imprisonment. While the influence of neoliberalism has become a central issue in the investigation of criminal justice policy, focusing primarily on race effects, the ethnic experience is yet to be addressed in its totality. Therefore, this article details an alternative perspective for analyzing criminal justice issues as they pertain to Latinos and illustrates a new framework for the influence of neoliberal ideology on the incarceration of Latinos.

T1  - Americans' Belief in Linked Fate: Does the Measure Capture the Concept?
AN  - 1951414816
AB  - For decades, scholars have attributed Black Americans' unified political and policy views, despite growing internal class and status differences, to a strong perception of linked fate. In recent years, the concept has been measured in other racial and ethnic groups and with regard to gender, but not applied to social statuses such as class or religion. Without broad comparisons across groups and different statuses, however, one cannot determine the appropriate empirical test or most distinctive correlates of this canonical construct. Using a new national survey, we examine Americans' views of linked fate by race or ethnicity, and also by gender, class, or religion. We find expressions of linked fate to be similar across racial or ethnic groups, robust to experimental manipulation, and as strong for class as for racial or ethnic identity. Intra-individual correlations on linked fate items are very high, while a sense of linked fate is rarely associated with political views or political participation. Expressions of linked fate are not always closely related to feelings of closeness to one's group or perceptions of discrimination against that group. We speculate on the broader meaning of responses to this standard item, and conclude that the enormously fruitful theory of racial linked fate is due for further conceptual development and empirical experimentation.

T1  - Meaning matters. An empirical analysis into public denotations of the label 'strangers' and their relationship with general ethnic prejudice
AN  - 1773531769
AB  - Survey research on ethnic prejudice often relies on statements focusing on generic labels such as 'immigrants', 'strangers', or 'foreigners'. In this paper we argue that there are, however, good reasons to expect certain heterogeneity in the denotations respondents assign to these labels, and that the specific group respondents think of matters with respect to their response. We tested this assumption by using survey data from Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium, N = 1,375) that includes an open-ended question asking respondents which groups they associate with the label 'strangers' (Dutch: 'vreemdelingen'). Content analysis revealed that the ten different meanings people in Flanders give to this label can be organized into four main groups concerning the content of the criterion (nationality, culture, race, no answer/refusal) and two ways concerning how the criterion is used (strangers defined as 'them' versus 'not us'). Regression analyses subsequently showed systematic differences in general ethnic prejudice depending on the meaning of strangers, with people in Flanders who associate strangers with Muslims or people from predominantly Muslim countries reporting the highest level of prejudice. Finally, our data suggests that that the group people in Flanders associate with the label stranger varies according to respondents' socio-demographic background. Not taking into account these different meanings of strangers might lead to an underestimation of the social differences in ethnic prejudice.

T1  - Inclusiveness as Construction of Open Identity: How Social Relationships Affect Attitudes Towards Immigrants in European Societies
AN  - 1764078084
AB  - Studies of individual and group-level sources of prejudice have contributed to today's greater understanding of the emergence of prejudice and discriminatory attitudes towards immigrants. Yet, scholars have claimed that future research should investigate institutional and socio-political macro-level factors affecting individuals' attitudes towards outsiders (Ceobanu and Escandell in Ann Rev Sociol 36:309-328, 2010 ). To contribute to filling this knowledge gap, this article goes across levels of analysis and theories to provide insights about group-level sources influencing attitudes towards immigrants. These sources are taken into account as both institutional and social factors involved in processes of national identity constructions. To this purpose, this work combines Blumer's perspective (Pac Sociol Rev 1:3-7, 1958 ) with both the distinction Weber (Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Tübingen, Mohr, 1922 ) made between open and closed social relationships and some other theoretical contributions that emerged in the field. The findings of a multilevel analysis confirm that, whereby inclusive socio-political factors are involved in the processes of countries' identity constructions, individuals show more positive attitudes towards immigrants. In addition, in inclusive countries, a society's high regard for its own traditions and customs influences individual members to appreciate other cultures and show positive dispositions towards outsiders.

T1  - The Production of Difference and Maintenance of Inequality: The Place of Young Goan Men in a Post-Crisis UK Labour Market
AN  - 1757591701
AB  - This article examines the ways in which young migrant men are constructed as potential employees in a British town where service sector employment, often on a casual or precarious basis, dominates the bottom end of the labour market. Low-wage jobs in many British towns are now constructed as feminized, low waged and demanding personal skills of empathy and servility. In this context, young men, and especially young men of colour, including recent in-migrants, are at a disadvantage, constructed by employers, agencies, co-workers and customers as less eligible workers than 'locals'. We use the experiences of young men from Goa as a lens though which to trace the ways in which expectations and experiences when looking for employment produce a hierarchical division of labour in precarious jobs at the bottom end of the service sector.

T1  - Broadening the mind: Beneficial effects of sojourn experiences and contact with visiting international students on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior
AN  - 1761734788
AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

T1  - Dissimilarity Breeds Contempt: Ethnic Paternalism, Foreigners, and the State in Pas-de-Calais Coalmining, France, 1920s
AN  - 1744618402
AB  - Recently, historians have begun to illuminate further the role that ethnicity played in integrating immigrants into mining societies. Ethnicity, they show, shaped foreign-native relations in complex ways. Migrant culture and local norms both affected the assimilation process. This essay, focusing on France's premiere coalfield of Pas-de-Calais during the 1920s, a period of mass influx of Polish laborers, explores employers' often underappreciated influence over inter-ethnic relations, and it reveals the far-reaching effects of managerial policies. Management's ethnic paternalism influenced, though often unintentionally, relations between Poles and French miners and officials. Employer strategies to manage Poles led natives to see themselves as distinct from and even superior to immigrants. Beyond the workplace, employers used ethnic notions to attract and control Poles, yet in doing so they highlighted the dissimilarities between Poles and Frenchmen. Ultimately, coal companies reinforced foreigners' isolation from local society and roused the suspicions of officials, who strictly policed the Polish community.

T1  - How Academics View Conservative Protestants
AN  - 1767330495; 201609096
AB  - A sizable body of research has demonstrated an anti-conservative Christian perspective among academics. Our research explores academics' negative attitudes toward conservative Protestants. We asked academics to rate Protestant Christian groups, and then explain their ratings, how they define mainline, evangelicals, and fundamentalist Protestants, and articulate the differences between various Protestant groups. Identifying as conservative Protestant and intergroup contact with conservative Protestants best predict less antipathy toward conservative Protestants. Analysis of open-ended questions indicates three groups of academics: Conservative Protestant Critics, Theological Definers, and Low Information. Conservative Protestant Critics envision conservative Protestants as intolerant, unscientific enemies to be openly opposed. Theological Definers are fairly supportive of evangelicals and project an image of objective assessment toward them. Low Information respondents do not have much knowledge of or interest in conservative Protestants. Ultimately, symbolic boundaries and lack of intergroup contact reinforce an academic identity that dismisses conservative Protestants for their perceived traits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Freedom of religion, women's agency and banning the face veil: the role of feminist beliefs in shaping women's opinion
AN  - 2100413765
AB  - Several countries have imposed bans on the wearing of face veils, a controversial option considered in Bill 94 by the province of Quebec in 2010. This paper examines non-Muslim women's support for the acceptability of the niqab in public spaces. Analysing the 2010 Quebec Women's Political Participation Survey, we find that key feminist arguments - that wearing the niqab is a woman's free choice, a matter of freedom of religion and a visible symbol of women's oppression - are important drivers of opinion. Their role in shaping opinion, however, is complex and mirrors divisions among feminist groups in the province. Additional attitudinal drivers include generation, exposure to the practice and openness to immigration. Equally important, our findings suggest that being a member of a racial minority, feelings of cultural insecurity and religiosity are of little consequence for thinking on the issue.

T1  - AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009: A POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF ITS IMPACT ON BLACK AND LATINO UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE UNITED STATES
AN  - 1842827822
AB  - There exists an interesting intersection of political reality in the United States among blacks, Latinos, and whites. This political reality stems from behaviors within the American political economic system which manifest in inequity. This study examines the impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on the Black and Latino unemployment. This study is based on the premise that Blacks and Latinos were negatively affected by the Great Recession and its economic phenomenon. A case study impact analysis approach is used to draw conclusions from the data gathered from government documents obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the United States as a whole and the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, and Los Angeles, California. The authors found that during the Great Recession Black and Latino rates of unemployment were as severe as national unemployment during the early years of the Great Depression, yet the Act was focused on macro-economic issues versus micro-economic employment rates found among Black and Latino communities.

T1  - Translocal assemblages and the circulation of the concept of 'indigenous peoples' in Laos
AN  - 1752995632; 201600158
AB  - Laos has long been recognized as a country with a high level of ethnic diversity. At present, the government of Laos recognizes 49 ethnic groups and over 160 sub-groups. Over the last couple of decades the modern concept of 'indigenous peoples' has been introduced in Laos, albeit unevenly, partially, and in a quite limited way. The three broadly defined groups that have played important roles in variously promoting the concept of indigenous peoples (xon phao pheun meuang) in Laos are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), multilateral banks (the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank), and United Nations organizations. In this article I employ the analytic of translocal assemblages to examine the ways that the concept of indigeneity is circulating in Laos, and drawing on international and local influences. I briefly examine two issues frequently linked to the indigenous politics: communal land titling and bilingual education, and assess the extent to which new indigenous identities are being adopted in Laos. I present an example of how a Hmong group in the USA with links to Laos is constructing translocal assemblages through an indigenous peoples framework in order to resist the government in Laos. Unlike some other countries in Southeast Asia, which have increasingly embraced the concept, the government of Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has not, preferring instead to acknowledge ethnic diversity, but within a framework that recognizes all ethnic groups as equal.

T1  - Local Voting Rights for Non-Nationals: Experience in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium
AN  - 1829550399
AB  - This article explores the impact of local voting rights accorded to non-nationals in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium. The first two countries have some three-decade experience with such voting rights; while in Belgium, the expanded franchise was first exercised in 2006. Drawing on qualitative research carried out in the three countries, the author reviews the rationale for the reforms, the parameters of the franchise and trends in migrants' democratic involvement, including their election to municipal and other representative bodies. In Sweden and the Netherlands, non-nationals' turnout in local elections is generally lower than that for citizens and has tended to decline over time (although there are exceptions, such as the 2006 Dutch local elections in Amsterdam and Rotterdam). Non-nationals' participation in Belgium's two commune elections since the law was changed was low (and dropped slightly between 2006 and 2012). Introducing non-national local voting rights may be making a modest contribution to migrant political integration (including through the election of representatives from a migration background) in the three countries, but other factors, including political parties' recruitment strategies and minority community mobilization, are probably more important. As for lessons that could be applied elsewhere, the author is critical of rules that create obstacles to non-nationals' electoral participation and thus seem to contradict what should be seen as a gesture of inclusion.

T1  - Entitativity and intergroup bias: How belonging to a cohesive group allows people to express their prejudices
AN  - 1700675253; 201525196
AB  - We propose that people treat prejudice as more legitimate when it seems rationalistic -- that is, linked to a group's pursuit of collective interests. Groups that appear to be coherent and unified wholes (entitative groups) are most likely to have such interests. We thus predicted that belonging to an entitative group licenses people to express prejudice against outgroups. Support for this idea came from 3 correlational studies and 5 experiments examining racial, national, and religious prejudice. The first 4 studies found that prejudice and discrimination seemed more socially acceptable to third parties when committed by members of highly entitative groups, because people could more easily explain entitative groups' biases as a defense of collective interests. Moreover, ingroup entitativity only lent legitimacy to outgroup prejudice when an interests-based explanation was plausible -- namely, when the outgroup could possibly threaten the ingroup's interests. The last 4 studies found that people were more willing to express private prejudices when they perceived themselves as belonging to an entitative group. Participants' perceptions of their own race's entitativity were associated with a greater tendency to give explicit voice to their implicit prejudice against other races. Furthermore, experimentally raising participants' perceptions of ingroup entitativity increased explicit expressions of outgroup prejudice, particularly among people most likely to privately harbor such prejudices (i.e., highly identified group members). Together, these findings demonstrate that entitativity can lend a veneer of legitimacy to prejudice and disinhibit its expression. We discuss implications for intergroup relations and shifting national demographics. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Transgender people of color at the center: Conceptualizing a new intersectional model
AN  - 1667948938; 201509476
AB  - Some transgender people in the USA actively experience changes in institutional power linked to transitioning. As such, they serve as informants to the interconnections of institutional inequalities and social identities and positions. Centering the experiences of 'trans' people of color and drawing from feminist standpoint theory, I theorize a multifaceted prism to expand upon existing intersectional models by linking multifaceted social positions to institutional inequalities and challenging dichotomous understandings of categories. I then use this multifaceted prism to critique my own positionality as a researcher and to analyze experiences of trans people of color.

T1  - The presence of the past: Identity continuity and group dynamics
AN  - 1758417025
AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to ingroup continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

T1  - A STUDY OF ASTHMA AS A SOCIO-ECONOMIC HEALTH DISPARITY AMONG MINORITY COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1757046897
AB  - This study examines the correlation between the disproportionate occurrence of asthma and (1) Minorities and persons residing in Low-Income Communities, (2) The Socio-Economic effect on the United States, and (3) The need for the creation of a National Asthma Law. The overriding theory asserts that in communities where low-income and minority individuals reside, there is a disproportionate exposure to environmental health hazards, which has lead to an epidemic increase in the occurrence of asthma among minorities and persons living these communities. Asthma costs the United States $56 billion each year. Therefore, through policy research, conducting quantitative and qualitative studies, as well as, the inclusion of significant seminal data, this study seeks to raise the awareness of this health disparity and amplify the need for the creation of a national asthma law that specifically address this disparate impact.

AN  - 1622296346; 201438372
AB  - The aim of this paper was to examine precipitating events for suicidal ideation and how these experiences relate to disclosure in a diverse sample of college students were examined. Among non-Hispanic White students, relationship/academic problems were most associated with ideation. A romantic break-up increased the odds of getting help. Among racial/ethnic minority students, family/academic problems were most associated with ideation and students who reported multiple events were less likely to get help compared with those not reporting events. Future research should examine the reasons for interpersonal conflict among this high-risk group and their attitudes about helpseeking, and identify cultural norms associated with disclosure.

T1  - Race, Space, and Being Policed: A Qualitative Analysis of Residents' Experiences With Southern Patrols
AN  - 1728661213; 201535681
AB  - Research on race and policing has consistently documented the link between race, space, and policing with racial disparities in perceptions and experiences often explained by nature of policing within low-income, distressed communities of color. This study adds a new dimension to past research by examining the relationship between race, racial composition of place, and residents' experiences with southern police across public and semi-public spaces within a middle-class, low-crime, tourism-driven resort area. Using grounded theory methods, this study combines survey data with indepth group interviews and structured observations to reveal variability in participants' experiences with southern patrols. Specifically, African American participants expressed concern for excessive police distribution, differential enforcement, and social exclusion, offering the least supportive attitudes regarding officer demeanor. These findings highlight the importance of using comprehensive measures to access residents' experiences with police and contribute to the understanding of how various geographic contexts might produce racial disparities, highlighting the salience of race in the policing of ethnically diverse public spaces.

T1  - How Population Structure Shapes Neighborhood Segregation
AN  - 1567048766; 201436176
AB  - This study provides a framework for understanding how population composition conditions the relationship between individuals' choices about group affiliation and aggregate patterns of social separation or integration. The substantive focus is the role of income inequality in racial residential segregation. The author identifies three population parameters -- between-group inequality, within-group inequality, and relative group size -- that determine how income inequality between race groups affects racial segregation. She uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate models of individual-level residential mobility and incorporates these estimates into agent-based models. She then simulates segregation dynamics under alternative assumptions about (1) the relative size of minority groups and (2) the degree of correlation between race and income among individuals. The author finds that income inequality can have offsetting effects at the high and low ends of the income distribution. She demonstrates the empirical relevance of the simulation results using fixed-effects, metro-level regressions applied to 1980-2000 U.S. census data. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Peer Group Rejection in Childhood: Effects of Rejection Ambiguity, Rejection Sensitivity, and Social Acumen
AN  - 1559006392; 201433430
AB  - This study examined the reactions of 6 to 12 year old children (N = 144) to in-group members who accepted or rejected them, and assessed whether their reactions were influenced by their rejection sensitivity (RS) and social acumen (SA). After completing measures of RS and SA, children participated in an intergroup simulation in which they were accepted or unambiguously versus ambiguously rejected by their group. Findings indicated that whereas ambiguously rejected children understood that they had been rejected, they nevertheless retained greater in-group identification and more positive attitudes than the rejected children, although less than the accepted children. However, as with rejected participants, ambiguously rejected children still opted to change groups whereas accepted children did not. SA children liked the in-group less, whereas those with SA liked the in-group more. Discussion focused on children's selection of peer groups, as well as the effects of their rejection from them.

T1  - HIV prevention interventions to reduce sexual risk for African Americans: The influence of community-level stigma and psychological processes
AN  - 1692287895; 201523660
AB  - Interventions to improve public health may benefit from consideration of how environmental contexts can facilitate or hinder their success. We examined the extent to which efficacy of interventions to improve African Americans' condom use practices was moderated by two indicators of structural stigma-Whites' attitudes toward African Americans and residential segregation in the communities where interventions occurred. A previously published meta-analytic database was re-analyzed to examine the interplay of community-level stigma with the psychological processes implied by intervention content in influencing intervention efficacy. All studies were conducted in the United States and included samples that were at least 50% African American. Whites' attitudes were drawn from the American National Election Studies, which collects data from nationally representative samples. Residential segregation was drawn from published reports. Results showed independent effects of Whites' attitudes and residential segregation on condom use effect sizes. Interventions were most successful when Whites' attitudes were more positive or when residential segregation was low. These two structural factors interacted: Interventions improved condom use only when communities had both relatively positive attitudes toward African Americans and lower levels of segregation. The effect of Whites' attitudes was more pronounced at longer follow-up intervals and for younger samples and those samples with more African Americans. Tailoring content to participants' values and needs, which may reduce African Americans' mistrust of intervention providers, buffered against the negative influence of Whites' attitudes on condom use. The structural factors uniquely accounted for variance in condom use effect sizes over and above intervention-level features and community-level education and poverty. Results highlight the interplay of social identity and environment in perpetuating intergroup disparities. Potential mechanisms for these effects are discussed along with public health implications.

AN  - 1767328573; 201605964
AB  - This research uses standard survey items and vignettes from a recent web survey to examine the interaction of race/ethnicity, sex, and attitudes about science -- an elite domain in the US class system. The focus is on the science attitudes of young Asian Americans. Findings from standard survey questions show variation across Asian American ethnic groups on perceptions of science. They also reveal race and sex patterns involving a hierarchy of science attitudes with Asian American males at the top and White females at the bottom. Results from standard survey items and vignettes on similar issues show divergence. Asian American respondents often see more positive attitudes about science for the individual like them in the vignette than for self. Recommendations for policy are provided.

T1  - The Ethnic Russians - Scattered in Geo-cultural and Semantic Spaces of Kyrgyzstan - Minorities, Diasporas or Depleting Historical Resource? Back to the History of the Issue
AN  - 1684423651; 201518425
AB  - The current status of the Russian language in modern Kyrgyzstan is vague and precarious. Historically, Russians and the Russian language have been a backbone of Kyrgyz culture that paved the way for an unprecedented rise in literacy and a socio-economic upswing in this small mountainous country during Communism. However, post-Soviet times have witnessed an advent of revisionist tendencies in rethinking of the Communist past where Russians and their language are implicitly associated with historical injustices towards titular nations. Russian lingua franca as a means of inter-ethnic communication has become a source of controversy and a matter of debates. The Kyrgyz are divided along the lines of those politically-motivated public figures, who seek to exploit the status of the Russian language in their election campaigns. A package of laws providing exclusive use of Kyrgyz language in office and administration has been recently adopted in an attempt to place limits on the Russian language. These developments are widely regarded as discriminative towards not only Russian but also other minority languages in the country. On the other hand, the overwhelming majority of Kyrgyz intellectuals still hold a strong view that Russians and the Russian language deserve better in Kyrgyzstan. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Essentialism, historical construction, and social influence: Representations of Pomakness in majority talk in Western Thrace (Greece)
AN  - 1541997723; 201426792
AB  - Social psychological research has been particularly interested to study essentialism in the construction of social categories and to manifest its potential consequences in intergroup attitudes. Drawing upon this literature, the present study focuses on the argumentative resources employed to construct ethnic categories in a specific rhetorical context: focus group discussions between majority Greek educators about the minority group of Pomaks, historically residing in Western Thrace (Greece). Discussions were framed as an attempt to capture the particularities of minority education and data were analysed by the use of tools and concepts of discursive and rhetorical psychology. Analysis indicates that participants have multiple and complex recourses available to construct Pomakness. Representations of Pomakness as an essential a-historical entity coexist with conceptions of category membership and identification as a result of certain historical conditions and processes of social influence. Essential and de-essential category constructions are approached as rhetorically situated, oriented towards specific rhetorical ends in specific argumentative contexts. They are also considered, however, to be nested within a complex and dynamic intergroup context which reflects the ideological contradictions of the Greek policy towards the minority and which constitutes (but it is also reconstituted by) shifting group definitions and boundaries.

T1  - Whither multiculturalism? Global identities at a cross-roads
AN  - 1559007622; 201432145
AB  - Technological advancement and the quantum leap in global trade had enabled many countries to enter an era of multiculturalism where intergroup contact with members of another ethno-cultural community is the norm rather than the exception. While this phase of economic development is considered progressive by many, it is also regarded as a perilous stage in nation building. Immigration, acculturation, and intergroup tensions will form the nexus of all future contestations with the various social groups negotiating with and/or vying against one another for political rights and status. At the same time, the notion of culture has become increasingly blurred given the multiplicity and interwoven nature of social identity arising from the transnational human movement and the transmission of values. With these considerations in mind, this chapter explores and extrapolates the emerging fabric of multiculturalism across various continents using a historical, socio-political, and psychological lens. Contemporary acculturation and intergroup frameworks are re-visited with the aim to discover new theoretical insights, while keeping in mind the possible trajectory of multiculturalism and how diversity will be managed in the decades to come.

T1  - US Census Classifications and Arab Americans: Contestations and Definitions of Identity Markers
AN  - 1448991638; 201342861
AB  - Arab Americans represent an ethnic group that has been deeply divided over state and Census official classifications of racial, ethnic and ancestry identities. Classified as 'white' by race due to historical court cases, there have been initiatives by Arab American organisations to obtain a sub-race or alternative racial/ethnic checkboxes since the 1980s. The rise of multiculturalism and ethnic pride, combined with influxes of new, more diverse immigrants, has created large segments of Arab Americans who do not feel 'white' and who perceive themselves as persons of colour. The divergent opinions on the race issue and disputes over the meaning and value of 'Arab' and of 'Middle Eastern' led to many contestations of the US federal classifications on race and ethnicity from the mid-1990s. Ongoing negotiations and alliances with the Census Bureau have highlighted the differences between Arab American organisations over self-definitions of community as well as strategies for obtaining state recognition as an ethnic group. Since 1980, the most viable solution has been to create an aggregate ethnic or ancestry group from responses that range from country of origin to broader regional identifiers. The logistical challenges of defining identity markers for Census enumeration have emphasised the diversity and complexity of the communities in question. Through archival legal research, census records, congressional testimonies and interviews with key players, this paper examines how the state's racial definitions have acted to split and unite different elements within the community defined as 'of Arab ancestry'.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup concern for disaster victims of the Japan earthquake
AN  - 1417521865; 201331771
AB  - The study examined the relationships between out-group perception, perceived intergroup conflict, emotions, and concern for out-group victims in the context of the Japanese earthquake of 2011. Six hundred and eighty-six participants in China completed a questionnaire immediately after the earthquake. Results showed that the image of Japan and historical conflicts between the two nations significantly predicted intergroup emotions. A positive image of Japan enhanced Chinese respondents' perceived competence of the Japanese people, which, however, appeared to mitigate concern for the victims. Positive emotions increased participants' concern for Japanese victims. Implications of the research findings are discussed with reference to research on intergroup relations and help following disasters. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Ethnic Dimensions of Suburbanisation in Estonia
AN  - 1364702611; 201323597
AB  - Large-scale suburbanisation is a relatively recent phenomenon in East Central Europe and is responsible for major socio-spatial changes in metropolitan areas. Little is known about the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation, despite the existence of often sizeable Russian minority populations in some member-states of the former Soviet Union. We use individual-level Estonian census data from the year 2000 in order to investigate the ethnic dimensions of suburbanisation. The results show that ethnic minorities have a considerably lower probability of suburbanising compared to the majority population, and minorities are less likely to move to rural municipalities-the main sites of suburban change-in the suburban ring of cities.

T1  - Roma People within the Global Process of Change
AN  - 1665202512
AB  - Although there is temptation to judge the Roma community as having a strong cultural constancy and stability in time, as surviving at the periphery of societies, outside the process of modernization, this paper aims to make an analysis of the factors which caused important changes in the socio-economic and cultural state of this community within the context of globalization. The prejudice that the Roma are a community closed within its traditional culture had and still has adverse effects on the perception which the majority population has about the Roma community and on the support policies for the marginalised segments of the Roma population too. In some ways, the Roma population doesn't have a different pattern from all the other populations, minority or majority. All the populations are engaged in a process of social change and reconstruction, of transition from traditional to modern cultural patterns imposed by a dynamic society undergoing fast modernization. It is true though, that modernization is not only an opportunity through the unavoidable commitment of the communities within the global flow of change, but also a process of new social differentiation. The division of work has generated new pressures of internal differentiation for all populations: some people advanced socially, others remained at the margin of the process. The popular history of the Roma, with the myths of any such history, includes also the intellectuals, prestigious politicians and successful people as main patterns of exiting the 'Gypsyhood'. But in spite of this, the paper underline that the concrete social and economic conditions put, in many cases, the Roma population, as ethnic group in a special social and cultural position different from that of other minorities. These papers bring a theoretical starting point for an empirical survey focusing on the successful Roma population. The survey was an exploratory research done by IQLR at the end of 2012, being centred on the Roma elite: intellectuals, political leaders and businessmen. The research has been identified three successful categories among the Roma people, mentioned above, as well as the factors associated to their success. The survey data are yet to be processed completely. However, they will certainly bring another perception/image on the Roma people, different from the one associated to severe poverty, as shown by the sociological research up to now.

T1  - Analyzing the Determinants of Group Identity Among Alevis in Turkey: A National Survey Study
AN  - 1364702537; 201323576
AB  - This study systematically explores the factors that affect collective identity associations within the Alevi community in Turkey by employing the social identity approach and examining survey data collected through fieldwork. The results show that Kurdish Alevis express lower levels of attachment to their religious identity as compared to Turkish Alevis. The results also indicate that personal experiences of discrimination tend to increase one's prioritization of Alevi identity. Last, no significant differences are observed regarding group identity between Alevis who reside in urban areas and those who live in rural areas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes cooperation through outgroup trust
AN  - 1364700973; 201323148
AB  - The present research aims to investigate whether salience of memberships during imagined contact is necessary for producing generalized positive attitudes toward the outgroup and promoting intergroup cooperation. After a warm-up task that involved reciprocal self-disclosure during the imagined interaction with an outgroup member, we manipulated interpersonal versus intergroup features of imagined contact. Results indicated that participants who imagined a conversation with a Muslim focusing on intergroup differences subsequently reported more positive attitudes and cooperative intentions toward Muslim immigrants compared to either participants who imagined the interaction at the interpersonal level or participants in a control condition. Moreover, these effects were found to be mediated by outgroup trust. These findings attest to the strength of interventions based on imagined intergroup contact and suggest a possible implementation of the technique.

T1  - National Narrative and Social Psychological Influences in Turks' Denial of the Mass Killings of Armenians as Genocide
AN  - 1347783757; 201322436
AB  - This article sheds light on the nature of the Turkish denial of Armenian mass killings. A survey study investigates Turkish students' construals (i.e., attributions of responsibility and perceived severity of harm) of Turkish massacres of Armenians at the beginning of the 20th century. The results demonstrated a high correspondence between participants' individual construals and the Turkish official narrative of the events. Structural equation modeling indicated that in-group glorification, perceived in-group threat, and positive attitudes toward war predicted less acknowledgment of in-group responsibility, which in turn predicted less support for reparations of the harm inflicted on Armenians. The study highlights the influence of government-sponsored national self-images in the production and endorsement of legitimizing narratives of the in-group's violence. The findings call for research that examines the combined influence of psychological and societal mechanisms on people's beliefs about in-group actions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - AN INCONVENIENT BIRTH
AN  - 1347783126; 201318658
AB  - This article reconstructs the history of the nationalist movement among the Dusunic peoples also known as Kadazandusun in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and its demise following the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. It analyses how the 'Kadazan nationalists' elaborated a modern, objectified culture based on cultural traits, symbols and traditions of rural peoples and used print media and local radio to spread it. When the Dusunic peoples were integrated as a minority in Malaysia, the nation builders acquired control of all the main media and excluded their languages and culture. The article then analyses the dynamics of the struggle between the ethnic group and the central government as reflected in cultural production, language development and loss, and in ethnic naming. While these issues reveal competition between various native elites they have nevertheless allowed the growth of a sense of belonging to a Dusunic ethnic group, however named.

T1  - Does Circular Migration Lead to "Guest Worker" Outcomes
AN  - 1315601675; 201307538
AB  - At first at the level of the European Commission, and increasingly also in the European Union's member states, it is being recognized that past labour migration management tools have more or less serious drawbacks in that they produce undesired outcomes and do not sufficiently attain the objectives for which they were designed. The welfare states of north-western Europe are discovering that their desire of the past three decades to restrict labour immigration as much as possible is no longer "in sync" with changing labour market demands, which are growing both for the highly skilled and the unskilled. In order to satisfy the demand for unskilled labour, schemes are being proposed that would allow for circular migration. The European Commission is a forceful promoter of these schemes. Member states such as the Netherlands, which we take as a case in point, are also considering modes by which to allow temporary unskilled labour migration, but seem intent on employing regulatory tools that are not very different from those used in the "guest worker" era, which brought about large-scale settlement. Up to the present time, the resulting ethnic minority groups are the subject of large integration efforts on the part of the receiving states. This begs the question of the extent to which "circular migration" would be different from "guest worker" schemes, in its management and its outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1417524791; 201332089
AB  - We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.

T1  - Evolving Issues of Integration and Inequality Among Middle Class Minorities
AN  - 1266146556; 201300462
AB  - Over the past half century, racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have made significant socioeconomic progress. The expansion and influence of "middle-class minorities" is attributable to absolute and relative gains across a range of socioeconomic outcomes. For instance, despite meaningful differences by national origin, median household income among Asians now exceeds that among Whites (Beeghley, 2008; Kerbo, 2009; Massey, 2007). The percentage of second-generation Latinos (including Mexicans and Central Americans) working in white-collar jobs has not only substantially increased, but in some cases now exceeds that for Whites (Alba & Nee, 2003). And whereas the percentage of Black and White high school graduates is now comparable, the percentage of African Americans who have completed a college degree and/or earned an advanced degree has doubled since 1965 (Hacker, 2003; Landry & Marsh, 2011; Stoll, 2005).

T1  - Collective regret versus collective guilt: Different emotional reactions to historical atrocities
AN  - 1315600217; 201307382
AB  - A distinction between guilt and regret in reactions to in-group atrocities is proposed. Four studies (total N = 1249) support the notion that guilt and regret are distinct emotional reactions. Whereas guilt is a self-focused, aversive emotional reaction following from appraisals of responsibility and associated with the intention to make amends, regret follows from an empathic victim perspective, is less aversive, and is more strongly associated with positive attitudes towards the victim groups and the intention to engage in intergroup contact. These findings suggest that less aversive emotions like regret are more likely to improve intergroup attitudes after a common history of conflict, but the aversive experience of guilt might be more potent in motivating reparations.

T1  - Ethnic Differences in Family Stress Processes Among African-Americans and Black Caribbeans
AN  - 1417527169; 201331911
AB  - Several theories of stress exposure, including the stress process and the family stress model for economically disadvantaged families, suggest that family processes work similarly across race/ethnic groups. Much of this research, however, treats African-Americans as a monolithic group and ignores potential differences in family stress processes within race that may emerge across ethnic groups. This study examines whether family stress processes differ intraracially in African-American and Black Caribbean families. Using data from the National Survey of American Life, a national representative data set of African-American and Black Caribbean families, we assess the extent to which parents' stress appraisals and psychological adjustment are related to their adolescent children's stress appraisals, psychological adjustment, and depressive symptoms. Our study illustrates that stress processes differ by ethnicity and operate through varying pathways in African-American and Black Caribbean families. The implications of intraracial variations in stress processes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Determinants of Local People's Perceptions and Attitudes Toward a Protected Area and Its Management: A Case Study From Popa Mountain Park, Central Myanmar
AN  - 1322723350; 201314003
AB  - The attitudes and perceptions of local people are important for long-term survival of protected areas. Some studies have shown that people's perceptions and attitudes are shaped by knowledge about protected area goals and characteristics and related to socioeconomic factors. In this study, socioeconomic status, knowledge of protected area characteristics, perceptions of benefits and costs of protected areas, and attitudes toward two management programs were examined for people in 208 households from 14 villages around Popa Mountain Park, Central Myanmar. Approximately 50% of respondents had basic knowledge about the park; 38% perceived benefits and 45% perceived losses due to the park. Approximately half held positive attitudes toward buffer zone establishment and replacement of banana plantations. Logistic regression revealed that perceptions of benefits and positive attitudes toward management were correlated with both sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge, while perceptions of losses and negative attitudes toward management were influenced by economic concerns.

T1  - Unlocking the racialized and gendered educational experiences of South Asian females in Hong Kong: the case study of Pakistani girls
AN  - 1283641294; 201303459
AB  - Educating South Asians with different language and cultural backgrounds and integrating them into mainstream society have been a challenge for the educational system of Hong Kong. This study documents the educational experiences of a group of Pakistani girls in the contexts of home, community, and school in Hong Kong. Using ethnographic methods, data collection is based on interviews evoking their life stories. These stories recount how Pakistani girls attempt to negotiate with traditional customs, religion and mainstream stereotypes and to construct racialized and gendered schooling experiences. This study highlights the importance of mainstream engagement in regard to critical learning about cultural and linguistic diversity. It is claimed that minorities have an active role as agents in social transformation and change in achieving racial and gender equality, in this case for the most disadvantaged minority females, within the asymmetrical power relationships between local Chinese and South Asian minorities in Hong Kong.

T1  - Balm for The Soul: Immigrant Religion and Emotional Well-Being
AN  - 1766830186
AB  - Immigrants can face insurmountable odds in their acculturation to the new society, and subsequently suffer from poor emotional/mental health. Using immigrant data from the United States, Australia, and Western Europe, this paper tests the relationship between immigrant religious involvement and emotional well-being. Results demonstrate that regular religious participation is associated with better emotional/mental health outcomes. Conversely, non-religious group involvement (i.e., ethnic associations, leisure groups, work groups) do not have as equally a positive association with emotional well-being. This pattern is consistent across all countries examined in this study, suggesting that religion has a unique relationship with immigrant emotional well-being regardless of national context. Therefore, it is posited that in easing the emotional/mental adjustment of immigrants, religion is not an artifact of context or of a particular religious group, but a generality of immigrant adaptation. Policy implications for the study's findings are discussed. Yet to him, in his troubled state, Christianity brought also the miracle of redemption. Poor thing that he was, his soul was yet a matter of consequence. For him the whole drama of salvation had been enacted: God had come to earth, had suffered as a man to make for all men a place in a life everlasting. Through that sacrifice had been created a community of all those who had faith, a kind of solidarity that would redress all grievances and right all wrongs, if not now, then in the far more important aftermath to life.

T1  - Contagion in the Representational Field of Water Recycling: Informing New Environment Practice Through Social Representation Theory
AN  - 925714374; 201203991
AB  - Water shortages in Australia have highlighted an urgent need for alternative water sources, and technologically, water recycling is argued to offer the most cost-effective, environmentally sustainable solution to these shortages. Yet public support for its implementation is low even in the drought-stricken areas of Australia. Drawing from the theory of social representations, this study addressed community perceptions of water recycling. Three interrelated methodologies were employed in a self-report questionnaire. Individual difference scaling/multidimensional scaling analyses of three word association tasks revealed that the emergent social representation of water recycling was contradictory in affect. Normative responses indicated an awareness of the need to use recycled water whereas the functional responses were associated with a fear of contamination. An analysis of differential use scales further revealed that the perception of contagion was specific to when recycled water had contact with the body. The discursive analysis of respondents' comments expanded on both these findings. The study identified the themata of purity/impurity as underpinning the social understanding of water recycling.

T1  - Risk And Consumer Debt Behaviors In China
AN  - 1438549899; 201340076
AB  - We investigated the risk and debt behaviors of adult consumers in China (N = 347), and explored the relationships among risk perception, risk preference, and consumer debt. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that risk perception, risk seeking, and risk aversion can predict consumer debt. Individuals perceiving high levels of risk were less likely to have positive attitudes toward debt behavior, whereas individuals with high risk-seeking preferences held positive attitudes toward debt behavior. Risk aversion was also found to be an ineffective predictor of debt behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multiculturalism from Above and Below: Analysing a Political Discourse
AN  - 1081865185; 201235399
AB  - Comments on Nasar Meer and Tariq Modood's "How Does Interculturalism Contrast with Multiculturalism?" (same journal issue). I argue in this paper that multiculturalism is a political discourse that is always positioned. Augmenting Meer and Modood's consideration of the merits of multiculturalism vs. interculturalism, I highlight the central role that multiculturalism from above can play, at least in Britain, in facilitating, indeed requiring, intercultural or inter-faith openness and dialogue. It is thus extremely counterproductive, I argue, that politicians tend to use multiculturalism as a euphemism for immigration or extremism. All they achieve by the failure-of-multiculturalism discourse is a growing sense of alienation among religious and ethnic minorities who in any case rely on autonomous internal resources to perpetuate their culture and religion and create 'community'.

AN  - 1081862313; 201237615
AB  - While including or employing members, or more members, of an under-represented group will result in a mathematical balance, it doesn't provide answers to why some socio-edu-economic statistical inequities arise in the first place and doesn't insure quality or inequality of performance, societal trust and esteem, or political victory. There is no doubt that exclusion of minorities, particularly Blacks, was for many centuries based solely on prejudice, but there is also no doubt that some exclusions were based on lack of qualifications. Whatever the case, some haunting questions remain. Whatever happened to the Civil Service, Fair Employment, and Race Relations principle that a person be evaluated on their individual merits, regardless of their group identity? If it was wrong to exclude someone because of their racial, religious, or ethnic group identity, why is it now right to include someone because of that same identity? How can group diversity or proportional representation be created without employing group discrimination, invidious quotas, or group preferences of one sort or another? What evidence exists that sans bigotry all people or countries would have the same motivations, aspirations, talents, and/or achievements? If statistical over-representation is unfair in some jobs and professions, why isn't it unfair when some minorities are over-represented? In what democratic country does proportional representation exist without causing intergroup resentment and bigotry? What should be done about people of mixed heritage, such as golfer Tiger Woods? How are the sciences, literature, arts, or sports advanced by ignoring or belittling individual merit or by setting racial, religious, ethnic, sexual, or national quotas or proportions?

T1  - What does it mean to be human? How salience of the human category affects responses to intergroup harm
AN  - 1018342779; 201212781
AB  - Two studies explore how salience of the human category influences responses to intergroup harm and how different images of humanity modify these effects. In Study 1, British participants (n = 86) contemplated acts of terrorism against their group. When the human category (versus intergroup distinctions) was salient and when the prevailing image of humanity was malevolent (versus benevolent), participants were not only more understanding of terrorism, blamed this less on religious group memberships, but also more strongly endorsed the use of extreme force by countries to defend their boarders, preserve the peace and prevent future attacks. In Study 2, British participants (n = 83) contemplated the torture of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. When the human category was salient and the prevailing image of humanity was malevolent, participants experienced less guilt and justified torture more. We conclude that the effects of human category salience on interpretations of intergroup harm depend on what it means to be human. When human nature is perceived negatively, thinking in terms of the human category can normalise intergroup harm regardless of whether the outgroup or the ingroup is the perpetrator. Implications for re-categorisation approaches to conflict reduction are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 896695763
AB  - A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the US that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the US. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. Here, Peterson seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the US.

T1  - New majorities' abuse of power: Effects of perceived control and social support
AN  - 1910239647
AB  - Two studies examined how new majorities (minorities-turned-majorities) abused power by claiming privileges (in-group favoritism) and disparaging new minorities (out-group hostility). Study 1 found that new majorities low in perceived control showed significantly more in-group favoritism than new majorities high in perceived control and stable majorities. The effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism was mediated by certainty about status stability. Study 2 replicated the effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism. In addition, Study 2 found that new majorities were most likely to engage in out-group hostility when they were low in perceived control and received social support for such discrimination. Our studies suggest that power abuse is most egregious among minorities who rise to majority status without a sense of control in the context where abuse is socially endorsed.

T1  - Cape Verdean Youth Fashion: Identity in Clothing
AN  - 881466666; 201116453
AB  - Through informal and formal interviewing, participant-observation, and textual analysis this article investigates popular, political, and economic meanings assigned to treatments of the body. More specifically, this article examines the ways in which Cape Verdean youth in the Greater Boston area construct individual and social identities via fashion, that is, it underscores fashion and clothing as an important social sphere of identity construction. It highlights a semiotic web and performative practices where local, national, and global identities are negotiated and constructed. To this end, it asks a series of questions about the commitments brought to notice by clothes and fashion. First, how important is fashion in the creation and maintenance of identity? Second, how does the powerful and hegemonic racial coding of clothes and style affect the use of clothing by Cape Verdean youth? Lastly, what do the clothes Cape Verdean youth wear say about who they are or who we think they are? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predicting support for racial transformation policies: Intergroup threat, racial prejudice, sense of group entitlement and strength of identification
AN  - 862596795; 201109539
AB  - Policies and programs designed to challenge the effects of racial discrimination (such as affirmative action) are hotly contested. Factors which have been proposed to explain opposition to these policies include racial prejudice, group threat and self-interest, and perceptions of intergroup justice. We report the results of two random national telephone surveys which tested a theoretically based model of the predictors of policy support in post-apartheid South Africa. The results provided limited support for Blumer's group position model. Compensatory and preferential treatment policies had different underlying predictors: Violated entitlement featured in the models of compensatory policy attitudes, but not preferential treatment policy attitudes, where threat was the strongest predictor. In addition to threat and violated entitlement, policy attitudes among the black sample were related to ingroup identification but those of the white sample were related to prejudice. The effects of these variables were in the opposite directions for the two samples: Policy support was associated with strong ingroup identification and high levels of threat among the black sample (i.e. prospective beneficiaries of the transformation policies), but with low levels of prejudice and threat among the white sample. We conclude by considering the implications that these findings have for social change programs. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The International Protection Regime for Minorities, the Aftermath of the 2008 Financial Crisis and the EU: New Challenges for Non-State Actors
AN  - 896165436; 201120176
AB  - This article examines the reasons why European institutions and in particular the European Commission support a range of public interest groups that exert advocacy on behalf of minority rights. It argues that supported groups are notably those that provide political legitimacy to the European project, those that provide an alternative channel of representation for politically weak minority groups thereby offering them a needed and alternative channel of representation, and those that contribute to a mythology of the European Union by emphasising the concept of human rights and thus providing the European Union (EU) with a distinctive and needed political identity. Among the groups that fulfil these criteria are those who lobby on behalf of migrants and ethnic minorities. The article points out the role of these groups in combating racism and xenophobia and argues that this role has become more important following the financial crisis of 2008 and a related mounting rivalry within EU Member States for resources of the welfare state.

T1  - Exploring the self-directed anger of the stigmatized: The interplay between perceived legitimacy and social identification
AN  - 1018356358; 201212734
AB  - Does social identification protect or harm targets of discrimination? Two studies (N = 52, N = 94) tested the prediction that perceived legitimacy moderates the impact of social identification on negative responses to discrimination. Results confirm that when discrimination is perceived as illegitimate, identification is negatively related to self-directed anger (buffering effect) because identification provides a feeling of in-group support. However, when discrimination is perceived as legitimate, identification is positively related to self-directed anger (exacerbating effect) because the internalized social identity is perceived as legitimate target for the negative treatment. Legitimacy is measured and manipulated among different low-status groups. The legitimization and internalization of discrimination driven by self-directed anger are discussed.

T1  - Does Gender Matter? Men and Women on Controversial Social Issues
AN  - 835113505; 201102197
AB  - In this article we explore gender differences in opinion regarding controversial social issues. The issues we selected are: attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, Muslims, Affirmative Action, abortion, and gays and lesbians. This selection is based on the importance of these issues in public debate and electoral politics. A number of these issues, mainly those related to opinions toward religious and racial groups, reflect the development of the American society and draw lines of possible disagreements and social cleavages. Our purpose is to draw attention to an important factor in determining public opinion toward these issues. We aim to explore issues where gender makes a clear difference, where it does not only hold an important role as other factors such as race and political affiliation, and where considerations of gender need to be combined with other personal attributes in order to understand their real impact. These highlights are intended to shed light on the role of gender in social issues as well as understanding these issues from a perspective that includes gender as a dimension in opinion making.

T1  - Media framing of proposed nuclear reactors: An analysis of print media
AN  - 764417453; 201064623
AB  - Nuclear energy has received substantial recent attention, marketed as a 'green' solution to global climate change (GCC) with calls for new reactors. However, considerable debate exists about whether it represents a viable solution to GCC. Given the complexity and urgency of the issue, a full and balanced debate is desirable. Since media play an important role in shaping public perception, we examined print media coverage of proposed reactors in Georgia-one site in the southeastern United States, which has been the focus of such proposals. We analysed the content of editorials and news articles from two local newspapers-the Augusta Chronicle and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The former exclusively published pro-nuclear opinion pieces whereas the latter published a mix of pro- and anti-nuclear opinions. The majority of news articles in both newspapers generally presented balanced arguments. Pro- and anti-nuclear arguments most often reflected economic and environmental benefits and risks, whereas informational text primarily detailed regulatory processes and financing. Findings suggested that informational text was not necessarily 'neutral', sometimes masking covert pro- and anti-nuclear content. Implications for how findings might shape public opinion and strategies for shaping media and extending public deliberation are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

In the papers he wrote at the beginning of the 1930s dealing with the questions of language and writing, the author made singular use of the concept 'Han' to talk about the language/writing of the 'Han' (Hanzi, Hanyu) as a racial or ethnic group (Hanzu). Qu elaborated a discourse which articulated and mobilized, sometimes in a contradictory manner, the 'Han' category both as a 'race' and as a social class. Going beyond the race/class dialectic, I will try to show that these texts question the territorial, cultural and ethnic boundaries of 'China' and its homogeneity. Following this argument, this paper demonstrates how Qu's attempt to define 'Chinese language(s)' helps us to elucidate the complex articulation between China as a discursive and spatial category, the 'Han' category, and the other nationalities in the Chinese space. By questioning the homogeneity of the linguistic identity of China, using the word zhongguohua, Qu Qiubai unveiled an unstable and fragile imaginary relative to China and its so-called majority ethnic group, the Han.

T1  - Ethnic and Transnational Dimensions of Recent Protestant Conversion among the Hmong in Northern Vietnam
AN  - 764425915; 201064785
AB  - The author argues that ethnic and transnational dimensions are crucial to an understanding of the conversion of the Hmong to Protestantism in Northern Vietnam. Although a number of scholars have proposed that the study of religion be incorporated into the study of transnationalism, the "transnationalization" of religion is still rather understudied, and there have been few scholarly efforts to analyze the transnational aspects of the conversions to world religions of marginalized ethnic minority groups in countries with high levels of emigration. The author examines the transnationalization of religion via the case of the Hmong conversion to show that the impact of missionization is twofold, as not only does the habitus of the Hmong in Vietnam change through massive conversion but so also does the subjectivity of the Hmong missionaries. She proposes to conceptualize the evangelical mission of the Hmong diasporas in Vietnam in particular and in Asia in general as a form of "remittance of faith and modernity".

T1  - Evolution of Ethnic Enclaves in the Toronto Metropolitan Area, 2001--2006
AN  - 754041850; 201053382
AB  - How do ethnic enclaves grow and change over time? This question is addressed by a longitudinal analysis of the geography of ethnic enclaves in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area over the period 2001--2006. The analysis shows that the enclaves in the Toronto area are continually realigning, their centres of gravity shifting and their contours changing. Usually, in an enclave, an axis or band of high-ethnic-density territories is formed, surrounded by zones of lower ethnic concentrations. Enclaves of groups with high levels of immigration from South Asia and China have been expanding, whilst those of earlier waves of immigrants--Jews, Portuguese and Italians--show tendencies towards consolidation and contraction. The emergence of ethnic institutions and services keeps enclaves thriving. Today, enclaves are largely in suburban areas where homeownership rates are high and new housing has been built. In the Toronto area enclaves, particular ethnic groups are demographically dominant without being a majority. Other ethnic groups have a sizable presence in these enclaves.

T1  - STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF RACE AND ETHNIC RELATIONS POST OBAMA'S ELECTION: A PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
AN  - 762232135
AB  - Seventy-three students, who attend a predominantly white, Northeastern college, participated in this 2009-2010 pilot study that drew from Bonilla-Silva's previous research. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, we examined students' exposure to diversity and their views on affirmative action, interracial marriage, intergroup contact, minorities' cultural values and life chances, racial discrimination, and their perceptions of race issues in the U.S. since Obama's election. Although some students employed Bonilla-Silva's four frames of color-blind racism, students also acknowledged structural factors of racism and exhibited a deeper understanding of race and ethnic relations than was previously suggested in Bonilla-Silva's work. We explore varying reasons for this as well as analyze students' identification with the value of post-racialism as symbolized by Obama's presidency. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Willing to Work: Agency and Vulnerability in an Undocumented Immigrant Network
AN  - 848560986
AB  - Restriction-oriented immigration policies and polarizing political debates have intensified the vulnerability of undocumented people in the United States, promoting their "willingness" to do low-wage, low-status work. In this article, I draw on ethnographic research with undocumented immigrants in Chicago to examine the everyday strategies that undocumented workers develop to mediate constraints and enhance their well-being. In particular, I explore how a cohort of undocumented Mexican immigrants cultivates a social identity as "hard workers" to promote their labor and bolster dignity and self-esteem. Much of the existing literature on unauthorized labor migration has focused on the structural conditions that encumber immigrants and constrain their opportunities. By shifting the focus to workers' agency, I seek to complement these analyses and show how undocumented immigrants actively navigate the terrain of work and society in the United States.

T1  - Prejudice at the Nexus of Race and Gender: An Outgroup Male Target Hypothesis
AN  - 743065728; 201043324
AB  - Adopting an evolutionary approach to the psychology of race bias, we posit that intergroup conflict perpetrated by male aggressors throughout human evolutionary history has shaped the psychology of modern forms of intergroup bias and that this psychology reflects the unique adaptive problems that differ between men and women in coping with male aggressors from groups other than one's own. Here we report results across 4 studies consistent with this perspective, showing that race bias is moderated by gender differences in traits relevant to threat responses that differ in their adaptive utility between the sexes-namely, aggression and dominance motives for men and fear of sexual coercion for women. These results are consistent with the notion that the psychology of intergroup bias is generated by different psychological systems for men and women, and the results underscore the importance of considering the gender of the outgroup target as well as the gender of the agent in psychological studies on prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Diversity in the person, diversity in the group: Challenges of identity complexity for social perception and social interaction
AN  - 60396957; 201017393
AB  - Social psychological research is increasingly coming to grips with the complexity of social identity within the individual, both from the perspective of perceivers trying to form impressions and make judgments about multiply categorizable targets, as well as from the perspective of actors using their different self-aspects as a framework for guiding their interactions with the social world. I review several contributions to the effort to better understand these issues and then explore some of their possible implications for understanding the nature and consequences of diversity within the group.
