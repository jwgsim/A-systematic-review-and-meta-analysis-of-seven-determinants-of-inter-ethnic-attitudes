T1  - Value systems as motivational forces for the suppression of ageism towards older people amongst young adults: an analysis across countries
AN  - 2635431839
AB  - What explains ageism towards older people? Several answers exist in the literature, but it is still unclear whether the ageism people express has been altered by motivational forces (i.e. factors which carry or enact motivation, leading to action or thought) or whether an original, primal ageism can be expressed directly. Investigating populations of young adults (45 and younger), this article suggests that value systems are sources of internal and external motivational forces which work to either suppress or to justify both subtle and blatant forms of ageism. It was hypothesised that, at the individual level, values precede any threat perception and negative stereotypical beliefs associated with older people, leading to forms of ageism which match the motivational goals of a person's values. It was further expected that, at the cultural level, values represent the climate in which people express ageist beliefs. It was found that self-transcendence values can bypass the negative effects of threat perception and negative stereotypes, resulting in less-negative forms of ageism. A sample comprising a clear majority of hierarchical, non-Western cultures showed that self-enhancement values also contributed motivational strength for the suppression of blatant ageism. A practical implication of these findings is the possibility of further developing existing strategies of combating ageism by working to effect appropriate long-term changes in the values of young adults.

T1  - Formation and Benefits of Intercultural Friendships: The Role of Communication
AN  - 2686235427
AB  - This qualitative study provides novel insights into exploring factors that influence intercultural friendship formation and friendship benefits, focusing on the role of communication. A research gap has been addressed by focusing on Muslim women who wear the hijab and exploring what factors had influenced their friendship formation with people from culturally different backgrounds and what impact the friendship had on the self. Findings suggested that cultural, linguistic and religious similarity was deemed as not important for friendship formation. Instead, similar values, self-disclosure and respectful communication assisted intercultural friendship formation. Friendship barriers included cultural misconceptions and behavioral uncertainty. Clear evidence emerged that these intercultural friendships led to positive attitudinal changes of the individuals within and beyond the friendship. This included increased cultural understanding, acceptance and selfreflection. It was revealed that cultural misconceptions (and levels of Islamophobia) were eliminated and ethnocentrism was reduced.

T1  - The role of value perceptions in intergroup conflict and cooperation
AN  - 2567817835
AB  - Democratic politics, at its core, consists of competition between group interests. What brings groups into social and political conflict with each other, and what may instead drive them to cooperate or become allies? This paper presents evidence from a nationally representative non-probability survey, finding that groups’ perceived values—that is, their general beliefs about what is right or desirable—relate to a broad array of intergroup relationships. Individuals who perceive racial, religious, and partisan outgroup members as supporting self-transcendence values (those related to care, cooperation and other prosocial behaviors) express more positive affect, solidarity, willingness to engage in political action, and tolerance with respect to those groups. The magnitude of this association exceeds those of other perceived basic and political values, even when it comes to explicitly political attitudes or target groups. Thus, fundamental, ostensibly nonpolitical beliefs about outgroups’ prosocial intentions may underlie intergroup conflict and cooperation.

T1  - Giving the right direction: Predictive action cues during an attentional task reduce prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2573355194
AB  - The current work aims to investigate if social cueing during an attentional task is likely to influence prejudice. In three studies we adopted a Posner-like task whereby participants observed an outgroup (vs ingroup) member performing a reach-to-grasp movement. The individual’s action, oriented rightward or leftward toward an object, preceded a peripheral target stimulus requiring a simple categorization response. The action direction could be congruent or incongruent with target location. Unbeknownst to the participants, the action direction predicted the target location with different validities. We measured the identification with the ingroup (i.e., Italians) and the prejudice toward the outgroup (i.e., Iraqi). Results showed that, for highly identified participants, explicit prejudice toward Arabs was lower after predictive-congruent social cues provided by an outgroup member than after predictive-incongruent cues. Thus, these findings suggest that positive experience with an outgroup member, even when subtle, might be effective in changing attitudes toward the entire social category.

T1  - The implications of threat for blind and constructive patriots and immigration attitudes
AN  - 2559690821
AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti‐immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti‐immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti‐immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti‐immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti‐immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti‐immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States.

T1  - Whose lives mattered? How White and Black Americans felt about Black Lives Matter in 2016
AN  - 2533412241
AB  - White Americans, on average, do not support Black Lives Matter, while Black Americans generally express strong support. The lack of support among white Americans is striking, and we argue that it matters why this racial gap exists. Using a nationally representative survey collected during the crest of the first wave of widespread attention to the movement, we explore four potential explanations for interracial differences in feelings toward Black Lives Matter. These explanations reflect competing claims made by advocates and opponents of the movement and have distinct implications for understanding the meaning of these racial differences. Two explanations focus on attitudes toward the police, and two focus on racial prejudice. The results suggest that interracial differences in contact with the police mattered to views of the movement, though in opposite ways for white and Black Americans. Support for the movement among Black Americans was not motivated by an animosity toward the police. Ultimately, the lack of white support for Black Lives Matter was best explained by anti-Black animus and racial resentment, reflecting a concern about the threat this contemporary civil rights movement presents to the racial status quo.

T1  - From perceived polarization of immigration attitudes to collective action
AN  - 2516238792
AB  - In the context where immigration divides the political space of Western societies, perceived social polarization as an explanation of collective action is surprisingly understudied in contemporary social psychology. We hypothesize that the more people perceive polarization, the more they will engage in collective action in line with their attitudes. Moreover, this effect should be explained by two interrelated factors: identification and perceived efficacy. Perceived polarization should shape how important immigration attitudes are for individuals' self-definition and thereby believing oneself capable of making a change, which in turn triggers collective action. To test our predictions, we conducted three studies (Studies 1 and 2 were correlational and Study 3 experimental) among mobilized and non-mobilized samples in two countries (i.e., Belgium and Switzerland). Results partially support our predictions that perceived social polarization on immigration issues relates to engaging in collective action. Indirect effect analyses revealed the predominant role of identity dynamics in the social psychological processes linked to perceiving polarization. These results provide potential explanations to the strong mobilization that emerged since 2015 following the so-called migrant crisis. Implications of our findings for collective action literature are discussed.

T1  - Less human, more to blame: Animalizing poor people increases blame and decreases support for wealth redistribution: GPIR
AN  - 2407985159
AB  - Increasing economic inequality adversely affects groups with low socioeconomic status (low-SES). However, many people are opposed to wealth redistribution policies. In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants’ SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.

T1  - Unemployment and social stigma: Naming, blaming and shaming of educated youth in rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
TT  - Unemployment and social stigma
AN  - 2416093008
AB  - PurposeThis article aims to highlight the stigmatization attached to the unemployment of educated youth in rural regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Design/methodology/approachThe study explicates the subjective experiences of the youth as being unemployed and societal attitudes toward them through an in-depth qualitative approach. A total of 30 unemployed male individuals were interviewed through an interview guide.FindingsThe study reveals that unemployed individuals are stigmatized and discriminately treated. They experience the difference in social support from their family and friends during unemployment, which is a discouraging aspect. This finding is in contrast to the existing literature on the subject in which family and friends are described as a major source of social support. As the study is conducted in the rural context, it is observed that local factors coupled with the joint family system have intensified negative attitudes toward the unemployed youth. Subsequently, the negative societal treatment serves as a factor for psychological challenges in their lives.Originality/valueThis article serves the need of exploring the experiences of unemployed individuals precisely in the Pakistani context.

T1  - Stigma towards psychosis: Cross‐cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination in White British and South Asians
AN  - 2381929623
AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non‐Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16–20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross‐sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds.

T1  - In Two Minds: Similarity, Threat, and Prejudice Contribute to Worse Mindreading of Outgroups Compared With an Ingroup
AN  - 2327883887
AB  - We examined Turkish participants’ mindreading accuracy toward ingroup versus outgroup targets. Three hundred and fifty-four Turkish participants were randomly assigned to one of three target groups: Turkish, Syrian, or Norwegian. The mindreading accuracy for these targets was measured along with the perceived cultural similarity of the target to the ingroup, as well as prejudice and threat perception. Participants evidenced higher mindreading accuracy toward Turkish targets compared with Syrian and Norwegian targets. Mindreading accuracy for the Syrian and Norwegian targets did not differ, but lower perceived similarity to the Turkish ingroup significantly predicted lower mentalizing for Syrian and Norwegians. In the Syrian target group, lower perceived similarity interacted with lower education and higher prejudice, resulting in a further reduction in mindreading. For Norwegian targets, lower similarity impaired mindreading through an interaction with higher threat perception. Results indicate that even when mentalizing capacity is mature, intergroup factors are linked with the deployment of mindreading.

T1  - Voting Can Be Hard, Information Helps
AN  - 2319179267
AB  - Many U.S. elections provide voters with precious little information about candidates on the ballot. In local contests, party labels are often absent. In primary elections, party labels are not useful. Indeed, much of the time, voters have only the name of the candidate to go by. In these contexts, how do voters make decisions? Using several experiments, we find that voters use candidates’ race, ethnicity, and gender as cues for whom to support—penalizing candidates of color and benefiting women. But we also demonstrate that providing even a small amount of information to voters—such as candidate occupation—virtually erases the effects of candidate demographics on voter behavior, even among voters with high levels of racial and gender prejudice.

T1  - 'We can't just put any belly-dancer into the program': cultural activism as boundary work in the city of Bratislava
AN  - 2261199466
AB  - Festivals are an increasingly more popular form of contemporary cultural activism. Countering prejudice through arts, using culture as a tool of communication, and creating an opportunity for marginalised groups to participate in public life, they represent a specific and novel means of civic activism. In this paper, I introduce a case study of the multicultural festival [fjúzn], aiming to enhance the public visibility of 'new minorities' and bring attention to the ethnic and cultural diversity in the city of Bratislava, Slovakia. Building on a festival ethnography and drawing on the perspective of boundary work [Jaworsky, B. Nadya. 2016. The Boundaries of Belonging: Online Work of Immigration-related Social Movement Organizations. Palgrave Macmillan], I show how the festival organisers work towards crossing and blurring symbolic boundaries in society. I offer a close interpretive reading of their attempts at capturing public places and cultivating a diverse language-scape, while showing how they simultaneously maintain, solidify, or even inscribe new boundaries. I conclude by raising critical points about the potential of activist cultural festivals to shift symbolic boundaries in the long run and serve as tools of social inclusion.

T1  - Examining the racial-ethnic continuum and perceptions of police misconduct
AN  - 2258621443
AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2266690833
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - Comrades in the Struggle? Feminist Women Prefer Male Allies Who Offer Autonomy- not Dependency-Oriented Help
AN  - 2117646322
AB  - Feminist women view feminist men who take a backseat and offer partial help (i.e., autonomy-oriented support) as better allies than those who attempt to solve the problem themselves and who impose their will on the movement (i.e., dependency-oriented support). We support this idea in two experiments (ns = 96; 270) conducted in the United States. Further, we show that this preference is limited to women who are most motivated to challenge gender inequality, that is, those who strongly identify with feminists (Study 2). Our findings are important because although men are more willing to challenge gender inequality if they identify with feminists (Wiley et al. 2013), not all allied support is wanted or even helpful (Droogendyk et al. 2016), and some feminist men run the risk of reinforcing the very gender hierarchy that they seek to dismantle. Our studies shift the focus in research on allied activism from whether men will support women when they challenge gender inequality to what kind of support women actually want. Implications for psychological research on intergroup relations and feminist scholarship are considered.

T1  - When Essentialism Facilitates Intergroup Conflict Resolution: The Positive Role of Perspective-Taking
AN  - 2205312158
AB  - Essentialism, a fundamental belief of the fixedness of social group essences, is often associated with negative intergroup outcomes. However, research is yet to explore the role of essentialism in intergroup conflicts, despite their prevalence. To address this gap, we conducted the first direct examination on how essentialism influences conflict management toward out-group members. Moreover, we examined perspective-taking as a positive factor in improving conflict management among essentialist individuals relative to their non-essentialist counterparts in intergroup contexts. Results across three experiments provided little support to the negative effect of essentialism on intergroup (vs. intragroup) conflict management. Yet, we found that perspective-taking promoted the use of problem solving and improved one’s own gain and the dyad’s joint gain among essentialist individuals, but not non-essentialist individuals, in intergroup (vs. intragroup) conflict situations. This research suggests that when coupled with perspective-taking, essentialism can promote constructive conflict resolution in intergroup contexts.

T1  - Persuasion and ballot initiatives: how persuasive were the televised campaign ads on same-sex marriage?
AN  - 2571083685
AB  - Initiative campaigns, unlike candidate-centered elections, are efforts to mobilize and persuade residents of state and local governments on specific policies. Previous studies have conflicting findings whether or not initiative campaigns can persuade voters. For issues like same-sex marriage, voters may be even more difficult to persuade because their attitudes may be crystallized. Four states voted on marriage equality in November 2012, which resulted in historic victories for the proponents of same-sex marriage. This led to a belief that the marriage equality campaigns won because of their strategic communications. I examine the effect of televised campaign ads on people’s attitudes toward same-sex marriage by combining market-advertising data from the 2012 campaigns and a rolling cross-sectional national survey. Media markets that spill over into neighboring states are analyzed as a natural experiment, isolating the effect of televised advertisements from other campaign efforts. The results suggest that people were greatly affected by campaign ads aired by the groups opposed to marriage equality, and the ads in favor of marriage equality were ineffective. When competing sides are framing the rights of sexual and gender minorities, those opposed retain an unequal advantage in changing the minds of the public through televised media.

T1  - Intergroup contact and helping: How quality contact and empathy shape outgroup helping: GPIR
AN  - 2133225258
AB  - Do previous intergroup contact experiences predispose a person to be more inclined to help outgroup members? The present work explores whether the quality of one’s contact experiences with an outgroup is associated with outgroup helping. Across two studies, we examine the relation between intergroup contact (quantity and quality of contact), empathy (Study 1 and Study 2), anxiety (Study 2), and helping intentions across a variety of dimensions and behaviors (Study 1 and Study 2), as well as level of commitment to helping outgroup members (Study 2). Across both studies, quality, more than quantity, contact was associated with increases in outgroup helping intentions, which was explained (i.e., mediated) by empathy. In addition, quality contact was also associated with increased commitment to help an outgroup, which was also explained by empathy. Implications for intergroup helping and emotions are discussed.

T1  - The Cultural-Cognitive Mapping of Scientific Professions
AN  - 2042481769
AB  - Even with widespread interest, public perceptions of science remain understudied and poorly theorized by social scientists. A central issue has been the persistent assumption that publics require a base of scientific knowledge for science to have broad cultural meaning. Yet, recent advances in cultural and cognitive sociology point to alternative research programs seeking to identify how publics come to understand complex and uncertain issues, when information is incomplete and asymmetric. We use this approach to analyze data on public perceptions of how scientific different fields are from the 2006 and 2012 National Science Foundation’s Science and Technology Survey. Our multivariate analyses allow us to approximate how mass publics map the social space of scientific professions, while accounting for individuals’ social location and cultural identity (e.g., race, class, gender, age, scientific sophistication, and political ideology). We then focus our attention on public perceptions of sociology and economics. Overall, we find that public perceptions, rather than being disorganized, map onto recognizable dimensions indicating how publics distinguish between scientific professions.

T1  - Intergroup contact versus conflict in Catalan high schools: A multilevel analysis of adolescent attitudes toward immigration and diversity
AN  - 2085137629
AB  - Western educational systems are often insufficiently prepared for the ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity resulting from immigration. In Catalonia, one of the wealthiest regions of Spain, a diverse, recent, and large-scale immigration coincides with a popular nationalist movement and increasingly salient national identifications. Focusing on a context where ethnic, national, religious, and linguistic divisions intersect daily, our aim was to determine if both beneficial and detrimental effects of intergroup contact exist by measuring three separate dependent variables, xenophobia, appreciation of diversity, and attitudes toward immigrant rights, among native (n = 1219) and nonnative (n = 379) students during their last year of compulsory education (10th grade). Multilevel modeling, with students nested within 82 classrooms in 30 high schools throughout Catalonia, revealed effects of national identifications, frequency of contact, socioeconomic status, and classroom ethnic composition. Results provide strong support for intergroup contact theory in that classrooms with higher proportions of immigrant students demonstrated less xenophobia and more positive attitudes towards immigrant rights overall. Implications of classroom characteristics were qualified by national identification and intergroup interactions. Simultaneously, modest detrimental implications of intergroup contact were unveiled in that higher proportions of immigrants in a classroom predicted lower appreciation of diversity; immigrants were more likely to embrace diversity when they were a minority in the classroom, though native and immigrant students were both low on appreciation of diversity in majority-immigrant classrooms. Findings also highlight the critical importance of national identification in a context where national identities are often contested.

T1  - Stereotypes as Pseudocontingencies
AN  - 2025287184
AB  - We introduce a heuristic called pseudocontingencies (PCs) as an alternative account of various stereotyping phenomena. PCs give rise to the expectation that attributes are correlated based solely on asymmetries in attribute base rates. Attributes that are encountered frequently and attributes that are encountered rarely are perceived to be correlated with each other. Such differences in information densities are typical of many stereotyped targets, including the self vs. others, the in-group vs. out-groups and majority vs. minority groups. Evidence is reviewed for PCs underlying illusory correlations, confirmation biases, gender stereotypes, Simpson's paradox, and in procedures used for implicit stereotype measurement. PCs are shown to predict specific patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation, the effects of intergroup contact on in-group biases and the readiness to infer stereotypes from aggregated "big-data". Although PCs can lead to seriously flawed stereotypic expectations, they afford an efficient and possibly adaptive inference strategy.

T1  - "If You Don't Like Gay Marriage, Don't Get One!": A Qualitative Analysis of Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage in South Australia
AN  - 1969031779
AB  - Prejudice against sexual-minority groups has continuously declined in Australia over the past several decades, yet inequality in marriage policy that denies legal recognition of same-sex relationships remains. Social role theory suggests this may be due in part to traditional beliefs about gender roles that fuel concerns regarding the ability of same-sex couples to raise children because they violate these social norms and roles. The current study identified reasons behind support of, or opposition to, same-sex marriage. Data were collected from a community sample (n = 536) in South Australia through an open-ended question included on a larger survey. Content analysis suggested that gender role norms do play a part in negative attitudes toward same-sex marriage as well as perceptions of same-sex couples' ability to raise children. Our findings also revealed heteronormativity embedded in the responses of participants both for and against marriage equality. Implications for advocacy efforts focused on marriage equality, parenting by same-sex couples, and the focus for future research endeavours in this substantive domain are discussed.

T1  - "Us Against Them" or "All Humans Are Equal": Intergroup Attitudes and Perceived Parental Socialization of Muslim Immigrant and Native Dutch Youth
AN  - 1978439991
AB  - Intergroup attitudes of Muslim immigrant youth and native youth in the Netherlands were examined in relation to perceived parental socialization. Our aim was to gain insights into parent-child (dis)similarity in antagonistic and egalitarian attitudes and to understand differences between these two groups in this respect. Data come from qualitative interviews with 22 Turkish Dutch, Moroccan Dutch, and native Dutch youth (aged 16-22) who were prone either to intergroup antagonism (i.e., held hostile and negative attitudes toward out-groups) or to egalitarianism (held egalitarian attitudes). Interviews were analyzed using the constant comparison method. Results show that in the majority youth group, egalitarianism as well as intergroup antagonism were quite comparable across two generations. The attitudes of Muslim minority youth diverged more from those of their parents and appeared to be related to the pedagogic relationship between parents and children. Minority youth prone to antagonism perceived a lack of adequate parental responses to their negative experiences in the context of Islamophobia. Egalitarian minority youth reported that their parents were quite sensitive to their communications about perceived exclusion and that they responded with advice and support. Findings are discussed with reference to the social learning theory and the ethnic socialization strategies identified by Hughes et al.

AN  - 1906151500
AB  - I very much appreciate Jennifer Hochschild’s thoughtful commentary on my article, “When Work Disappears: New Implications for Race and Urban Poverty in the Global Economy” (1999). She focuses on two important areas that, in her judgment, were not sufficiently addressed in my article, namely a “comparative analysis of the impact of collective joblessness across racial and ethnic groups”, and the “political impact of sustained and concentrated joblessness”. I welcome the opportunity to respond directly to her arguments.

T1  - Testing Theories of Gun Policy Preferences Among Blacks, Latinos, and Whites in America*
AN  - 1910062402
AB  - Objective 
Research examining the factors shaping gun policy attitudes has focused on the general population or whites. Little is known about how self-interest, political values, or racial prejudice shape the gun policy preferences of minorities. We seek to assess the effect of self-interest, political values, and racial prejudice on the gun policy attitudes of whites, Latinos, and blacks. We also introduce a measure of prejudice difference in group violence--which has not been previously used in the literature on gun policy opinion. 
Methods 
We use data from a new survey (2015) and analyze whites, blacks, and Latinos separately. 
Results 
We find that many of the drivers of support for gun control found in the general population apply to minorities as well, but the substantive effects vary across groups. Similar to prior general population findings, we find that for all groups concern about crime is associated with more support for gun control, and that gun ownership, being the victim of a crime, and conservative political values are associated with less support. 
Conclusion 
In contrast, we find that racial prejudice is negatively correlated with support for gun control among whites and Latinos, while one type of racial prejudice--racial resentment--increases support for gun control among blacks.

T1  - Intergenerational negotiations on (hetero)sexuality and romantic relationships - views of young people and parents in multi-ethnic contexts
AN  - 1886292855
AB  - This article focuses on intergenerational negotiations on young people's (13-19 years) sexuality and romantic relationships in families where one or both of the parents have migrated to Finland. By utilising the theoretical framework of intersectionality and negotiability of family relationships, we seek to diversify the often problem-oriented and culture-related examinations of ethnic minority families and young people's position in them. Methodologically, we draw on interview data relating to both young people and parents. In addition to the vast heterogeneity in practices and ideals, the analysis shows that while conflicts and miscommunication between generations do occur, the intergenerational negotiations for the most part are described as consensual and based on trust. Young people are allotted considerable agency by their parents, and also demonstrate a high degree of agency, whether they are complying with their parents' views or questioning them. Their negotiations also reflect and are conditioned by their position in the hierarchies of Finnish society.

T1  - Don't Read This: One Higher Education Administrator's Perspective on the Urgency of Emptiness and Social Justice
AN  - 2116060480
AB  - Mistler shared his perspective on the urgency of emptiness and social justice as a higher education administrator. He said that he was writing based on his own perspective and not speak for any group, r ace, class, gender or otherwise. He noted that he s till feel like an outsider himself even if he is readily identified by others as a member of the visible majority group. It is clear that issues faced by some groups are more dangerous, more pervasive and very urgent, while no group is immune to being the target of prejudice or unjust discrimination. He highlighted the need to cultivate the various practices of developing emptiness and receptivity toward voluntary giving away power and possession once a person realized that holding on to fractured/fracturing identities destroys environmental-peace, bodily-peace and inner-peace.

T1  - Race/Ethnicity and Justice in Academia
AN  - 1891794967
AB  - Race and ethnicity are common themes in criminology and criminal justice. Research has consistently shown that African Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities, such as Latinos, are overrepresented as victims and offenders in violent crime when compared to Caucasians (Sampson, Morenoff, & Raudenbush, 2005). Consequently, they are also overrepresented in the arrestee and prison populations (Walker, Spohn, & DeLone, 2012.) Relatedly, studies have also demonstrated an intersectionality effect in which race, ethnicity, gender, and social class affect criminal behavior and the response by criminal justice agencies (Barak, Flavin, * Leighton, 2001; Spohn & Holleran, 2000). Specifically, African American males who are of low economic standing are more likely to be victims and offenders of crime and are also more likely to be represented in criminal justice agencies as arrestees and inmates. Given the importance of race and ethnicity, criminologists spend a lot of time examining how these variables affect criminal behavior, victimization, and the response by criminal justice institutions, and a plethora of research has accumulated that explore these issues and their consequences.

T1  - Using Groups to Measure Intergroup Prejudice
AN  - 1851015712
AB  - Implicit measures of racial attitudes often assess reactions to images of individuals to infer attitudes toward an entire social category. However, an increasing amount of research indicates that responses to individuals are highly dependent on context and idiosyncratic features of individual exemplars. Thus, using images of individuals to assess beliefs about a whole social category may not be ideal. Across three time points, we predicted that using images of groups would mitigate the influence of idiosyncratic features of individual targets and, thus, provide a better measurement tool to assess beliefs about a category to which all group members belong. Results revealed that an implicit measure that presented images of Black and White groups had greater construct validity, test-retest reliability, and predictive validity as compared with an implicit measure that presented the same exemplars individually. We conclude that groups provide a window into existing beliefs about social categories.

T1  - The opportunities and challenges of diversity: Explaining its impact on individuals and groups
AN  - 1891309316
AB  - Demographic trends reveal that modern societies have become increasingly diverse. Within the social sciences, these changes have been reflected in concerns about the implications of social diversity. Although early research noted that diversity may have negative consequences for societies and individuals, more recent scholarship has indicated that diversity is not always translated into negative outcomes. These inconsistent findings initiated a scholarly debate concerning the impact of many different forms of diversity for a host of social outcomes. It is now clear that the boundary conditions of these effects are yet to be fully understood. This Special Issue offers a collection of research advances identifying mediating and moderating variables addressing when and why diversity impacts intergroup relational outcomes. By focusing on different levels of diversity (i.e., in the society and in groups), this research also sheds light on the effectiveness of ideologies and policies for managing diversity.

AB  - This paper explores the role of ethnolinguistic vitality and intergroup contact in changing attitudes and the interest to learn Hungarian among Slovak-speaking secondary school students in Southern Slovakia (N = 225). Several indirect paths linking the all these variables were found. In general, lower local ethnolinguistic vitality of Hungarian decreased intergroup anxiety and increased the quality of contact with members of the Hungarian minority, which led to a more positive attitude toward the Hungarian minority, and enhanced the interest to learn Hungarian.

T1  - Friends or Foes: The Impact of Political Ideology and Immigrant Friends on Anti-Immigrant Sentiment
AN  - 1868554422
AB  - In recent years, an increase in anti-immigrant sentiment has been witnessed in the United States, particularly from politically conservative groups. According to intergroup contact theory, increased contact between in-group and out-group members, especially cross-group friendships, has been found to reduce intergroup prejudice. This study analyzed nationally representative U.S.-based data (n = 1,000) from the Transatlantic Trends Survey, 2013 to examine if having immigrant friends interacted with political ideology, such that having immigrant friends weakened the association between conservative ideology and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings revealed that immigrant friends and political ideology each had a significant but opposite main effect on anti-immigrant sentiment, but that having immigrant friends did not moderate or buffer the effects of political ideology on anti-immigrant sentiment. Thus, aligning with a conservative political ideology is associated with anti-immigrant sentiment irrespective of having immigrant friends. Strategies to increase intergroup contact and promote cross-group friendships are made and directions for future research are offered.

T1  - A century of miri piri: securing Sikh belonging in Canada
AN  - 1817876290
AB  - In this paper we reflect on the Komagata Maru as a fundamental foreshadowing of a century of Sikh negotiation with the Canadian state to achieve inclusion and belonging. The commitment of Gurdit Singh, who charted the vessel, is emblematic of miri piri, the idea that the spiritual and political cannot be separated in the fight for justice. We use miri piri as a lens through which to examine a century of Sikh struggle in Canada since the Komagata Maru. We examine four cases of Sikh-led social activism that illustrate the spirit of miri piri - the integration of the spiritual and the political in the act of resistance against injustice. Our cases include the demand for refugee rights, recognition and inclusion of minority veterans, the protection of minority groups in the wake of 9/11, and the fight to protect religious expression in Quebec. We then address what we believe is missing in Sikh social activism in terms of fighting for gender and caste equality within Sikh communities themselves. We conclude with a reflection on the fact that Sikh spirituality has greatly enhanced the social fabric of Canada, but that the struggle for rights remains a daily one that Canadian Sikhs must address both within and outside their own communities.

T1  - Does education 'trump' nationality? Boundary-drawing practices among highly educated migrants from Turkey
AN  - 1807591308
AB  - Inspired by a super-diversity approach, this paper seeks to explore the influence of the 'ethnic hierarchy' of 'old' minority groups over the way 'new' migrants from Turkey negotiate their interaction in the daily life in three settings: Amsterdam, London and Barcelona. By focusing on highly educated migrants from Turkey who by virtue of their country of origin or religion are positioned at the bottom of 'ethnic hierarchies', it strives to understand the significance of these different sources of diversity in daily interaction. Applying boundary-drawing strategies developed for ethnic boundaries, this paper argues that education does not necessarily 'trump' nationality, but allows for substantial claims of difference. New migrants from Turkey carve out a space for themselves by on the one hand homogenizing Turkish or other Muslim communities through attributing 'unwanted' behaviours and on the other re-defining the boundaries of their individual identity with emphasis on different sources of diversity.

AB  - We examine differences in the intensity of employer stereotypes of men and women with Arabic names in Sweden by testing how much work experience is needed to eliminate the disadvantage of having an Arabic name on job applications. Employers are first sent curriculum vitaes (CVs) of equal merit in a field experiment setup. Arabic-named CVs are thereafter enhanced with more relevant work experience than Swedish-named CVs. The results indicate a reverse gender gap in employer stereotypes because initial differences in the number of callbacks disappear for female applicants when Arabic-named CVs are enhanced but remain strong and significant for male applicants. Thus, contrary to what is often assumed about the interaction of gender and ethnicity, we find that Arabic men face stronger discrimination in the labor market than Arabic women.

T1  - Institutional Allyship for LGBT Equality: Underlying Processes and Potentials for Change
AN  - 1793546255
AB  - Discussions of outgroup activism in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) equality reflect two shortcomings. First, such discussions generally present uncritically positive views of ally activism; second, research on ally activism has overly focused on individual allies. The aim of this article is twofold: to suggest that action toward LGBT equality may often be influenced by sexual prejudice and may thus recapitulate longstanding power dynamics between majority and sexual minority groups, and to expand our understanding of ally behavior beyond individuals by presenting an ethnographic study exploring the development of institutional ally identity in a mainstream church that underwent a marked shift from an explicit anti-LGBT to an expressly LGBT-supportive stance. The study employed critical discourse analysis to examine interview, textual, and participant-observation data. Dimensions of individual and institutional ally activism, and potential pitfalls in each, are explored. Suggestions for promoting more constructive collective action are offered.

T1  - Attentional Biases Toward Latinos
AN  - 1785500819
AB  - The current research examined attention allocation to assess whether people preferentially attend to Latino versus White faces. The current work also tested whether this attentional bias depended on whether the task involved a bi-ethnic context (only Latino and White faces) or a multi-ethnic context (Black, Latino, and White faces). Attention was measured with an exogenous cueing task that assessed attentional capture and holding toward faces of each racial group. Results showed that Latino faces captured attention faster and held attention longer than White faces. This attentional bias was evident in both bi-ethnic and multi-ethnic racial contexts.

T1  - A TEST OF THE AFRO CARIBBEAN MODEL MINORITY HYPOTHESIS
AN  - 1801833389
AB  - Throughout the twentieth century, Black immigrants from the Caribbean attained greater socioeconomic status than African Americans. Although Black immigrants remain an understudied population, recent studies show that Afro Caribbeans continue to outperform African Americans in the labor market. Given that these groups share a set of racialized physical features, some contend that this gap highlights the role of cultural attributes in the manufacture of Black ethnic and Black-White racial disparities. In this study, I investigate the degree to which cultural attributes associated with a specific form of the model minority hypothesis are responsible for disparities between African Americans and Afro Caribbeans. I use data from the National Survey of American Life in order to test for the relative roles of work ethic, economic autonomy, oppositionality, family structure and function, and racial attitudes in the manufacture of disparate labor market outcomes between African Americans and Afro Caribbeans. I find mixed support for the idea that Afro Caribbeans constitute a model minority vis-à-vis African Americans and that differences in model minority attributes are only partially responsible for these labor market disparities. My findings suggest that racial inequality will not be undone if the racially stigmatized and marginalized simply work harder and complain less about race and racism in the United States.

T1  - The vicious circle of religious prejudice: Islamophobia makes the acculturation attitudes of majority and minority members clash
AN  - 1790523724
AB  - Public discourse often portrays Islam as the main obstacle for Muslim minorities' integration, paying little attention to the contextual factors hindering this process. Here, we focus on islamophobia as one destructive factor that hinders the mutual integration between Muslim minority and Western majority members, affecting both groups. In Study 1, the more islamophobic majority members were, the more they expected Muslims to give up their heritage culture and the less they wanted them to integrate. In Study 2, only when Muslims experienced substantial religious discrimination did religious identity negatively relate to national engagement and particularly positively relate to ethnic engagement. Together, the studies suggest that religious prejudice in the form of islamophobia is a major obstacle to Muslims' integration because it increases the incongruity between majority and minority members' acculturation attitudes.

T1  - The specter of discrimination: Fear of interpersonal racial discrimination among adolescents in Chicago
AN  - 1764861552
AB  - This analysis examines fear of interpersonal racial discrimination among Black, Hispanic, and White adolescents. The extent and correlates of these concerns are examined using survey data from the Project for Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. Borrowing from the fear-of-crime literature, the contact hypothesis, and group threat theory, several hypotheses are developed linking discrimination fear to direct personal experience with discrimination, indirect or vicarious experience, and environmental signals of discrimination. Results show that about half of Blacks and Hispanics have feared discrimination in the past year. Multivariate results indicate that fear is most likely if one has experienced victimization first-hand and when one's parent is affected by discrimination. Further, a larger presence neighborhood outgroups produces greater fear. Overall, discrimination fear constitutes an additional obstacle for minority adolescents as they transition to adulthood. The phenomenon warrants increased scholarly attention and represents a fruitful avenue for future research.

T1  - One Size May Not Fit All: The Need for a More Inclusive and Intersectional Psychological Science on Stigma
AN  - 1719467689
AB  - In their review, Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ) articulated how models of stigma fall short of explaining stigmatization of women of color, because they do not consider intersectionality of multiple stigmatized identities. Using the example of the intersection of race and gender, they reviewed literature on how targets of stigma detect and respond to prejudice (making prejudice attributions, the role of identity processes such as centrality), highlighting the complexity of these processes once multiple identities (namely non-prototypical categories of race and gender) are considered. In response, we provide more in depth discussion of the challenges to inclusion and intersectionality including current and traditional psychological science approaches and the perceived politicization of intersectional research, as well as the complexity of integrating multiple identities (social class, sexual orientation and gender diversity) into stigma research, including recruitment, measurement, and analysis. We offer practical suggestions in the areas of recruitment, measurement, and analysis, to facilitate more inclusive and intersectional research, given that such work would provide a more complete understanding of the experience of stigma.

AN  - 1788496117
AB  - The present study examines how self-enhancement and self-protection function within a group context regarding people's ingroup and outgroup judgments. Results demonstrated basic self-enhancement and self-protection effects such that participants routinely rated themselves higher on the positive traits and lower on the negative traits than either the group or a past participant. Participants' judgments regarding the outgroup member mimicked this rating pattern; however, their judgments concerning the ingroup were mixed. Interestingly, participants were actually self-critical at times and in some cases engaged in self-derogation, rating themselves lower on positive traits and higher on negative traits.

T1  - Return Migration Intentions in the Integration-Transnationalism Matrix
AN  - 1667951537; 201509445
AB  - This article asks how return migration intentions are shaped by ties to the country of residence on the one hand, and ties to the country of origin on the other. We discuss these two sets of ties in terms of immigrant integration and transnationalism, respectively. A central tenet of the study is that, at the individual level, integration and transnationalism are neither related in a predictable way nor independent of each other. In our analysis we take methodological steps that reflect this argument, and introduce an integration-transnationalism matrix. In the empirical analysis we use quantitative survey data (N = 3,053) on ten large immigrant groups in Norway, collected by Statistics Norway in 2005-06. We find that it is the relative strength of integration and transnationalism that is decisive for return migration intentions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Off white: colour-blind ideology at the margins of whiteness
AN  - 1667950810; 201509653
AB  - This study examines the relationship between racial contestation and colour-blind ideology adherence. Using the first nationally representative study to ask respondents directly about personal racial identity and external racial ascription, I compare the racial conceptualizations of contested and non-contested whites. Contested whites are individuals who identify racially as white, but who are perceived by others as non-white. Contested whites find themselves at the margins of whiteness, betwixt and between categories of racial dominance and racial marginalization. One might hypothesize that because contested whites are socially perceived as non-white, that they would be more aware of racial marginalization in social life, and would therefore exhibit more progressive racial views. However, this study finds that the opposite is true. Results of ordinal logistic regression analyses suggest that individuals placed at the margins of whiteness may seek to legitimate group membership as white by expressing similar and sometimes even amplified notions of colourblindness than their non-contested white counterparts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racially Charged Legislation and Latino Health Disparities: The Case of Arizona's S.B. 1070
AN  - 1667952143; 201509411
AB  - Researchers have established that minority groups tend to suffer worse health outcomes compared to their white counterparts, though the specific mechanisms at play are still under investigation. The passing of Arizona's 2010 'Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act,' commonly referred to as 'S.B. 1070,' provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of an increasingly racially charged milieu on Latino health. Using the Arizona sample of the 2009-2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we find that the changing social setting around S.B. 1070 is related to poorer Latino self-reported health, but only for those whose primary language is Spanish. Furthermore, serving as control groups, we find no such relationship in other U.S.-Mexico border states that had no analogous legislation (Texas, New Mexico, and California). We expand on stress process theory and group position theory to explain this increase in Arizona's negative health reporting, despite traditional social and economic protective factors.

T1  - Testing the Relationship between Nationalism and Racism: Greek-Cypriot Students' National/Ethnic Identities and Attitudes to Ethnic Out-groups
AN  - 1667951946; 201509635
AB  - This article builds on a growing body of research that shows an intrinsic but complex relationship between the concepts and the ideologies of nationalism and racism. In doing so, it investigates how different, meaningful national and ethnic in-group identifications of a dominant national/ethnic group (Greek-Cypriots) within a given national context (Cyprus) influence their perceptions of different, meaningful ethnic and racial minority out-groups. Logistic regression analysis of quantitative survey data with secondary school children (N = 738) in Cyprus shows that the relationship between national/ethnic in-group identifications and out-group perceptions varies according to the social and political relationships between particular national/ethnic in- and out-groups. The findings show that future research on the relationship between nationalism and racism should consider the overlap between and context specific nature of national and ethnic in-group identification processes and the historical, political relationships between different in- and out-groups.

T1  - From Favourites to 'With No Return': Permanence and Mobility of Latin American Immigration in Spain during the 21st Century
AN  - 1635422336
AB  - Cet article a pour but, d'analyser d'abord les raisons qui sous-tendent la montée de l'immigration latino-américaine vers l'Espagne durant la période 2000-2013 et, ensuite d'expliquer pourquoi ce groupe persiste à rester dans ce pays malgré l'intensité de la crise économique et la destruction massive de l'emploi. Il démontre qu'autant les raisons de rester en Espagne que celles de se délocaliser, sont influencées, non seulement par le cycle économique, mais aussi le degré d'intégration accomplie par ce groupe, ainsi que par d'autres facteurs en rapport avec le contexte de leur pays d'origine.              Other international legal rules that kept that pre-eminence for certain chosen countries were added to the regularization policies favouring permanence of Latin Americans. That preferential choice was materialised in the establishment of bilateral agreements for annual quotas of workers'0 and in the imposition of visas. The aim was to select the nationalities settling in Spain and to control migration flows. When visas were imposed on Colombia and Ecuador (2001 and 2003), the inflow dropped, but the majority of immigrants had already entered into Spain, and the inertia of family regrouping completed the large stock. A similar case was that of the visas being imposed on Bolivians in 2007, when it was already impossible to control the inflow. In the case of Latin American immigration, the economic factors, such as the housing boom and the informal economy in the sectors of construction, agriculture, and above all, domestic work, were added to the weakness of external controls and the clear religious and cultural preference shown by public opinion towards these 'descendants and colonised,' as well as their fast rate of absorption (naturalisation, language, religion) and their make-up (féminisation and family), which favours integration. Neither social cohesion, nor public expense on integration was thought to be costly or difficult. The 'family centredness' and the Catholicism of Spanish society formed the cement and the foundation of social acceptance.              This is reflected in the attitudes and policies with respect to the copious immigration of the first decade of the 21st century. The most consistent opinion poll data show that Spain's social acceptance was greater in terms of cultural assimilation than in adequacy of employment. In more social-scientific terms, the majority of Spanish people cared more about religion, language, customs and the ethnic appearance of the immigrants than about their social class. It was not for nothing that the most popular question in the last surveys by the CIS (2001 and 2012) showed that the main requirement to facilitate immigrants' entry in Spain was that 'they are willing to adopt the country's way of life,' with an average of 8.0 on a scale of 0 to 10. The second most popular requirement for opening the doors to them was that 'they had a work qualification that Spain needed,' with an average value of 7.4 in 2011. And it is precisely in these historical and cultural preferences where Latin American immigration has a legal and social advantage. The different concentrations and settlement patterns of the immigrant communities show their adjustment to the community diversity in Spain. The 'Spanish' model of immigrant integration is not so much legal and political, but more geared towards fitting in within the diversity puzzle.

T1  - Bridging the Race Barrier: Between 'Sakai' and 'Malay' in the Census Categorisations of British Malaya
AN  - 1660024515; 201505709
AB  - Racial boundary-making has been an oft highlighted theme in the study of colonialism. The most overt symbol of British attempts to make sense of the peoples in the Malay Peninsula is the classification of people according to 'race' in the censuses conducted during the colonial period. Drawing on studies of censuses which aim to denaturalise essentialised racial categories, I aim to complicate the depiction of British categorisation in order to show that races and the social identities on which they were based were not static by discussing the gradations incorporated into the census between 'Sakai', the indigenous peoples, and 'Malays', the main native group in Malaya. Introduced in 1911, the category of 'tame Sakai' was a way of quantifying individuals who could not be categorised as either indigenous or Malay. In the process, however, the factors for inclusion in the original Malay and aboriginal categories themselves became subject to debate. Though in many instances racial classification amounted to a rigidifying of identities, the case of 'tame Sakai' highlights an instance of uncertain categorisation which was outwardly acknowledged within the census. The various discourses pulling at the Sakai category show races not as ideal existing types of humans, but as a complex and sometimes contradictory manner of understanding people in Malaya. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What Does National Resilience Mean in a Democracy? Evidence from the United States and Israel
AN  - 1728662493; 201534635
AB  - Given various challenges to national security in democracies, such as terrorism and political violence, a growing need for reconceptualization of the term 'resilience' emerges. The interface between national security and resilience is rooted in individuals' perceptions and attitudes toward institutions and leadership. Therefore, in this article, we suggest that political-psychological features form the basis of citizens' perceived definitions of national resilience. By comparing national resilience definitions composed by citizens of two democratic countries facing national threats of war and terrorism, the United States and Israel, we found that perceived threats, optimism, and public attitudes such as patriotism and trust in governmental institutions, are the most frequent components of the perceived national resilience. On the basis of these results, a reconceptualization of the term 'national resilience' is presented. This can lead to validation of how resilience is measured and provide grounds for further examination of this concept in other democratic countries.

T1  - Racism: Less is More
AN  - 1667951018; 201509511
AB  - Racism has been in sharp decline in recent decades yet the word, as accusation, is used more than ever. The word/idea needs to be more restrictively defined and kept for when it is really needed. When almost everyone is a racist, no one is. To this end we need to distinguish more clearly between the greater comfort people often feel among familiar people and places and active hostility towards outsider ethnic groups. We also need a more discriminating language to describe the spectrum of discrimination. Prejudice, clannishness-even in some instances discrimination itself-should be regarded as sentiments and behaviours that are distinct from proper racism. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In the post-9/11 American imagination, stereotypical images of the terrorist from the Middle East and the illegal migrant worker from south of the US border consistently appear in media and rhetoric. Dominant US representations of Latinos and Middle Eastern Muslims shape not only how US government and media construes them as 'Brown Threats,' but also how citizens in the US interpret these minority groups as dangerous, foreign, inauthentic and brown(ed) Americans. By analyzing law, rhetoric and visual culture, the concept of the Brown Threat interrogates contemporary conflations of Latinos and Middle Eastern Muslims. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A kin-state's responsibility: Cultural identity, recognition, and the Hungarian status law
AN  - 1531933755; 201423387
AB  - In the last 30 years, many European states have assumed a form of responsibility for recognition concerning the cultural identity of the members of their kin-minority groups. Despite the increasing number of states assuming such special trans-sovereign duties relating to individuals who are neither citizens nor residents, and the endorsements given by the Council of Europe and the EU, a conceptual analysis and normative evaluation of identity recognition as a kin-state's duty remains absent from the literature on liberal multiculturalism. Focusing on the case of the Hungarian Status Law, this article problematizes identity recognition as a kin-state's responsibility, examining its legitimacy, place and limits in liberal multiculturalism. Against the current consensus in liberal multiculturalism, I argue that, although the primary responsibility for identity recognition lies with the home-state, a kin-state can complement the home-state's duties.

T1  - Effects of Sanskrit Schooling on Cognitive and Social Processes
AN  - 1520336764; 201417684
AB  - The article discusses effects of Sanskrit schooling, a traditional system of education in India, which has continued for several thousand years. Sanskrit schooling continues to be in operation in India, but has been pushed out to the margins after the introduction of formal Western-type schooling by the British. A set of studies demonstrating the influence of traditional Sanskrit and formal Western forms of schooling on children's cognitive and social processes is discussed. These specifically include studies of learning and memory, psychological differentiation, spatial language and encoding, dead reckoning, meta-cognition, social identity and prejudice, intergroup relationships and daily activities, practices and values. The article also discusses potential areas for cross-cultural collaborative research relating to psychological development of children.

T1  - Multicultural Citizenship and Religiosity: Young Australian Muslims Forging a Sense of Belonging after 9/11
AN  - 1531932640; 201424980
AB  - This article investigates the role religiosity plays in the ways young Australian Muslims enact themselves as citizens in a context in which their right to belong to the political community is often seriously questioned. Australian responses to 9/11, 7/7 and the Cronulla Riots have relied on an understanding of Muslim youth identity that sees young Muslims' religiosity primarily as a barrier to the development of good citizenship practices. Against this backdrop, this article explores the ways in which religiosity informs the everyday acts of citizenship through which young Muslims challenge dominant narratives of citizenship. Drawing on an ethnographic study of two Melbourne-based Shia youth groups, I look at the subjective accounts of multicultural citizenship that youth group members shared in the course of the groups' weekly activities. In doing so, I draw particular attention to the role religion plays in the imaginative ways young Australian Muslims fashion themselves into citizens. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Aging Out: A Qualitative Exploration of Ageism and Heterosexism Among Aging African American Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1504423493; 201405554
AB  - African Americans elders, like their non-African American counterparts, are not a homogeneous group; however an early characteristic placed on all African Americans is in their shared history in the United States. As members of multiple minority groups, older lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people of African descent have survived racism, heterosexism, homophobia, and now ageism. This article describes a qualitative study grounded in Black feminist and minority stress theories that explored the issues of perceived social discrimination and alienation of 15 older African American lesbians and gay males whose lived experiences were captured using in-depth, face-to-face interviews. Several themes were identified in the study, including (a) Sense of Alienation in the African American Community, (b) Deliberate Concealment of Sexual Identity and Orientation, (c) Aversion to LGBT Labels, (d) Perceived Discrimination and Alienation From Organized Religion, (e) Feelings of Grief and Loss Related to Aging, (f) Isolation, and (g) Fear of Financial and Physical Dependence. The implication of the findings suggests that the ethos and needs of older African American lesbian women and gay men need to be addressed to eliminate potential barriers to successful aging for this cohort.

T1  - Yielding to the sons of the soil: Abkhazian democracy and the marginalization of the Armenian vote
AN  - 1520341486; 201413206
AB  - Among the post-Soviet de facto states, Abkhazia is unique in that the secessionists pursued self-determination in the name of a minority group. Today the ethnic Abkhaz enjoy a virtual monopoly on political power. Simultaneously, Abkhazia has developed a reasonably democratic political system. How has it been possible for the ethnic Abkhaz to monopolize power within a political system that exhibits most of the trappings of democratic rule? We discuss four alternative theories of ethnic marginalization to explain why the Armenians, the largest minority community in Abkhazia, have abstained from translating numerical strength into political influence. We argue that it is essential to examine sentiments and behaviour not only among the dominant group, but just as much among the marginalized group. Particularly relevant is the pervasive perception that rights in and 'ownership' of a territory are linked to 'rootedness'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Putting stigma in context: Do perceptions of group stigma interact with personally experienced discrimination to predict mental health?
AN  - 1504423287; 201405301
AB  - Research has linked experiences of personal discrimination with negative mental health consequences, but less is known about the role of group stigma (perceived stigma against one's group as a whole). The theoretical literature has offered mixed predictions. The present study examined the independent and interactive effects of group stigma and personal discrimination on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in a sample of gay and bisexual men (N = 986). Experiences of personal discrimination predicted depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation regardless of group stigma. However, group stigma was associated with depressive symptoms contextually-only when level of perceived personal discrimination was low. Personal discrimination may be a relatively more powerful force in the lives of stigmatized group members that overwhelms the influence of group stigma in harming mental health.

T1  - Occupational Adjustment of Immigrants in The Netherlands
AN  - 1504421994; 201405556
AB  - This article examines the speed of the occupational adjustment of immigrants using Labour Force Surveys 2004 and 2005 from Statistics Netherlands. The analysis provides new evidence that immigrants start with jobs at the lower levels of skill distribution. Their occupational achievement improves significantly with the duration of residence. The extent of this initial disadvantage and the rate of adjustment vary across immigrant groups according to the transferability of skills associated with their cultural and linguistic distance from Dutch society as predicted by the theory of immigrant occupational mobility. Most notably, Turks and Moroccans face the greatest initial dip and achieve the highest rate of adjustment, while the opposite holds for Caribbean and Western immigrants. Our results are robust to three alternative measures of occupational status. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Hunkering Down or Hunkering Away?" The Effect of Community Ethnic Diversity on Residents' Social Networks
AN  - 1448995012; 201342873
AB  - We identify two issues with the current literature suggesting that community ethnic diversity undermines social capital: (1) studies predominantly use attitudinal indicators of social capital; and (2) these attitudinal indicators are neighbourhood specific. We suggest the "size" of, and "frequency of interaction" within, individuals' social networks form more valid indicators of social capital. Thus it remains unknown: (1) whether diversity undermines individuals' social connectivity or only attitudes towards neighbours; or (2) whether diversity undermines individuals' total levels of social connectivity or only neighbourhood connectivity. We demonstrate that diversity negatively predicts both local trust and local social connectivity. However, diversity does not negatively predict individuals' total levels of connectivity. From a social connectivity perspective, diversity may undermine local social capital yet exert little effect on individuals' total levels of social capital. Instead, individuals in diverse communities possess equally sized (and active) but less neighbourhood-centric networks. However, this appears dependent on the ability to maintain dispersed social networks: less mobile individuals (e.g. the elderly) report both lower local and lower total social capital in diverse communities.

T1  - A time to make (and lose) friends: effects of soccer tournaments on German adolescents' attitudes toward foreigners
AN  - 1433108426
AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

T1  - Signal Detection Analysis of Factors Associated With Diabetes Among Semirural Mexican American Adults
AN  - 1429629012; 201338364
AB  - Signal detection analysis was used to evaluate a combination of sociodemographic, acculturation, mental health, health care, and chronic disease risk factors potentially associated with diabetes in a sample of 4,505 semirural Mexican American adults. Overall, 8.9% of adults had been diagnosed with diabetes. The analysis resulted in 12 mutually exclusive groups, with diabetes prevalence ranging from 1.8% to 44.1%. Three groups were at the highest risk (34.5%-44.1% diabetic) and accounted for almost half of those with diabetes. Each of these groups was distinguished by their middle to older ages and presence of one or more chronic conditions (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and/or poor mental health) in addition to diabetes. The differing composition of the groups identified by the signal detection analysis has important implications for the design and implementation of public health interventions and health care treatment programs for Mexican Americans with diabetes.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Practitioner and Client Explanations for Disparities in Health Care Use Between Migrant and Non-migrant Groups in Sweden: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 1478096510; 22323124
AB  - To investigate variations in explanations given for disparities in health care use between migrant and non-migrant groups, by clients and care providers in Sweden. Qualitative evidence collected during in-depth interviews with five 'migrant' health service clients and five physicians. The interview data generated three categories which were perceived by respondents to produce ethnic differences in health service use: "Communication issues", "Cultural differences in approaches to medical consultations" and "Effects of perceptions of inequalities in care quality and discrimination". Explanations for disparities in health care use in Sweden can be categorized into those reflecting social/structural conditions and the presence/absence of power and those using cultural/behavioural explanations. The negative perceptions of 'migrant' clients held by some Swedish physicians place the onus for addressing their poor health with the clients themselves and risks perpetuating their health disadvantage. The power disparity between doctors and 'migrant' patients encourages a sense of powerlessness and mistreatment among patients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Beyond insiders and outsiders: welfare and immigration reforms in 1960s US
AN  - 1792349410
AB  - Both welfare and immigration policies sort, monitor and handle people, but each targets a different population. Whereas welfare policies address those who reside within national borders, immigration policies address those who originate outside of them. What, if any, is the logic underlying the relationship between welfare and immigration policies? A growing interest in this subject in Europe postulates that states with generous welfare policies execute restrictive immigration policies, while states with limited welfare policies are relatively open to outsiders. Plausible as this explanatory logic sounds, it does not resonate with the main currents of the 1960s in the US, in which both welfare and immigration policies witnessed far-reaching expansions (The War on Poverty of 1964 and the Immigration Act of 1965). Using official archival material and secondary sources, I argue that welfare and immigration during the 1960s were indirectly linked through the Civil Rights discourse of the time. A growing awareness of racial discrimination was one of the main reasons for the War on Poverty, but it never became a legitimate rationale for addressing poverty in the 1960s. In immigration, on the other hand, racial discrimination provided the main discursive frame for abolishing the quota system. Civil Rights discourse at the time was thus more dominant in the process of homogenizing distinctions between whites from diverse ethnic and national origins than in addressing the correlation between race and poverty. This case both calls into question the argument that immigration policy depends on welfare policy and demonstrates that welfare recipients and immigrants do not constitute a homogenized social category. Instead, it shows that in the welfare-immigration equation social distinctions between citizens can be more important than distinctions between citizens and outsiders.

T1  - INTRODUCTION: ELECTION PROCESSES, POLITICS, AND GOVERNANCE IN THE OBAMA ERA
AN  - 1512220551; 201408750
AB  - In the election of 2008, Barack Obama became the first nonwhite to be elected to the US Presidency. Mr. Obama was elected with the help of a coalition of minority groups which included the support of over 95% of African-Americans who voted and a majority youth and women. The re-election of Barack Obama in 2012 highlights the rapid pace at which we have seen the terms, expressions, perceptions, and behaviors of politics and governance redefined during the 'Obama Era' affecting the dynamics of race, gender, and class. This current special edition includes articles that clearly show that since the election of President Obama, we have witnessed a significant increase in the nature and number of controversies permeating every aspect of race, gender, and class in government and politics.

T1  - Leadership as an emergent group process: A social network study of personality and leadership
AN  - 1347783707; 201318355
AB  - A longitudinal study was conducted on the social network of a leaderless group to explore how Big Five personality traits affect leadership emergence, in the form of receiver ties (being nominated as a leader), sender ties (nominating others as leaders), and similarity effects (nominating similar/different others as leaders). Forty one students on a 3-month study abroad program participated in intensive group work, and their perceptions of emergent task- and relationship-oriented leadership within these groups were assessed three times across the life cycle of the group. Results indicated that individuals scoring higher on extraversion, openness to experience, and conscientiousness were nominated more as task- and relationship-oriented leaders, whereas those who were more agreeable were more likely to emerge as relationship-oriented leaders. In terms of emergent followership, group members who were more agreeable and neurotic (and less open to experience) were less likely to follow relationship-oriented leaders, whereas more conscientious individuals were more likely to follow task-oriented leaders. With respect to the effects of complementarity and similarity, both task- and relationship-oriented leader nominations were based on dissimilar levels of agreeableness between leaders and followers, whereas nominated relationship-based leaders tended to have similar levels of openness to experience to followers. Implications of these results are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Future Directions in Research Regarding Attitudes Toward Immigrants
AN  - 1347781826; 201322207
AB  - Immigration became a political concern after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Since then, states are implementing legislation that targets immigrant groups. In response, researchers have begun to investigate the consequences of immigration policies in the United States. For this special issue of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy, the editors compiled a series of articles that highlight how the new political dynamics are influencing the lives of immigrants, often in reaction to Arizona SB 1070. This commentary summarizes the key topics discussed in the series of articles and provides suggestions for new research. It is proposed that prejudice towards immigrants is now "allowed" by the new social norms and that such prejudice produces new questions rarely addressed in the literature. The realities that some immigrants bring to the country (like reduced homicide rates) contrast the political rhetoric, and those distinctions provide great opportunities for research. In addition, the change brought about by large immigrant populations can influence self-perceptions of what many Americans consider the national identity, which is also rarely studied. This special issue provides a great step in this research endeavor, and it is proposed that there are multiple possible paths to productive research regarding prejudice towards immigrants.

T1  - Smoking, Ethnic Residential Segregation, and Ethnic Diversity: A Spatio-temporal Analysis
AN  - 1364700120; 201326631
AB  - Ethnic residential segregation is a profound social divide in many societies. In the health arena, U.S. work has been influential in demonstrating the impact of ethnic residential segregation on child health outcomes, showing how it can compound other forms of disadvantage. This article builds on and extends this research by examining the transferability of conclusions concerning the health impact of ethnic residential segregation to a non-U.S. context and to the field of health behavior. Using complete adult population data from the 1996 and 2006 New Zealand Censuses of Population geocoded to local and urban area levels, we examine smoking prevalence and cessation in relation to ethnic segregation and diversity. The article employs a repeated cross-sectional multilevel modeling strategy with smoking and cessation as outcome variables. The differential impact of segregation and diversity on smoking behavior by different ethnic groups is considered, taking into account the confounding effect of socioeconomic status and demographic variation. Conclusions suggest that Maori isolation has little overall effect but ethnic diversity has some relevance. Individual ethnic status and area-level deprivation are more important in understanding smoking behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Making contact. Generating interethnic contact for multicultural integration and tolerance in Amsterdam
AN  - 1322718506; 201312378
AB  - Interethnic contact is considered a potent tool for the generation of interethnic understanding and tolerance. This faith has engendered countless social projects that seek to stimulate contact between members of different ethnic groups under 'optimal conditions'. However, the academic literature does not stipulate how, if at all, these optimal conditions can be realized in real world interventions. This article investigates how the organizers of a number of Dutch projects for 'contact under optimal conditions' conceived of such contact and how these conceptualisations informed how projects were set up, executed and experienced. The analysis demonstrates that organizers conceived of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' as a natural autonomous process. Optimal conditions for this natural process were assumed to be guaranteed when project workers interfered as little as possible with the contact between participants. The 'natural' processes thus engendered were assumed to lead to the recognition of fundamental sameness between two ethnic groups and/or the recognition of the superficiality of their differences. In practice, however, projects were set up in ways that privileged the exchange of uncontroversial information on personal tastes and ethnic differences. Moreover, the emphasis on the dual recognition of fundamental sameness and superficial difference produced a discursive context in which the exploration of conflicts of interest was foreclosed. These results suggest that the notion of 'interethnic contact under optimal conditions' may in practice have connotations that lead to practices that reinforce, rather than challenge, existing prejudices and misunderstandings.

T1  - Discrimination, Family Relationships, and Major Depression Among Asian Americans
AN  - 1010078718; 22083344
AB  - Depression represents a growing concern among Asian Americans. This study examined whether discrimination and family dynamics are associated with depression in this population. Weighted logistic regressions using nationally representative data on Asian American adults (N = 2095) were used to examine associations between discrimination, negative interactions with relatives, family support, and 12-month major depressive disorder (MDD). Discrimination (odds ratio [OR] = 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.67, 2.71) and negative interactions with relatives (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.58) were positively associated with MDD. Family support was associated with lower MDD (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.59, 0.89), and buffered lower levels of discrimination. Results suggest that discrimination may have negative mental health implications, and also point to the importance of family relationships for depression among Asian Americans. Findings suggest that providers may consider stress experienced at multiple ecological levels to address Asian American mental health needs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Goal commitment and alignment of personal goals predict group identification only when the goals are shared
AN  - 1023026828; 201223710
AB  - Selfish pursuits of personal goals in group contexts may conflict with the group goal. Drawing on the shared reality theory and the intersubjective consensus approach to cultural dynamics, however, we propose that commitment to personal goals would be accompanied by greater group identification when individual group members realize that their personal goals are widely shared in the group. In one experiment (Study 1), we manipulated perceived sharedness of personal goals and found that commitment to personal goals correlated positively with group identification only when participants learned that their goals were shared. Subsequent surveys that incorporated a 3-month longitudinal design (Studies 2 and 3) further confirmed that goal commitment and alignment with personal goals predicted group identification only when the goals were shared in the group.

T1  - The Electoral Consequences of Skin Color: The "Hidden" Side of Race in Politics
AN  - 1315602296; 201307739
AB  - Despite the significant role that skin color plays in material well-being and social perceptions, scholars know little if anything about whether skin color and afrocentric features influence political cognition and behavior and specifically, if intraracial variation in addition to categorical difference affects the choices of voters. Do more phenotypically black minorities suffer an electoral penalty as they do in most aspects of life? This study investigates the impact of color and phenotypically black facial features on candidate evaluation, using a nationally representative survey experiment of over 2000 whites. Subjects were randomly assigned to campaign literature of two opposing candidates, in which the race, skin color and features, and issue stance of candidates was varied. I find that afrocentric phenotype is an important, albeit hidden, form of bias in racial attitudes and that the importance of race on candidate evaluation depends largely on skin color and afrocentric features. However, like other racial cues, color and black phenotype don't influence voters' evaluations uniformly but vary in magnitude and direction across the gender and partisan makeup of the electorate in theoretically explicable ways. Ultimately, I argue, scholars of race politics, implicit racial bias, and minority candidates are missing an important aspect of racial bias. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Commodifying migration: excluding migrants in Europe's emerging social model
AN  - 1081868692; 201235361
AB  - Modes of social inclusion and the dominant ways of perceiving related issues of social justice are in a state of transformation in contemporary Western societies. Traditional features of the European social model are called into question by a neoliberal logic that favours market solutions to manage social inclusion. As Yasemin Soysal convincingly argues, this transformation affects the very core of citizenship rights which in the postwar perspective of TH Marshall, were meant to promote a more cohesive and just society. Soysal claims that in the current neoliberal climate, social policies are guided by the principle of 'individuality' (understood as the imperative to 'invest' into individuals' marketable capabilities) rather than the traditional notion of redistributive social justice. According to her interpretation, the nascent social model in Europe paves the way for the gradual withering away of rights of citizens as primarily granted through the status of communal membership. Built on this diagnosis, Soysal's article poses the question regarding how this transformation affects migrants. Already under regular circumstances, migration is associated with a heightened sense of uncertainty especially within the labour market: Moving from one country to another often constitutes challenges pertaining to the recognition of qualifications, learning the codes of the labour market, finding a new supportive social network, etc. In hindsight, one could argue that the relatively robust welfare state and low levels of unemployment in the 1960s-70 period were instrumental in promoting the social inclusion of the postwar 'guest worker' migrants. And beyond relatively generous social policies at the time, work-based forms of (union-supported) solidarity helped to link the demand for successful social inclusion and citizens' rights to the regulative idea of redistributive social justice. Yet, this situation has changed dramatically: Manifestly, the neoliberal adjustment of labour market relations and social policy perspectives has called into question this traditional mode of inclusion. In particular the less privileged migrants are extremely vulnerable to the imponderability of the increasingly deregulated labour market and the gradually eroding social safety net in Europe. Yet, in this commentary, I propose that Soysal in her analysis of the distinct status of migrants in Europe, could have been more explicit about the implications of Europe's new 'social project'. I will argue that migrants are not simply exposed to this project's endemic forms of social exclusion and inequality in a more pronounced way than most other groups in society. Beyond this new sense of socio-economic vulnerability, we witness a far-reaching shift in the discursive representation of migration that is likely to have a critical impact on the politics and policies of migration. In my view, Soysal's succinct account of how the transformation of rights and obligations contributes to the reproduction of social inequalities could have benefited from acknowledging how migrants' struggle for justice is also intimately linked to struggles over recognition and symbolic inclusion. In this respect the neoliberal discursive paradigm has a profound impact on the socially dominant perception of migrants and their sense of entitlement as newcomers. In a second step, I will critically discuss Soysal's claim regarding the steady erosion of migrants' rights at the national level which could be counterbalanced by a new set of international, EU-sanctioned rights and social privileges.

T1  - Before Crisis: Gender and Economic Outcomes of the Two Largest Immigrant Communities in Spain
AN  - 1037877756; 201231007
AB  - In this study, we compare labor force outcomes of the two largest immigrant communities in Spain (Moroccans and Romanians) before the economic crisis hit. We are interested in understanding if and how gender influences the labor force outcomes (wage per hour, labor force participation, and unemployment rate) of these two immigrant groups. Our analyses show that, overall, gender is an important variable on Spanish labor market, but it affects differently the two groups. There is a male job market and a female job market for both Romanian and Moroccan immigrants, with men earning significantly higher wages than women. However, while for Moroccans, working women differ significantly from men in terms of demographic characteristics, Romanian women and men have similar demographic characteristics and comparable levels of labor force participation, but differ in terms of wage levels.

T1  - African Americans respond to stigmatization: the meanings and salience of confronting, deflecting conflict, educating the ignorant and "managing the self"
AN  - 1037875998; 201231061
AB  - Drawing on interviews with 150 randomly sampled African Americans, we analyse how members of a stigmatized group understand their experience of stigmatization and assess appropriate responses when asked about the best approach to deal with stigmatization and about responses to specific incidents. Combining in-depth interviews with a systematic coding of the data, we make original contributions to the previous literature by identifying the relative salience of modalities and tools for responding. We also examine closely through qualitative data the two most salient modalities of response, 'confronting' and 'deflating' conflict, the most salient tools, teaching out-group members about African Americans, and 'the management of the self', a rationale for deflating conflict that is largely overlooked in previous studies. We find that 'confronting' is the more popular modality for responding to stigmatization among African Americans. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ordinary people doing extraordinary things: responses to stigmatization in comparative perspective
AN  - 1037875975; 201231111
AB  - This special issue offers a first systematic qualitative cross-national exploration of how diverse minority groups respond to stigmatization in a wide variety of contexts. This research is the culmination of a coordinated study of stigmatized groups in Brazil, Israel and the USA, as well as of connected research projects conducted in Canada, France, South Africa and Sweden. The issue sheds light on the range of destigmatization strategies ordinary people adopt in the course of their daily life. Articles analyse the cultural frames they mobilize to make sense of their experiences and to determine how to respond; how they negotiate and transform social and symbolic boundaries; and how responses are enabled and constrained by institutions, national ideologies, cultural repertoires and contexts. The similarities and differences across sites provide points of departure for further systematic research, which is particularly needed in light of the challenges for liberal democracy raised by multiculturalism.

T1  - White cruelty or Republican sins? Competing frames of stigma reversal in French commemorations of slavery
AN  - 1037875371; 201231060
AB  - This paper explores how French activists use claims about the history and legacies of slavery to combat stigmas associated with their group membership. Using a case study of a French Caribbean association (CM98) and a pan-African association (COFFAD), I examine how two organizations produce competing models for challenging and reversing the stigma of slavery. Through a process of normative inversion, activists assert the moral inferiority of dominant groups. CM98 rejects both a racial and an African identity, and seeks recognition for 'French descendants of slaves', using the language of citizenship to criticize the French government. COFFAD, by contrast, asserts an Afro-centric black identity and stigmatizes white Europeans. I argue that both destigmatization strategies unwittingly reinforce the stigma of historical enslavement.

T1  - Complement or competition: Latino employment in a nontraditional settlement area
AN  - 1429627910; 201335833
AB  - The migration of Latinos to nontraditional settlement areas in the United States is renewing interest in how an established low-skilled work force is affected by the inflow of a minority group whose members tend to have a weak basket of human capital. Some scholars focus on how the incoming group creates head-to-head competition with established workers. An alternative view posits that, depending on the context of the receiving labor market, incoming workers may primarily fill roles that complement preexisting labor market arrangements. I study these issues in the region of the country that has experienced the most pronounced in-migration of Latinos during the past few years. The findings indicate migrating Latinos tend to complement preexisting labor market conditions rather than spark job competition and undercut the earning power of non-Latinos.

AB  - In the United States, the 2000s were marked by record numbers of immigrants and heightened levels of pro- and anti-immigrant agitation. As a result, research investigating anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and other societies has surged. In this article, the authors investigate the determinants of perceived immigrant job threat in the fifty U.S. states in 2005. They draw upon three theoretical perspectives that dominate the study of prejudice -- group threat theory, contact theory, and cultural theory -- but move beyond these established theories to adduce three new perspectives, which they label economic competition, labor market deregulation, and globalization. The authors find support for all six perspectives. The three new perspectives augment, rather than supplant, the traditional theories. The authors find that levels of perceived immigrant job threat tend to increase in settings where there is economic stagnation, where labor unions are growing weaker, where the minimum wage is low, and where corporate restructuring has taken place.

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 907928737; 201124757
AB  - Between 1901 and 1913, Norwegian women won a series of legislative victories, including the universal right to vote. To Norwegian Americans, these events held special meaning. They represented verifiable and contemporary proof of what Norwegian Americans had been arguing for some time: namely, that their homeland was a bastion of progress and democracy and that they had carried this particular legacy to the New World. Many argued that as Norwegian Americans, they were committed to modern, forward-looking ideas and democratic principles, thereby making them model citizens in their adopted home. Women's suffrage advocates also used this particular rhetorical emphasis to substantiate their claims that Norwegian Americans had a duty to support women's suffrage based on their cultural connection to progress and equality. A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the United States that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups, including the Irish and the Italians, struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the United States. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were -- as all others -- keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. An investigation into the particular case of Norwegian Americans living in Minnesota and North Dakota reveals an intriguing relationship between Norwegian American cultural arguments that asserted a common ethnic past and women's suffrage debates. This article seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the United States.

T1  - The Sword's Other Edge: Perceptions Of Discrimination And Racial Policy Opinion After Obama
AN  - 896169205; 201120530
AB  - This study explores the impact of a momentous political event, the election of the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, on perceptions of racism and opinions about racial policy. A representative panel study of Americans interviewed immediately before and after the election reveals a roughly 10 percent decline in perceptions of racial discrimination. About one quarter of respondents revised their perceptions of discrimination downward. We explore several explanations for this decline. First, motivated-reasoning theory would predict larger declines among those whose priors tell them that racism was a diminished force to begin with. Second, changes could be concentrated among those who have the least contact with out-group members, or who are less knowledgeable about politics, and therefore weight Obama's victory heavily in deciding how much racism exists in America. Third, based on theories of emotion and cognition, anxiety but not anger before the election might trigger substantial updating of beliefs. We found the drop in perceived discrimination to be widespread across groups in the population, with conservatives but not necessarily racially resentful whites exhibiting somewhat larger declines. Residential racial context had no effect on changes in perception, though declines were larger among the least politically knowledgeable. More notably, those citizens anxious but not angry before the election displayed much larger declines in perceived discrimination. Finally, declines in perceived discrimination were associated with increases in negative opinions of blacks and heightened opposition to both affirmative action and immigration.

T1  - Latinos in the US and Spain: demographics, designations and political identities
AN  - 902083206; 201122278
AB  - Hispanic, Spanish speaking or Latino residents are a strong force in international migration; the influence in the societies in which they reside is seldom questioned. This article reviews the nature of the Latino group (immigrants and native born) in two countries, Spain and the US, the names through which they are known, their countries of origin, and their individual and group identities. The strength, demographics, and political organization of their collectives are also addressed, as is the citizenship status of the members in the host society. These issues are important for social workers who need to understand the nature of modern Latino or Latin-American immigration to address services to them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Asian American-White Differences in the Effect of Motherhood on Career Outcomes
AN  - 856403221; 201106878
AB  - U.S.-born Asian Americans are unique among American minority groups in that they lack earnings disadvantages relative to Whites with similar education levels. Controlling for education and age, there is little difference in the earnings of U.S.-born Asian and White men, but Asian women have higher earnings than comparable White women. Using data from SESTAT, this study tests the hypothesis that Asian American women's high earnings may result from adjusting their labor supply less than White women in response to parenthood, leading to greater work experience over time. Findings show that Asian American women are less likely than White women to reduce labor supply in response to parenthood and that their resulting greater work experience explains their high rate of earnings growth.

T1  - The Impact of Group Entitativity on Linguistic Discrimination: Ingroup Favoritism and Outgroup Derogation in the Explanation of Negative Outcome Allocations
AN  - 964196716; 201207271
AB  - This study investigated the impact of minimal group entitativity on linguistic ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Group entitativity varied across three conditions: mere categorization, spatial separation of groups, and common fate. Participants described with spontaneous language negative outcome allocations performed either by ingroup or by outgroup members. Findings showed that linguistic discrimination was not elicited by mere categorization and occurred only in the common fate condition. Group entitativity mainly affected linguistic outgroup derogation. This study adds to the evidence of linguistic discrimination in minimal groups and shows the strength of a linguistic measure in disentangling the different components of intergroup bias.

AN  - 914766157; 201200203
AB  - Is immigrant groups' assimilation to host society at odds with their engagement with the country of ancestral origin? This study divides the concept of assimilation into socioeconomic resources and attachment to host society, and argues that assimilation and transnational perspectives are coexisting paradigms. Analyses using the nationally representative samples of Latino and Asian Americans indicate that higher-order generations reduce the odds of home country engagement, i.e., frequent return visits; attachment to American society does not discourage return visits; socioeconomic resources increase frequent visits; and the country of origin is a significant predictor of home country visits.

T1  - Success on European Labor Markets: A Cross-national Comparison of Attainment between Immigrant and Majority Populations
AN  - 1023027478; 201223945
AB  - Typical labor market outcomes vary considerably between majority and migrant populations. Drawing on scholarship from across the social sciences, we assess competing micro- and macro-level explanations of differential occupational attainment among immigrant groups across 28 countries. The analyses of occupational attainment are run separately for first- and second-generation migrants as well as children of mixed marriage and take into account their wider social and cultural background. Results from four rounds of the European Social Survey show that people with a migration background do not necessarily achieve a lower labor market success than the majority. However, human capital, social mobility, and cultural background explain these outcomes to different degrees, suggesting tailored pathways to labor market success for each group of migrants. We also find that occupational attainment varies considerably across countries, although this is hardly attributable to immigration policies. These and other findings are discussed in the light of previous studies on immigrant incorporation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tonga Orature as Historical Record: An Afrocentric Exegesis of the Dialectics Between African Human Factor Agency and the European Enslavement of Place
AN  - 835111541; 201100487
AB  - The article critically examines the history of the Tonga people's experiences of civilization and displacement from their life-affirming geographical location as enunciated through their oral forms, particularly, songs and other forms of reminiscence. The experiences of the Tonga people of Zimbabwe are largely overlooked in scholarship because they are considered one of the so-called minority groups, meriting little or no attention at all. Informed by an Afrocentric approach, in which it is 'valid to posit Africa as a geographical and cultural starting base in the study of peoples [of Africa and] of African descent,' the article brings out an understanding of African orature as a redoubtable expression of the African classical past and the subsequent subversion and decimation of African human factor agency as a result of the European enslavement of place. In this regard, the authors contend that Africologists would do well to study African people's orature, as it often reflects their story from their own perspective.

T1  - The Effects of citizenship dissimilarity and national pride on attitudes toward immigrants: Investigating mediators and moderators of intergroup contact
AN  - 822521913; 201072857
AB  - Building on research from organizational sociology and the contact hypothesis, we incorporated community characteristics to examine how coworker citizenship dissimilarity influences employees' attitudes towards immigrants. We also proposed that the nature of this relationship would depend on national pride. Results from a national survey (n = 559) indicated living with more immigrants in one's neighborhood corresponded in heightened citizenship dissimilarity at the workplace. It, in turn, corresponded in employees holding more favorable views of immigrants. This effect was the most pronounced for people with high levels of national pride because of the presumably increased opportunities to dispel their previously held negative stereotypes about out-group members.

T1  - Black Retail Enterprise And Racial Segregation In Northern Cities Before The "Ghetto"
AN  - 764417918; 201064696
AB  - Past research indicates that black entrepreneurship in northern cities was unaffected by residential segregation by race until after the formation of the "ghetto." In the present study, however, an analysis of Census data shows that in the urban North during the late nineteenth century, the residential segregation of blacks was positively associated with blacks' shopkeeping ratio, a measure of the extent to which black retail entrepreneurs were merchants rather than peddlers. This finding accords with the theory that ethnic businesses are often supported by the residential segregation of group members. Moreover, it implies that black merchants in northern cities may have been bolstered by business ownership opportunities created by a socially and spatially segregated market of black consumers much earlier than previously believed.

AB  - Racial and ethnic diversification is becoming increasingly evident in the American population and while not new, its present scope is greater in magnitude than in past eras. This diversification will likely impact, in particular, how race is conceptualized in the future and existing relations between racial and ethnic groups. A third possible impact-that American society will become post-racial-is considered and rejected because empirical evidence does not support this proposition. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives' Opinions Toward Immigration in North Carolina
AN  - 758121612; 201057035
AB  - This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - The Role of Historical Knowledge in Perception of Race-Based Conspiracies
AN  - 868013659; 201112974
AB  - We test the hypothesis that knowledge of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies affects perceived plausibility of new, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 1 (N = 78), African Americans and European Americans read about a current conspiracy aimed at undermining either African American or European American elected officials. African Americans perceived the anti-black conspiracy as more plausible and the conspiracy informant as more credible than did European Americans. The difference in perception of informant credibility was mediated by recognition of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 2, we manipulated European Americans (N = 105) exposure to information about historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. European Americans who learned about actual, past anti-black conspiracies perceived new anti-black conspiracies as more plausible than did European Americans who learned about race-silent conspiracies or who did not learn about conspiracies. To the extent that European Americans lack awareness of incidents of racism in US history, they are likely to underestimate the possibility that racism impacts contemporary events.

T1  - 'Reasonable accommodation' in Quebec: the limits of participation and dialogue
AN  - 754044619; 201053351
AB  - This article explores the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, a 2007-8 government consultation that was established in Quebec to study interculturalism, secularism and national identity, in response to what had become known as the 'reasonable accommodation debates' on the extent to which minority and immigrant cultural practices could be accommodated. The focus of this exploration is on two aspects of the Commission: the citizens' forums that were a part of its deliberative process; and the ways in which it responded to the idea of crisis. Through an analysis of aspects of the Commission's final report, the ways in which the Commission was structured and the media representations of the Commission, this article argues that, despite the spirit of equality and fairness to which the commissioners were committed and the praise it received from some members of immigrant and minority groups, the Commission ended up reinforcing the racialised hierarchies and exclusions that it wanted to redress.

T1  - Reversal of Fortunes or Continued Success? Cohort Differences in Education and Earnings of Childhood Immigrants
AN  - 754037657; 201049679
AB  - Using several years of Canadian census data, this study examines cohort differences in educational attainment and earnings among childhood immigrants who arrived in Canada between 1960 and 1989. Successive cohorts of childhood immigrants had increasingly higher university completion rates than their Canadian-born peers by age 25--34. We find that this lead was tempered by declining earnings of immigrant parents relative to Canadian-born parents, particularly among the 1980s cohort. Despite rising university completion rates, wages of male (but not female) childhood immigrants lagged behind those of their Canadian-born peers. This gap can be accounted for largely by the rising share of members of racial minority groups and the decreasing incidence of full-time employment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Health Competence As Predictor of Access to Care Among Latinos in Baltimore
AN  - 199566986; 18060500
AB  - The goal of this study is to identify the underlying structure of Health Competence and its value as a predictor of access to care among the Latino population in Baltimore, Maryland. Data on a cross-sectional urban probability sample were collected from 330 foreign-born Latino men and women aged 21-75 years residing in Baltimore at the time of the survey. Principal components analysis yielded a two-component solution: the first component comprised "factors enabling" access to care; the second, "perceived barriers". When testing the predictive power of the Health Competence construct using model building and the log likelihood criteria the "enabling factors" added significantly (P < .005) to the power of the socio-demographic variables to predict access to care, making it an important tool for programs aiming to improve US Latinos' health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Latino Employment and Residential Segregation in Metropolitan Labor Markets METROPOLITAN LABOR MARKETS
AN  - 758123158; 201056916
AB  - The spatial configuration of minorities relative to Whites in a metropolitan area, or residential segregation, has been identified as a significant barrier to access to employment opportunities for racial/ethnic minorities, including Latinos, in metropolitan labor markets. Dominating the research are tests of place stratification models that focus on segregated ethnic enclaves or the mismatch between minority communities and employment opportunities. Both approaches focus on predominantly Latino neighborhoods and communities, but overlook their structural location and isolation in the broader metropolitan labor market. This study examines whether and to what extent structural characteristics of metropolitan labor markets in which Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans live and work shape their employment opportunities and whether or not these relationships vary across the three Latino native-origin groups. We utilize a unique dataset of the demographic, employment, educational, occupational, and industrial characteristics of the 95 largest US cities. The analyses feature both OLS regression to ascertain if varying levels of segregation across metropolitan areas in 2000 is associated with different levels of employment for Latinos, and a fixed-effects analysis to determine if changes in these structural factors between 1980 and 2000 within the same labor market affect the employment rates of Latinos in that metropolitan area. We find that segregation has a deleterious effect on Latino men's employment; in cities where segregation is worse, their employment rates are lower, and as the cities that they live in became more segregated over the 20 year period of study, their employment rates decreased.

T1  - Voting across ethnic lines in late Imperial Austria
AN  - 60365265; 201019012
AB  - ABSTRACT. The Austrian party system, following the introduction of universal manhood suffrage in 1907, has conventionally been characterised as being divided along ethno-national lines, reinforcing perceptions that politics within the Habsburg Empire was overwhelmingly driven by nationalism. However, the electoral results in a number of districts only make sense if one assumes that voters cast ballots for their alleged ethnic opponents. A systematic analysis of election results, utilising a simple process of elimination and drawing on the highly detailed statistical records available, strongly suggests that such voting was commonplace. Furthermore, alternative explanations based on differential voting qualification rates, errors in the census, and electoral fraud do not withstand close scrutiny. One must therefore conclude that although ethnic conflict did occur, it was paralleled by inter-ethnic bargaining and compromise, thereby supporting more positive appraisals of Austrian electoral and parliamentary politics and of representative political institutions in ethnically divided societies.

T1  - Discussing Depression with Vietnamese American Patients
AN  - 199541243; 19242803
AB  - Asian patients preferentially seek mental health care from their primary care providers but are unlikely to receive it. Primary care providers need culturally-informed strategies for addressing stigmatizing illnesses. Eleven Vietnamese American community members participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. The grounded theory approach was used for qualitative coding and thematic analysis. Vietnamese community members describe experiences with depression under four themes: 1. stigma and face, 2. social functioning and the role of the family, 3. traditional healing and beliefs about medications and 4. language and culture. Based on this data, we offer suggestions for improving culturally-informed care for Vietnamese Americans. Our study adds to the research aimed at improving communication and health care relationships between physicians and Vietnamese American patients. Physicians should learn to tailor their interviewing style to the increasingly diverse patient population.

T1  - Do People Who Like Diversity Practice Diversity in Neighbourhood Life? Neighbourhood Use and the Social Networks of 'Diversity-Seekers' in a Mixed Neighbourhood in the Netherlands
AN  - 60361345; 201011834
AB  - Urban policies in various countries aim at integrating minorities into mainstream society through combating residential segregation. One strategy is to change the housing stock. Assuming that the middle classes leave certain neighbourhoods because they lack suitable dwellings, building more expensive dwellings is an important policy trajectory in the Netherlands. However, living in the proximity of other income groups is in itself insufficient to overcome racial, ethnic and class divides in social networks. The usual policy indicator for defining 'middle class', e.g. income, is not a very good predictor for the diversity of networks of people living in mixed neighbourhoods. What, then, is? The first step is to ask what distinguishes people who prefer diverse neighbourhoods. Are people who are attracted by the diversity of an area different from others? Next, we question whether people who like diversity have more diversity in their networks or contribute in other ways to a more integrated neighbourhood through their use of it. We use social network data collected in a mixed inner-city neighbourhood in Rotterdam to explore this. We argue that attracting people to an area because of its diversity may contribute to the economic viability of local businesses and possibly to the nature of interactions in public space. However, we can not empirically substantiate that a preference for a diverse neighbourhood translates into distinct practices or social networks that enhance the integration of ethnic minorities into mainstream society.
