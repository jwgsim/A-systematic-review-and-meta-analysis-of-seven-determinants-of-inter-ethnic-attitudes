T1  - Threatened Masculinity: Gender-Related Collective Narcissism Predicts Prejudice Toward Gay and Lesbian People among Heterosexual Men in Poland
AN  - 2649160197
AB  - We examined the relationships between different types of in-group positivity and prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men. We assumed that prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men should be predicted by gender-related collective narcissism (i.e., an unrealistic belief about in-group’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and extremely sensitive to any signs of threats) and not secure gender in-group identification (i.e., a confidently held in-group evaluation which is independent of the recognition of the group by others and serves as a buffer against threats). Across two studies (final Ns = 212 and 180) we found that gender-related collective narcissism (but not secure gender in-group identification or gender self-esteem) is positively related to prejudice toward gay and lesbian people among heterosexual men. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that this relationship was largely accounted for by the perceived out-group threat.

T1  - This Land Is (Not) Your Land: Race and Ascripted Americanness in the Formation of Attitudes about Immigrants
AN  - 2627320351
AB  - Race consistently patterns anti-immigrant bias. However, it is less clear if all racial groups define “being American” in the same way. This work explores the ways ascribed characteristics that define being “American,” termed Ascripted Americanness, potentially contributes to racial variation in attitudes toward immigrants. Using the 2004 & 2014 General Social Survey (n = 1,774), results show that emphasizing any facet of Ascripted Americanness, particularly US ancestry, correlates to anti-immigrant hostility. Furthermore, the connection between Ascripted Americanness and hostility tends to be more pronounced for white adults compared to black or Latinx adults. Ultimately, these findings reveal that hostility toward immigrants is shaped by the racialization of symbolic boundaries around “being American.”

T1  - The Rise and Fall of Japan’s New Far Right: How Anti-Korean Discourses Went Mainstream*
AN  - 2557394767
AB  - Why has right-wing activism in Japan, despite its persistence throughout the postwar era, only gained significant traction recently? Focusing on the Zaitokukai, an anti-Korean movement in Japan, this article demonstrates how the new Far Right were able to popularize formerly stigmatized right-wing ideas. The Zaitokukai represents a political group distinct from the traditional right and reflective of new Far Right movements spreading worldwide. In Japan, concerns about the growing influence of South Korea and China in the 1980s as well as the decline of left-wing norms opened up a discursive opportunity for the new Far Right. By framing Korean postcolonial minorities as undeserving recipients of social welfare benefits, the Zaitokukai mobilized perceptions of threat that has continued to powerfully influence public perceptions of Koreans even following the group’s organizational decline. While past research has focused on the new Far Right’s political influence, this article stresses their roles as ideological entrepreneurs.

T1  - Possibilities for the incorporation of African indigenous procedures and mechanisms of dispute resolution in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria
AN  - 2462971230
AB  - The pre-colonial African communities were ethnically and culturally diverse with no single dominant ethnic and religious group. Unwritten customary law and procedures were the means by which local communities resolved disputes in the absence of state authority. The laws were based on a common cultural belief and ethical codes that generate a binding regulation on members. Communities adopted this model to impose sanctions against violators and resolve disputes arising among members through various mechanisms. However, the introduction of a new justice system by the colonialists completely interrupted the indigenous system. Today, the indigenous justice system in many African countries is restricted to handling only civil matters through the application of ADR to address some of the challenges facing the contemporary justice system. This paper argues that the customary justice procedure can be adopted in criminal matters as a model that seeks to understand and address the realities of the social causes of crime. The paper concludes that the two systems of justice can complement each other to restore public confidence in the system by catering for the loss suffered by victims rather than focusing on the offenders and offence, bringing justice closer to people without any stress, reintegrating offenders back into the society and ensuring social harmony.

T1  - Making community under shared conditions of insecurity: the negotiation of ethnic borders in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile
AN  - 2430674544
AB  - Multicultural commercial neighbourhoods are key spaces where individuals learn to relate to cultural difference in increasingly diverse cities worldwide. Host countries’ pre-existing social dynamics and environmental conditions mutually shape everyday interactions between people from different ethnonational backgrounds within specific spaces. This article examines two kinds of community-making practices consisting of both intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic exchanges and collaborations, under conditions of shared insecurity in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile. Drawing on ethnic Chinese experiences and responses to crime, we discuss how inhabitants of multicultural sites create more hospitable spaces by building and overcoming boundaries with co-ethnics, other migrants and ‘locals’. Our ethnographic study finds that Chinese residents engaged in what we term ‘strategic ethnic groupism’, which aims to prompt the solidarity of an ‘ethnic-based’ collective in order to politically organise towards long-term solutions. Yet, simultaneously, with other migrants and citizens, the Chinese negotiated everyday intercultural conviviality through creating relations of trust and care to address more immediate insecurity concerns. Discussing both strategies, this article contributes to understanding the productive frictions between ethnicity, community and belonging, under shared conditions of insecurity, in multicultural urban spaces.

T1  - Identity, Couple and Intergroup Dynamics in Intercultural Families: Implications on Life Satisfaction of Partners
AN  - 2410525166
AB  - The current study analyzed how identity, couple, and intergroup dynamics are related to life satisfaction among 210 intercultural partners living in Italy. Three levels of analysis were considered: a micro level, taking into account the identity aspect of each partner in terms of self‐ or hetero‐ethnic identification; a meso level, examining the passion, commitment, and intimacy of the couple sphere of the partners; a macro level investigating the discrimination that partners can perceive by the community as an effect of the relationship between dominant and minority groups. The results show that for both partners, foreign and Italian, the variables that have a predictive value on life satisfaction bring into play the couple and the intergroup dynamics, leaving out the identitary one. Specifically, increased perceived discrimination as a member of a mixed couple leads to decreased life satisfaction by partners. In turn, we can see that a strong intimacy between partners enhances their life satisfaction. These results introduce a reflection on the role of the differences about the ethnic identity, considered erroneously the main cause of dissatisfaction in the mixed couple. The implications of the study are described and suggestions for future research discussed.Alternate abstract:El presente estudio analizó cómo la dinámica de la identidad, de la pareja e intergrupal está relacionada con la satisfacción con la vida entre 210 integrantes de parejas interculturales que viven en Italia. Se consideraron tres niveles de análisis: un nivel micro, que tiene en cuenta el aspecto de la identidad de cada integrante de la pareja en cuanto a la autoidentificación étnica o la héteroidentificación étnica; un nivel meso, que analiza la pasión, el compromiso y la intimidad en el ámbito de pareja de los integrantes de la pareja; un nivel macro que investiga la discriminación que los integrantes de la pareja pueden percibir de la comunidad como consecuencia de la relación entre grupos dominantes y minoritarios. Los resultados demuestran que para ambos integrantes de la pareja, extranjero e italiano, las variables que tienen un valor predictivo sobre la satisfacción con la vida ponen en juego la dinámica de pareja e intergrupal, excluyendo la de identidad. Específicamente, una mayor discriminación percibida como integrante de una pareja interracial conduce a una menor satisfacción con la vida por parte de los integrantes de la pareja. A su vez, podemos obsevar que una intimidad profunda entre los integrantes de la pareja mejora su satisfacción con la vida. Estos resultados presentan una reflexión sobre el papel que juegan las diferencias con respecto a la identidad étnica, considerada erróneamente la causa principal de insatisfacción en la pareja interracial. Se describen las implicancias del estudio y se debaten sugerencias para investigaciones futuras.Alternate abstract:本研究针对生活在意大利的210对跨文化的伴侣,考察了身份,双方互动和族群之间的互动对生活满意度的影响。一共进行了三个层面的分析:微观层面的,考虑到每个伴侣的身份,自我认同,和异性恋认同;中间层面考察热情,效忠度,伴侣之间的亲密程度;宏观层面考察对伴侣的歧视,通过主流族裔和少数族裔的关系的效果来看伴侣所在的社群。结果显示,对伴侣双方,不管来自意大利国之外的和意大利的,这些变量对生活的满意度有一个预测作用, 他们对伴侣之间的互动和族群之间的互动会起作用,除了身份那个。具体而言就是可观察到的歧视情况越多,一对跨国伴侣就会因为对方的行为而降低生活的满意度。与之相反,如果伴侣之间的亲密程度高,生活的满意度也会高。这些结果可以引导对种族身份的差异所起作用进行反思,以及它被错误地认为是在跨国伴侣中的不满意的主要成因。本研究的暗含意义和对未来研究的建议都有讨论。.

T1  - Class Background, Reception Context, and Intergenerational Mobility: A Record Linkage and Surname Analysis of the Children of Irish Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 2369764507
AB  - Proponents of restrictive immigration policies often claim that families arriving with fewer skills and resources will struggle economically. This claim is challenging to test as lower-skilled migrants also tend to face greater discrimination, exclusion, and obstacles in the United States. I use unique multigenerational data on Irish Americans in the early-twentieth century, before and after migration, to directly study how the economic origins of Irish families and the reception context they faced in the United States affected economic attainment in the second generation. This analysis finds weak associations between economic background in Ireland and second-generation earnings in the United States. The schooling context and ethnic communities of settlement locations in the United States, in contrast, have strong effects on the second generation. These findings indicate that the experiences of immigrant families in the United States may be more important for second-generation attainment than the skills and resources brought from the origin country in the immigrant generation.

T1  - Construing the Essence: The Effects of Construal Level on Genetic Attributions for Individual and Social Group Differences
AN  - 2082931262
AB  - The present research links a nonsocial, contextual influence (construal level) to the tendency to endorse genetic attributions for individual and social group differences. Studies 1 to 3 show that people thinking in an abstract (vs. concrete) mind-set score higher on a measure of genetic attributions for individual and racial group differences. Study 4 showed that abstract (vs. concrete) construal also increased genetic attributions for novel groups. Study 5 explored the potential downstream consequences of construal on intergroup attitudes, and found that abstract (vs. concrete) construal led people to endorse genetic attributions in general and this was associated with increased anti-Black prejudice.

T1  - On the Structure of Subalternity and the Process of Subalternisation in India
AN  - 1941602286
AB  - The concept of subalternity, originally formulated by the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, was amplified by a few Indian historians by juxtaposing the elitist nationalist historiography with subaltern historiography providing a bottom-up perspective. This paper attempts to identify the structure of subaltern deprivations with special reference to India. The main sources of subalternisation in India are as follows: treating some groups/communities as outsiders to the polity (externalisation); assigning groups to the lowest rung of the social ladder (hierarchisation); denial of identity to some groups through a process of absorption (expansionism of the hegemonic group) and lastly, application of traditional norms of society to keep women in subordination (patriarchy). The groups/communities subjected to the process of subalternisation in contemporary India are dalits, adivasis, religious and linguistic minorities and women. Admittedly, the phenomenon of intersectionality creates a hierarchy among subaltern groups--some are cumulatively oppressed, based on several factors, while the oppression of others is anchored in one or two factors only.

T1  - Exploring the Mother-Adolescent Relationship as a Promotive Resource for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth
AN  - 1940969148
AB  - Research often analyzes gender minority youth and sexual minority youth as a single group, a practice that obscures differences in how gender identity and sexual orientation shape health. The present study uses intersectionality to explore similarities and differences in the relationships between minority stress theory variables in a sample of 28 gender minority and 135 sexual minority youth of color. We also explore the mother-adolescent relationship as a potential promotive resource for minority stress research with youth. Results find few differences in minority stressors, promotive resources, or health between sexual and gender minority youth. However, different patterns in the correlations between stressors, resources, and health were observed for each group, underscoring the need for researchers to consider sexual and gender minority youth as distinct groups. Furthermore, study findings suggest that the maternal relationship may be an important promotive resource for both sexual and gender minority youth.

T1  - College Students, Sexualities Identities, and Participation in Political Marches
AN  - 1883505337
AB  - Student protest is often an engine of social change for sexual minorities and other oppressed groups. Through an analysis of college students in the Add Health survey (n=2,534), we found that sexual minorities attend more political marches than heterosexuals. To understand why this sexuality difference occurs, we performed a logistic regression analysis to decipher the importance of four explanations: essentialism, selection, embeddedness, and conversion. We discovered that participation in political groups is the best explanation of the sexuality gap in activism, but racial attitudes were also important. Type of college major was generally connected to student activism, but educational attainment and disciplinary curriculums did not explain the increased activism of sexual minorities.

T1  - Through the Looking Glass: White First-year University Students' Observations of Racism in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada
AN  - 1888628531
AB  - Despite the growing interest in microaggression theory (Sue et al. ), little research has been conducted on it through a sociological lens. In fact, the psychological research that does exist has been from the United States (Constantine ; Mercer et al. ; Ong et al. ; Sue et al. ) and Canada (Hernandez ; Houshmand ), focusing primarily on minorities. One area that remains unexplored is white observations of racism. This is especially relevant given that Sue et al. contend that it is those who are most disempowered rather than those who enjoy the privileges of power who are likely to accurately assess whether a racist act has occurred. With this view in mind, this article utilizes racial microaggression theory to investigate the observations of racism among a cohort of approximately 170 white freshman (i.e., first-year) university students in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. As this research is Canadian based, it presents an excellent opportunity to advance racial microaggression theory from an international perspective. The goal of this article then is to categorize white youths' observations of microaggressions in order to discuss and analyze their impact on minorities living in a highly homogeneous, white-dominated space.

T1  - Introduction: Religion and public life
AN  - 1891806457
AB  - Political debate about the place of religion and religious identities in liberal democracies is as vigorous as ever, as evidenced by Christians' assertiveness against what they regard as secularising tendencies and the attempt to eliminate their established place in public life, as well as religious minorities seeking to combat their often marginalised position and the specific injustices to which they are subject (such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia). The papers in this collection aim to address these and similar issues, and to offer novel and fresh perspectives on some of the key themes and debates on religion and public life in contemporary political theory. In this introductory essay, we illustrate, first, the key elements of four contemporary debates on religion and public life which are explored in the articles that follow. These are the conflict between secularism and religious establishment, public reason and the use of religious arguments in public deliberation, the accommodation of religious beliefs, and the relationship between freedom of speech and religion. After surveying these debates we end with an overview of the essays in this special issue.

T1  - The Impact of Adolescents' Classroom and Neighborhood Ethnic Diversity on Same- and Cross-Ethnic Friendships Within Classrooms
AN  - 1871510067
AB  - This study examines how classroom and neighborhood ethnic diversity affect adolescents' tendency to form same- versus cross-ethnic friendships when they enter middle school. Hypotheses are derived from exposure, conflict, and constrict theory. Hypotheses are tested among 911 middle school students (43 classrooms, nine schools) in the Netherlands. Multilevel (p2) social network analyses show that students were more likely to engage in same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friendships. In line with conflict theory, greater classroom and neighborhood diversity were related to stronger tendencies to choose same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friends, among both ethnic majority and minority students. Diversity did not hamper reciprocity, as students in more ethnically diverse classrooms were even more likely to reciprocate friendships.

T1  - From diversity to conviviality: intra-EU mobility and international migration to Denmark in times of economic recession
AN  - 1869136048
AB  - This article explores differences among EU and non-EU migrants in accommodating to the Danish flexicurity labour and welfare regime during times of economic crisis. We build our findings on a quantitative survey followed by semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with EU and non-EU migrants who moved to Denmark during the recession period (2008-2013). We argue that the lack of multicultural policies triggers individualised strategies of accommodation rather than ethnic or national group base integration, favouring a more homogenous group of high-skilled and educated group of workers and students of postgraduate/higher education, whom we describe as a 'flexicurity diversity group'. Through patterns of conviviality, individual socialisation is based here on common interests, needs and lifestyles and not on pre-defined ethnic and/or cultural traits. The transition from diversity to conviviality that is initiated by this group remains however incomplete in light of the unequal opportunities and the differentiated scheme of rights that apply to EU and non-EU immigrants. Danish flexicurity has thus not had the desired inclusive effects but discriminates in terms of facilitating easy access to the labour market for all, and 'securing' social benefits and offering rights and protection only to the privileged group of EU migrants.

T1  - Animosities in Yugoslavia before its demise: Revelations of an opinion poll survey
AN  - 1840582267
AB  - Contrary to the widespread opinion that hatred and mutual dislike among various ethnic groups was a chief characteristic of Yugoslavia and was at the bottom of the country's destruction, the ethnic distance survey conducted in 1990 indicates that Yugoslav society was a community with a generally low level of ethnic animosities. The results demonstrate the huge discrepancy between what most Yugoslav citizens felt and needed, and what political elites and nationalist intellectuals claimed "their people" wanted and needed in the 1990s. Many scholars have not incorporated or noticed the difference.

T1  - The Politics of Walmart Moms: Parenthood and Political Attitudes in the 2012 Election
AN  - 1843964433
AB  - This research uses 2012 National Election Studies data to explore how parenthood shapes the public opinion of women and men. Our analyses show that being a parent shapes attitudes on issues directly connected to children, such as government funding for education and day care, but also on issues less connected to the day-to-day activities of parenting, including the appropriate role of government and abortion. While the label "Walmart Mom" captures the reality that a large and growing number of mothers are struggling economically, the effect of motherhood, on most issues, holds for all women, regardless of socioeconomic status. This article discusses the implications of our findings concerning the politics of motherhood and fatherhood in light of the changing structure of America's families.

T1  - Towards empirical comparison of immigrant integration across nations
AN  - 1817595765
AB  - The ambitious attempt by Richard Alba and Nancy Foner to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of immigrant integration across several immigration nations - namely the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands - concludes that low-status immigrant groups are marginal across all of these countries, and overall none of them stands out as particularly positive or negative. At the same time, some countries perform better than others on specific dimensions of integration, offset by less-favourable results on others. Dimensions examined include employment and economic mobility, overall economic well-being, residential inclusion, overcoming marginality based on race and religion, access to citizenship and political power, education for the children of immigrants, inter-group marriages and identification with the national society. The complexity of the analysis is daunting, and troubled in some aspects by empirical and methodological issues. The effort nonetheless moves the field forward substantially, and defines a new agenda for future research.

T1  - Who do migrant associations represent? The role of 'ethnic deservingness' and legal capital in migrants' rights claims in Turkey
AN  - 1814221847
AB  - Considering that established migrant associations often play an active role in migrants' rights advocacy, the relationship between them and the growing numbers of irregular migrants needs careful scrutiny. Looking at the encounters between irregular Bulgarian Turkish migrants and associations established by their co-ethnics who hold Turkish citizenship in Turkey, our ethnographic evidence shows that co-ethnic migrant associations mobilise the legal frame of 'ethnic deservingness' with the intention of welcoming co-ethnics to the Turkish homeland. In the absence of other formal organisations for rights advocacy, associations' appeals to this frame emerge as a civic resource for the irregular newcomers in their permanent residency claims. At the same time, the same frame hides unequal power relations within co-ethnic communities, that is, newcomers' peripheral positions within associations and the economic costs of filing claims via associations. This situation creates a representational gap in the associational context between its active members with higher legal capital and irregular newcomers with lower legal capital. Tackling the problem of representation determined by the legal hierarchy, this study questions whether migrant associations should still be considered important political actors when undocumented/irregular migrants outnumber regulars-especially with regard to the immediate political/legal actions they require.

T1  - Shame and pride in second-generation German identity in Melbourne, Australia: emotions and white ethnicity
AN  - 1793307452
AB  - As members of an established, well-integrated, white ethnic group, second-generation Germans are largely invisible in Australian society. Given this, they are easily presumed a group for whom Gans' notion of 'symbolic ethnicity' might apply. However, based on interviews with adult children of German immigrants in Melbourne, Australia, this article suggests an alternative interpretation using recent literature on the role of emotions for identity. In the interviews with adult children of German immigrants in Melbourne, Australia, the notions of shame and pride in relation to ethnic identity were clearly evident. Shame often emerged in interaction with other people in Australia, and particularly in relation to Nazism and the Second World War. However, most respondents felt equally proud of their German heritage, particularly later in life. These findings suggest that ethnic identity for these second-generation Germans is a deeper, embodied experience that is similar to what Bourdieu terms habitus.

T1  - Does Cultural Recognition Obstruct Immigrant Integration? Evidence From Two Historic Case Studies: IMR
AN  - 1797820191
AB  - Is multiculturalism compatible with immigrant integration? While effects of minority rights and cultural recognition are controversial, I argue that not only the analysis of multicultural policies in their interaction with other structures and policies deserves more attention, but also that a historical discussion may inform current debates. Comparing and analyzing the French Huguenots in Brandenburg-Prussia (1685-1809) and Germans in the Volga region (1764-1878), I find that incorporation outcomes, despite similarly extensive cultural rights, are driven by differing opportunity structures. These findings contribute to the growing literature on multiculturalism in Europe and advocate a new approach to its analysis.

T1  - Intersectionality, the household economy, and ethnic entrepreneurship
AN  - 1795967739
AB  - The literature on ethnic entrepreneurship emphasizes the role of ethnicity in facilitating group differences in enterprise based on access to ethnic-based resources. This treatment tends to conflate family-based resources with those of ethnicity. Using a framework derived from intersectionality theory, this qualitative study investigates how two aspects of the household economy, namely household composition and family ideology, shape intra-group differences among fifty middle-class Mexican-origin entrepreneurs. Findings reveal that household class and gender dynamics shape access to three family-based resources that facilitate enterprise: family labour, entrepreneurial capital, and inheritance; differences in entrepreneurial activity between family members exceed in some cases those observed between ethnic groups. This study reveals that intersectional dimensions of identity and collectivity influence entrepreneurial outcomes within ethnic households. This study encourages researchers to consider how multiple and intersecting dimensions of identity combine for a more complete understanding of American enterprise.

T1  - Resistance and Assimilation: Transforming Security Roles of China's Largest Muslim Minorities
AN  - 1797942190
AB  - China's resurgence as an economic power has brought it increased interconnectivity to international global markets, and with it, increased exposure to transnational crimes. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the resulting increase in religious-inspired terrorist attacks have been of particular concern for the Chinese leadership. This paper aims to highlight the processes of resistance and assimilation of China's two largest Muslim minorities, the Hui and Uyghur, in successive Chinese Empires since the eighth century CE and how critical events in the past two decades have affected the way in which the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has approached relations with its Muslim minority communities. The purpose is two-fold: to expose these groups' stabilizing and destabilizing influence throughout the 1300 years of Muslim-Chinese coexistence, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Party's Policies towards its Muslim minorities.

T1  - Divided and Conquered: Immigration Reform Advocates and the Passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act
AN  - 1786515758
AB  - During and immediately after World War II, immigration reform advocacy groups successfully challenged the restrictionist spirit of the 1924 Immigration Act by blocking several proposals to halt immigration and by pushing for moderate reforms. Concerned that the blatantly racist act undermined US foreign policy interests and tarnished the country's image abroad, Congress, with the full support of the executive, repealed Chinese exclusion laws; granted citizenship and naturalization rights to Indians and Filipinos; and admitted war brides, fiancées, and European refugees outside the quota system. Marinari argues the debate and the negotiations over the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act demonstrate the limits of the inclusiveness of the US political system during the early years of the Cold War and the difficulties of creating diverse coalitions among ethnically diverse immigration reform advocates.

T1  - The Inner Geographies of a Migrant Gateway: Mapping the Built Environment and the Dynamics of Caribbean Mobility in Manchester, 1951-2011
AN  - 1778950102
AB  - Between the 1960s and 1990s a series of urban redevelopment projects in Manchester radically transformed ethnic settlement in the city. The ward of Moss Side, which had been a gateway for Caribbean and African immigrants, experienced repeated slum clearances in which whole communities were relocated and large tracts of housing stock were demolished and redesigned. The relationship between these physical and demographic changes has been overshadowed by the persisting stigmatization of Moss Side as a racialized "ghetto," which has meant that outsiders have constructed the area as possessing a fixed and homogenous identity. This article uses geographic information systems in conjunction with local surveys and archival records to explore how the dynamics of immigrant mobility within Moss Side were shaped by housing stock, external racism, family strategies, and urban policy. Whereas scholarship on ethnic segregation in Britain has focused on the internal migration of ethnic groups between administrative areas, using areal interpolation to connect demographic data and the built environment reveals the intense range of movements that developed within the variegated urban landscape of Moss Side.

Their critical consciousness emerged through praxis (reflection/action) while focusing on preserving ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona. Because the SJEP home was in ethnic studies, the youth also struggled to keep their program alive. The Arizona Department of Education claimed the program bred 'radicals' who wanted to overthrow the government and therefore lobbied the state legislature to ban K-12 ethnic studies in public schools. In January 2012, the ban went into effect, shutting down ethnic studies classes as well as the SJEP. Young people's qualitative research on their struggle led to action to save the education that gave them hope for a more equitable and just world. The article addresses the praxis of YPAR, which sparks a thought process leading to the drive to take action. Observing and documenting educational injustices inspire the need to seek radical change of Self and schools. Through the reflection and action facilitated by YPAR, young people of color construct a message about the importance of ethnic studies for individual as well as social transformation.

T1  - Zones of Difference, Boundaries of Access: Moral Geography and Community Mapping in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire
AN  - 1768022783
AB  - In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 18% of men who have sex with men (MSM) are HIV-positive. Based on ethnographic research conducted among HIV peer educators and activists in Abidjan, I examine their narratives and hand-drawn maps of city space. I draw on a methodological process of map-making to examine research participants' evaluations of neighborhoods and link these evaluations to debates over national and cultural belonging in Côte d'Ivoire. I suggest a moral geography emerges from the maps and narratives and ask what the bioethical implications of moral geography are in the context of service delivery and activism among sexual minorities.

T1  - Religious minorities and secularism: an alternative view of the impact of religion on the political values of Muslims in Europe
AN  - 1784150903
AB  - This paper proposes an alternative explanation of Muslims' endorsement of secular values based on their belonging to religious minorities. We argue that, contrary to what is often asserted in both the academic literature and the public debate, Muslims' endorsement of secular values is not simply a matter of strong individual religiosity, but may also result from belonging to a religious minority. We suggest that this group-level variable may explain differences in the support for democratic values by Muslims in Europe, in addition to the individual-level variable pertaining to individual religiosity. Our findings show that belonging to a religious minority in the country of origin positively affects the degree of support of secularist values. More generally, they suggest that denominational Muslim identities should be investigated by taking into account the role of belonging to religious minorities. Moreover, the article will show how belonging to a religious minority can moderate the negative effect of religiosity on secular values.

T1  - Techniques for Protecting Minority Languages under Belgian Federalism
AN  - 1855325765
AB  - As one of the few countries in the Council of Europe, Belgium has, to date, not ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as well as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Nevertheless, minorities are protected in Belgium due to its specific federal structure. Several instruments provide a balance between the two major language groups in the country: the Flemish and the French-speaking language group. This article focuses on these special techniques and situates them in the historical and specific judicial background of Belgium.

T1  - Territoriality and Minority Language Rights
AN  - 1855323436
AB  - Territorial principle emerges not only in domestic legislations on language rights, but also in international documents. The article aims at offering an overview of the interpretations of territoriality in international documents relevant for minority language rights, with a special focus on the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. While states often use territorial requirements as a tool of political control over minority language use, the interpretation of their obligations under the two Council of Europe treaties would require a more practical and technical approach to territorial limitations.

AN  - 1830662397
AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the inclusion of patriotic elements in the curricula of elementary school subjects which are adapted to a multicultural environment. The legislative framework of the educational system in Slovenia anticipates the modification of curricula when elements of a minority's identity are in question. The results of the analysis can be summarised in two sets of findings: the method of the inclusion of patriotic elements differs firstly according to the subject's curriculum (absence of a strategic approach), and secondly depending on the minority in question. It seems as if the integration of patriotic elements in the curricula of both national minorities is coincidental.

AN  - 1784139364
AB  - This work is an attempt to describe the reproduction of ethnic/national boundaries as a closed self-referential cognitive process that reproduces itself from itself. It describes some aspects of how this complex interrelation between cognitive structures and the formation of ethnic/national groups functions on the example of ethnic policies of 'social harmony' on the Northeast China and 'national unity' in the Russian Far East. The article shows how ethnic policies in both countries demonstrate the inability to provide either harmony or unity. However, these disappointed expectations return into national discourse as political ideologies that help preserve the government's legitimacy, legitimacy of the idea of nation/ethnicity and motivate the society to continue the nation-building process.

T1  - Sense of Place and Mental Wellness of Visible Minority Immigrants in Hamilton, Ontario: Revelations from Key Informants
AN  - 1778915998
AB  - This paper explores key informants’ revelations on immigrants’ sense of place and mental wellness in Hamilton, Ontario, directed toward processes and programs that challenge belongingness and integration. Grounded in key informant interviews, our analysis underscores the importance of understanding immigrants’ sense of community, belonging embedded in socioeconomic conditions, and implications on mental wellness. It is proposed that settlement service providers and other stakeholders adopt a broad and multifaceted approach that recognizes the importance of addressing immigrants’ conditions in a holistic manner. This could be achieved by focusing on policies that affect all determinants of health (including mental health) through the integration of public policies into a comprehensive package of health improvement and promotion strategies, and should be incorporated into policies of health and health-related institutions for implementation.

T1  - Do Immigrants' Preferences for Neighbourhood Qualities Contribute to Segregation? The Case of Oslo
AN  - 1784151344
AB  - Ethnic residential segregation is often explained with the claim that 'immigrants don't want to integrate-they prefer to stick together with co-ethnics'. By contrast, mixed neighbourhoods are seen as crucial for achieving social cohesion. In line with spatial assimilation theory there is a normative assumption that people interact with those living nearby. From interviews on neighbourhood qualities and locations valued by Oslo residents of Turkish, Somali and Polish backgrounds, we raise questions about the validity of two assumptions: that most immigrants want to live in the same neighbourhoods as co-ethnics; and that they want to live close to co-ethnics because they do not want to integrate. For reasons of socialisation, main preferences were for mixed neighbourhoods that included ethnic Norwegians. Whereas the preference for people of other immigrant backgrounds was linked to possibilities for socialisation, the preference for ethnic Norwegians in the neighbourhood was linked to possibilities for social integration. Co-ethnic networks could be maintained on the city level. Importantly, housing moves tended to be guided by other factors than population composition in the area.

T1  - An Immigrant's Tale: The Mexican American Southwest 1850 to 1950
AN  - 1778950084
AB  - Recent scholarship on Mexican Americans in the United States, relying largely on qualitative evidence, sees racism and exploitation as the major explanatory factors in their history. Using representative samples of persons of Mexican origin, we argue that immigration is fundamental to their historical experience. A small, beleaguered community in 1850, the Mexican-origin population grew during the late nineteenth century due to greater security under US jurisdiction. However, immigration between 1900 and 1930 created a Southwest broadly identified with persons of Mexican origin. Economic development in Mexico, restriction of European immigration to the United States, and extreme cross-border wage differentials prompted extensive emigration. Despite low human capital, circular migration, and discrimination, immigrant Mexicans earned substantially higher wages than workers in Mexico or native-born Hispanics in the United States. They followed typical immigrant paths toward urban areas with high wages. Prior to 1930, their marked tendency to repatriate was not "constructed" or compelled by the state or employers, but fit a conventional immigrant strategy. During the Depression, many persons of Mexican origin migrated to Mexico; some were deported or coerced, but others followed this well-established repatriation strategy. The remaining Mexican-origin population, increasingly native born, enjoyed extraordinary socioeconomic gains in the 1940s; upward mobility, their family forms, and rising political activity resembled those of previous immigrant-origin communities. In the same decade, however, the Bracero Program prompted mass illegal immigration and mass deportation, a pattern replicated throughout the late twentieth century. These conditions repeatedly replenished ethnicity and reignited nativism, presenting a challenge not faced by any other immigrant group in US history.

T1  - Ukrainian Canadians, Canada, Ukraine, and the Popular Imagination
AN  - 1749279512
AB  - This special issue of Canadian Ethnic Studies is being published at the intersection of two momentous events. In Canada the 125th anniversary of Ukrainian settlement will be celebrated in 2016. Although it is highly likely that individual Ukrainians came to Canada much earlier, 1891 is generally accepted as the beginning of the first wave of mass migration from Ukraine. Canada is now home to the third largest population of Ukrainians in the world (after Ukraine and Russia), numbering over 1.2 million or approximately 4% of the population in 2011. In Ukraine, contemporaneously, a battle is being waged to preserve an independent, integral Ukraine. As recently as a quarter-century ago and for centuries before, the preceding reference would have been to “establishing,” not “preserving,” an independent Ukraine. In the century preceding 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, Ukraine’s cultural heritage was under threat—as it had been for centuries before—but a variant of it was preserved and developed in Canada. This fact was noted with some surprise by Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine’s second president, when he was serenaded in Ukrainian by school children enrolled in the English-Ukrainian Bilingual program in Edmonton on October 25, 1994. With Ukraine’s declaration of independence, Ukrainian Canadians at last had an independent homeland with which they could identify. Older generations—especially the so-called “DPs” (Displaced Persons) who had been forced to leave Ukraine during and after World War II—returned to visit the country that had been preserved only in their memories. They came back to Canada having realized that their true homeland was Canada and were grateful for it. This realization was no doubt helped along when their naively offered, unsolicited advice on various matters was rebuffed by Ukraine’s first president, Leonid Krawchuk, who told them in no uncertain terms not to meddle in Ukraine’s affairs. Now, finally, we all seem to be on the same page. A younger, more sophisticated, worldly, and English-speaking leadership has emerged in Ukraine—a leadership that has recognized the importance of gaining the support of the Western world of which it wants to be a part. This change in attitude and outlook is exemplified by Ukraine’s national anthem: the first stanza was slightly modified in early 2013 and the result was the transformation of a dirge sung in a minor key in Canada to a triumphal hymn. Canada has responded positively and supportively to the most recent events in Ukraine, thereby eliciting President Putin’s dismissive and ill-informed comment. Canada had done the same in 1991 when Canada was the first country to recognize the newly-independent Ukraine. Of course, one does have to admit that the Canadian government’s response in both instances may not have been wholly altruistic since Ukrainians constitute the ninth largest ethnic group in the country and arguably exert more influence than their numbers might suggest because they are well organized and because of the younger, more activist leadership of their umbrella organization, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress.

T1  - Gypsies and Travellers: a big or divided society?
AN  - 1728661985; 201534223
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore the impact of localism on vulnerable minorities like Gypsies and Travellers. This paper draws on the literature on social contract, with particular reference to Hobbes, Rawls and Habermas. The key findings of this paper indicate that localism can impede equality but also that statist forms of centralism can be counterproductive to the achievement of equality. The insights in this paper contribute to the literature on equality by proposing a policy framework which fuses the participatory and deliberative practices associated with forms of localism with the safeguards and protection of centralism.

T1  - Unpacking the Roma Participation Puzzle: Presence, Voice and Influence
AN  - 1667946796; 201509574
AB  - The idea that Roma communities need to be included in public life is rather uncontroversial, widely accepted by Roma activists, academics and policy-makers in national and transnational political contexts. But, what do we mean by participation? Are we talking about formal political structures or do we refer to the capacity of ordinary Roma to have a presence in public life? The right to participation for minorities is specified by international norms but is interpreted differently in national contexts. Nevertheless, participation alone is not enough, thus minorities require 'effective' participation given that the utilitarian principles of liberal democracy means that groups such as Roma will always be outvoted. This article is based on the conviction that addressing the multiple and inter-connected issues facing Roma communities across Europe requires the participation of Roma in social, economic and political life. Whilst the article acknowledges the structural barriers which inhibit attempts to foster the integration of Roma communities, it does consider different conceptions of political participation including presence, voice and influence and how these are understood by the European Union and its member states with regards to Roma.

T1  - Political Perceptions in the Obama Era: Diverse Opinions of the Great Recession and Its Aftermath among Whites, Latinos, and Blacks
AN  - 1708525116; 201528885
AB  - Using three national surveys from the Great Recession period in America, I demonstrate two aspects of group-based political attitudes beyond citizens' partisanship preferences: (1) the economic scapegoating of African Americans by whites during the recession and (2) Latinos' and African Americans' use of their marginalized economic status as a lens for understanding how mortgage companies and bankers treated their communities during the downturn. I also discuss the broad impact of disparate economic opinions on citizens' political outlook for the future. The key patterns of political attitudes are shown to be remarkably consistent from 2009 to 2012. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Are Perceptions of Discrimination Unidimensional, Oppositional, or Intersectional? Examining the Relationship among Perceived Racial-Ethnic-, Gender-, and Age-Based Discrimination
AN  - 1700675479; 201525220
AB  - This study investigates the relationship among perceptions of racial-ethnic, age, and gender discrimination for racial-ethnic minority individuals. Three broad frameworks for understanding discrimination are described: unidimensional, oppositional, and intersectional. The strengths of each approach are assessed by analyzing data from the General Social Surveys (2002, 2006, and 2010). Findings provide no support for the oppositional framework, qualified support for the unidimensional framework, and strong support for the intersectional framework. Many racial-ethnic minorities perceive discrimination on the basis of only one social status. Among older respondents, however, more than half of those who perceive racial-ethnic discrimination also perceive discrimination based on age. Half of the racial-ethnic women surveyed who perceive racial-ethnic discrimination also perceive gender discrimination. Moreover, perceptions of gender-, age-, and race-based discrimination are significantly and positively correlated with one another. The results highlight the benefits of using an intersectional framework to conceptualize and analyze multiple forms of discrimination. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AS MULTIPLE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION? PREDICTORS OF DIGITAL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN SLOVENIA
AN  - 1644297793
AB  - A significant decreasing trend in political participation could be observed in so-called Western democracies in the last decades of the 20th century. In this framework, researchers largely agree on the key factors of participation: from generational differences and socio-economic status through civic values to civic competencies. The emergence and expansion of the Internet have brought new opportunities to expand political participation practices and to include in these practices certain groups which have so far been less active. By analysing the presence of various forms of participation via the Internet in Slovenia, we assess a thesis on the (possible) expansion of space for political participation and search for answer(s) to research questions about the relationship between traditional forms of political participation in general and digital forms of participation: a) are online forms merely combining with other traditional forms of participation; or b) are they emerging as a new type of political participation? We also investigate whether digital participation does indeed involve new groups of people and who are potential 'digital citizens'. In the analysis, we use the latest data from the Slovenian Public Opinion Survey 2013, which includes both information on the forms of political participation generally and information on digital-specific forms of participation.

T1  - How racial cues affect support for American racial hierarchy among African Americans and Whites
AN  - 2571041518
AB  - Though racial hierarchy has been critical to American political development and continues to color much of American politics, little is known about the extent to which political factors mitigate or exacerbate support for the racial status quo. Using insights gained from research on system justification and racial priming, this paper examines how the use of negative racial cues by political elites affects support for American racial hierarchy among African Americans and Whites, where racial hierarchy is assessed both explicitly (with survey items) and implicitly (with the Implicit Association Test). Results from two original experiments suggest that the effect of elite racial cues on support for racial hierarchy is moderated by political ideology, and the strength and direction of the effects varies by racial group and the type of support for racial hierarchy – explicit or implicit – being examined.

T1  - On the relationship between personal experience, affect and risk perception: The case of climate change
AN  - 1660020455; 201505484
AB  - Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the 'cognitive' model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed.

T1  - A Preliminary Examination of African American and Caucasian Hospitality Management Student Perceptions and Attitudes Toward Diversity Issues
AN  - 1700676663; 201525293
AB  - Diversity or multiculturalism is a concept that includes words such as acceptance and respect. A movement toward diversity should include the examination of differences in a safe, cultivating, and constructive environment. One such environment is classrooms located on college and university campuses across the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine a cross-section of hospitality management students based on their ethnicity. A self-selected convenience sample of students were used with data being collected using a paper-and-pencil survey measuring attitudes and perceptions toward various diversity concepts. It was found that differences existed between the two ethnic groups around specific concepts of workplace equity. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The dialogicality of cleanliness 'thematizing' the clean/dirty antinomy in the background of the theory of social representations
AN  - 1728663366; 201533980
AB  - Speltini and Passini manuscript points to a theoretical framework for exploring the psychosocial dimensions of the issue of cleanliness addressing the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies. In particular, the authors discuss the symbolic and normative valence of the issue of cleanliness and demonstrate its social and cultural rootedness feeding negative attitudes and adverse emotions towards persons and groups. Elaborating on the arguments of Speltini and Passini, I endorse the conceptual overlapping between the issue of cleanliness and the dialogical notion of basic themata. In the background of social representation theory, the process of anchoring serves as context for addressing this conceptual overlapping and for challenging the profound interrelationship between the issue of cleanliness and the theme of intergroup dynamics and inter-ethnic encounters.

T1  - Being White Helps: Intersections of Self-Concealment, Stigmatization, Identity Formation, and Psychological Distress in Racial and Sexual Minority Women
AN  - 1641424334; 201500277
AB  - This study had two objectives: (1) examine the impact of self-concealment on identity formation and on degree of psychological distress and (2) examine the impact of perceived stigma on identity formation and on degree of psychological distress. Analyses were conducted on a diverse sample of 166 women, ages 18-32 (white lesbian, non-white lesbian, white heterosexual, and non-white heterosexual). Findings revealed that self-concealment was positively associated with psychological distress in stigmatized women, but unrelated to psychological distress in the non-stigmatized group. Furthermore, although perceived stigma negatively impacted identity formation in the heterosexual groups, it did not impact either group of lesbians. Finally, non-white heterosexual women's perception of stigma was associated with psychological distress. Implications and specific psychological health disparities between groups are discussed.

T1  - Transgressing community: the case of Muslims in a twenty-first-century British city
AN  - 1551000471; 201428992
AB  - This paper draws on ethnographic research carried out in Birmingham, UK -- a city significant for its sizeable Muslim population and its iconic role in the history of minority ethnic settlement in Britain -- to consider how associations of place and ethnicity work in different ways to inform ideas about 'Muslim community' in twenty-first-century Britain. The paper charts happenings around a local event in an area of majority Asian settlement and how representations of the area as a place of Muslim community were used to implicate it in the 'war on terror'. The paper goes on to show how this sensibility is disrupted by Muslims themselves through alternative engagements with space and ethnicity. The paper argues that these offer a ground for making Muslim community in ways that actively engage with histories and patterns of ethnic settlement in the city rather than being determined by them.

T1  - Social Exclusion of Children: Developmental Origins of Prejudice
AN  - 1543801910
AB  - Over the past decade, developmental and social psychological research has explicitly adopted a developmental intergroup framework, integrating social and developmental psychology fields to understand the origins of social exclusion and prejudice. This article argues that a social developmental analysis of how groups and individuals experience, evaluate, and understand exclusion is essential for a complete picture of the human experience, interpretation, and consequences of exclusion. What has been missing in much of the social psychological research on exclusion is an incorporation of developmental perspectives; likewise, what has been missing in development psychological research is a focus on group identity and group dynamics for understanding the basis for exclusionary behavior in childhood. Yet, the roots of adult forms of exclusion can be documented in childhood, and children who experience exclusion are particularly at risk for negative outcomes, and especially when exclusion is based on group membership. Moreover, interventions designed to ameliorate social problems associated with exclusion need to be based on an understanding of how, why, and under what conditions, children and groups make decisions to exclude others, how they experience this exclusion, and how exclusion originates and changes over the course of the lifespan. Thus, a growing body of psychological work, exemplified in this issue of the Journal of Social Issues (2014), highlights implications for theory in psychology and related social sciences, and for interventions and policies to tackle social exclusion.

T1  - Beyond Treatment and Impact: A Context-Oriented Approach to Employment Discrimination
AN  - 1512220941; 201408813
AB  - Discrimination remains integral to understanding both how inequality is produced and how it can be remedied in employment settings. Yet like many sociological concepts, the notion of discrimination involves an uneasy mapping of theory to practice. Traditional conceptualizations of discrimination as differential treatment are ill-fitted to the structural and relational nature of much discrimination in the contemporary era. The disparate impact doctrine, which recognizes policies or practices that systematically disadvantage protected groups, picks up some of the theoretical slack, but offers little in the way of conceptualizing individuals' complex and entangled experiences with inequality at work. In this article, I provide a conceptual reorganization of theories of discrimination, underscoring recent calls to move beyond the confines of the current disparate treatment and disparate impact binary by recognizing the structurally and culturally embedded nature of bias and discrimination. Drawing on recent sociological research as well as my own analysis of legal records and interviews with plaintiffs involved in high-profile sex and race lawsuits settled in the past decade, I illustrate how differential treatment emerges in the context of and enabled by systems of vulnerability and privilege, workplace culture, and compositional asymmetries. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of this framework for antidiscrimination enforcement efforts. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - A meta-analytic test of the imagined contact hypothesis
AN  - 1512219580; 201408606
AB  - Imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) is a new indirect contact strategy for promoting tolerance and more positive intergroup relations. Despite its relatively recent inception, there have now been over 70 studies showing that imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member can reduce prejudice and encourage positive intergroup behavior. With this meta-analysis, we provide the first quantitative review of imagined contact effects on four key measures of intergroup bias: attitudes, emotions, intentions, and behavior. We also test for moderators arising from both group and study design characteristics. The analysis found that imagined contact resulted in significantly reduced intergroup bias across all four dependent variables (overall d+ = 0.35). The effect was significant for both published and unpublished studies, and emerged across a broad range of target outgroups and contexts. The effect was equally strong for explicit and implicit attitude measures, but was stronger on behavioral intentions than on attitudes, supporting the direct link between imagery and action proposedly underlying mental simulation effects. Most design characteristics had no significant impact, including valence of the imagined interaction, type of control condition, and time spent imagining contact. However, the more participants were instructed to elaborate on the context within which the imagined interaction took place, the stronger the effect. The imagined contact effect was also stronger for children than for adults, supporting the proposition that imagined contact is a potentially key component of educational strategies aiming to promote positive social change.

T1  - When Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Preventing Discrimination of Nonstandard Speakers
AN  - 1504424509; 201406703
AB  - Prejudice against a social group may lead to discrimination of members of this group. One very strong cue of group membership is a (non)standard accent in speech. Surprisingly, hardly any interventions against accent-based discrimination have been tested. In the current article, we introduce an intervention in which what participants experience themselves unobtrusively changes their evaluations of others. In the present experiment, participants in the experimental condition talked to a confederate in a foreign language before the experiment, whereas those in the control condition received no treatment. Replicating previous research, participants in the control condition discriminated against Turkish-accented job candidates. In contrast, those in the experimental condition evaluated Turkish- and standard-accented candidates as similarly competent. We discuss potential mediating and moderating factors of this effect.

T1  - Latino and Latina Educational Attainment: An Investigation of Bi-Lingual Language Abilities and the Familial Context
AN  - 1567049314; 201435088
AB  - Compared to other ethnic groups in the United States, Latinos have been shown to have lower levels of school performance. Researchers have often pointed to characteristics such as lower family incomes and greater numbers of children as reasons for their lower levels of academic success. Previous studies also suggest that language abilities, particularly English skills, may present barriers for Latino children to perform well in school. Using data from the 2004 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles survey, this study directly examines the relative impact of family and language characteristics on the school performance and educational attainment of young adult Latinas and Latinos. Overall, females are shown to have higher academic performance and attainment. Family characteristics appear to have a greater impact on females' educational success, whereas males' educational success appears to be more susceptible to the influence of language characteristics, particularly with regard to Spanish language skills.

T1  - The contribution of the population of disabled people to the attainment of Europe 2020 Strategy headline targets
AN  - 1494300544; 201402008
AB  - This study seeks to quantify the potential contribution of one of the most disadvantaged groups in Europe, namely Europe's population of disabled people, to the attainment of the Europe 2020 Strategy targets via the monitoring of a number of indicators, at a time when, given the current economic crisis, the majority of European countries are struggling to attain these goals. The impact of changes in the situation of disabled people is simulated using micro data drawn from the 2009 European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our results show that improving the socio-economic situation of the disabled population could be crucial for attaining Europe 2020 targets. However, future policy designs at national level will need to take into account the actual definition of disability that is employed, the heterogeneity of circumstances to be found within such a definition, and the gap between the situation of the disabled and non-disabled populations.

T1  - The Relation Between Parental Racial Socialization and African Americans' Racial Ideologies
AN  - 1438564599; 201340215
AB  - Racial ideology shapes how African Americans interpret the world and cope with race-related issues and events. A complex interaction of individual, family, and group experiences in one's sociocultural and historical context is critical to the development of racial ideology. While parental racial socialization has been associated with racial identity, the more specific relationship between parental racial socialization and racial ideology is less understood. The present study examined the association of four dimensions of racial socialization messages reported by participants (cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarian socialization) with four dimensions of racial ideology (assimilationist, humanist, oppressed minority, and nationalist) using hierarchical linear regression (n = 89 African American college students). Participants' endorsement of assimilationist and oppressed minority ideologies was not predicted by racial socialization messages. However, endorsement of humanist and nationalist ideologies was predicted by cultural and egalitarian socialization messages in opposing directions. Cultural socialization was associated with endorsement of higher nationalist and lower humanist ideology, whereas egalitarian socialization was associated with the endorsement of lower nationalist and higher humanist ideology.

T1  - Prejudice toward American Muslims
AN  - 1703413151
AB  - This study explores prejudice toward American Muslims. Prejudice is conceptualized using Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory (ITT). ITT identifies four kinds of threat that can lead to prejudice: realistic threats, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Data were gathered in the United States (N = 281) among self-identified Christians. Findings confirm: 1) a positive correlation between real and symbolic threats, and stereotypes, 2) increased contact with an immigrant group, in this case Muslims, is negatively correlated with perceptions of real and symbolic threat, and 3) levels of prejudice differ based on level of education. Theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between prejudice, interpersonal contact/communication, and education are discussed.

T1  - Cohesion without participation: immigration and migrants' associations in Italy
AN  - 1448995994; 201342879
AB  - Italian migration and citizenship policies tend to deny the fact that immigration in Italy is now a structural phenomenon embedded in the labour market and Italian society. The first part of Mantovan's article examines this denial in terms of the apparent difficulty many in Italian society have in accepting the social changes caused by Italy's rapid transition from a country of emigration to one of immigration. She argues that this reluctance to accept the fact of immigration is exacerbated by Italy's fragile national social cohesion, which has led to policy attempts to buttress social cohesion with respect to immigrants' relationship to Italian society. The Italian version of social cohesion is based on an 'implicit model' of immigrant integration and a citizenship regime defined by jus sanguinis. The second part of her paper evaluates Italian social cohesion as to how it manages the social changes caused by immigration, and looks at the evolution and characteristics of immigrants' participation in migrant associations. The principal measure adopted, that is, to include selected, co-opted migrant representatives from immigrant groups in consultative and advisory bodies, remained too dependent on the Italian authorities and voluntary organizations. These political migrants' associations ultimately failed, and led immigrants to withdraw and form their own cultural associations that better met their needs. Accordingly, the measures taken to promote migrants' participation through immigrants' associations functioned more as a mechanism to reduce ethnic complexity and the Otherness represented by migrants rather than as a viable, long-term means of facilitating their access to Italian citizenship. Overall, Italian policies have weakened social cohesion by reproducing and reinforcing structural inequalities among immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Every Shut Eye, Ain't Sleep": The Role of Racism-Related Vigilance in Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Sleep Difficulty
AN  - 1494749926; 201402049
AB  - Although racial/ethnic disparities in health have been well characterized in biomedical, public health, and social science research, the determinants of these disparities are still not well understood. Chronic psychosocial stress related specifically to the American experience of institutional and interpersonal racial discrimination may be an important determinant of these disparities, as a growing literature in separate scientific disciplines documents the adverse health effects of stress and the greater levels of stress experienced by non-white compared to white Americans. However, the empirical literature on the importance of stress for health and health disparities specifically due to racial discrimination, using population-representative data, is still small and mixed. In this paper, we explore the association between a novel measure of racially salient chronic stress-"racism-related vigilance"-and sleep difficulty. We found that, compared to the white adults in our sample, black (but not Hispanic) adults reported greater levels of vigilance. This vigilance was positively associated with sleep difficulty to similar degrees for all racial/ethnic groups in our sample (white, black, Hispanic). Black adults reported greater levels of sleep difficulty compared to white adults. This disparity was slightly attenuated after adjustment for education and income. However, this disparity was completely attenuated after adjustment for racism-related vigilance. We found similar patterns of results for Hispanic compared to white adults, however, the disparities in sleep difficulty were smaller and not statistically significant. Because of the importance of sleep quality to health, our results suggest that the anticipation of and perseveration about racial discrimination is an important determinant of racial disparities in health.

T1  - The Empire Prays Back: Religion, Secularity, and Queer Critique
AN  - 1429625457; 201335708
AB  - The past decades have been ones of unprecedented sociocultural and legal gains for queer politics. But these achievements have been accompanied by a severe critique of queer racism and of the imperialist agenda of global gay politics. The employment of gender and sexuality as alibis for legitimizing violence against religious groups, especially Muslims, has opened up fundamental questions regarding the future of queer emancipatory politics. While supportive of the urgency of critiquing the complicities of Western queer politics in neoliberal, imperial discourses, I am troubled by the silences on and the lack of critique of homophobia and heterosexism in diasporic and postcolonial contexts. The unwillingness to address the violent experiences of those subjects who are vulnerable to both queer racism as well as postcolonial heteronormativity has become the Achilles' heel of the recent postsecular turn in queer postcolonial scholarship and activism. Religious violence against sexual minorities is ignored by prioritizing violence against religious minorities. The sole focus on queer racism and homonationalism in the global North neglects how supposedly conflicting ideologies of heteronormative nationalisms on both sides of the postcolonial divide in fact collaborate with each other. There is an urgent need to explore nonimperialist strategies of contesting heterosexism and homophobia in diasporic and postcolonial contexts and pursue a more complex, multidirectional politics of critique that is directed at coercive practices across the secularism-religion divide. Critique, when engaging with solely one dimension of domination, risks reproducing violence. Thus, anti-imperialist and antiracist critique of queer politics must be accompanied by a critique of "reproductive heteronormativity" within postcolonial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Arranged Marriages as Support for Intra-ethnic Matchmaking? A Case Study on Muslim Migrants in Germany
AN  - 1364702404; 201323432
AB  - This article discusses the behavioural and institutional mechanisms that guide the matchmaking process of arranged marriages amongst Muslim migrants in Germany and clarifies how this practice may influence ethnic homogamy. The focus is on general characteristics of arranged marriages rather than differences between diverse ethnic groups. The methodology is qualitative due to the sensitive and complex topic and the current state of research. Typically, the whole family is deeply involved in the process of arrangement, which consists of three stages (pre-engagement, engagement, marriage). Thereby, the extension of parental scope of action by means of institutionalized admission procedures turns out to be vitally important. In consideration of the fact that mate selection takes place at the pre-engagement stage, it is the most crucial. Furthermore, differences to other partner-choosing processes are at their most distinct at this point, being responsible for the identification and labelling of this model as an arranged marriage. Selection criteria are mainly determined by the reputation of the marriage candidate and her/his family along with cultural features (such as belonging to a particular religious group, ethnicity or nationality). In our study, preferences for a cultural homogenous match were the most dominant ones. This inclination may cause the tendency towards transnational marriages when there are no suitable marriage candidates to be found in Germany. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article aims to study the incorporation of homeland-based cultural practices of minorities within a majority cultural space and the dynamics of mutual incorporation of cultural practices of the majority and first-generation minority Tamils and Somalis in Norway. Homeland-based cultural practices refer to culturally rooted practices and habits that had been followed by Tamils and Somalis while they were living in their home country. While discussing tensions around the minority cultural practices in a majority cultural space, the article suggests a model for mutual incorporation of cultural practices of the majority and minorities.

T1  - Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: Macro-level Symbolic Threat Increases Prejudice Against Gay Men
AN  - 1504422883; 201405314
AB  - Two studies examined the impact of macrolevel symbolic threat on intergroup attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 71), participants exposed to a macrosymbolic threat (vs. nonsymbolic threat and neutral topic) reported less support toward social policies concerning gay men, an outgroup whose stereotypes implies a threat to values, but not toward welfare recipients, a social group whose stereotypes do not imply a threat to values. Study 2 (N = 78) showed that, whereas macrolevel symbolic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward gay men, macroeconomic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward Asians, an outgroup whose stereotypes imply an economic threat. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of a general climate of threat in shaping intergroup attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Capital Formation and Diversity: Impacts of Individual and Place-Related Characteristics
AN  - 1551001454; 201429076
AB  - Using structural equation modelling, we assess the degree to which the characteristics of both individuals and the cities in which they live may affect scores on three domains underlying social capital-trust, interaction and membership. We find that diversity, as it relates to both the individual and the city of residence, affects social capital formation. However, the impact of diversity is not necessarily negative. As the proportion of visible minorities in a city increases, the average level of trust decreases, suggesting that, on this dimension at least, increased diversity can have a negative impact on this aspect of social capital formation. However, as contextual or city-level diversity increases, the level of participation in organisations and trust in others increases. This suggests that bridging social capital can increase as diversity increases. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond prejudice to prejudices
AN  - 1417526347; 201332052
AB  - Different groups, because they are perceived to pose different threats, elicit different prejudices. Collective action by disadvantaged groups can amplify the perception of specific threats, with predictable and potentially counterproductive consequences. It is important to carefully consider the threat-based psychology of prejudice(s) before implementing any strategy intended to promote positive social change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The influence of racial histories on economic development strategies
AN  - 1373428349; 201328548
AB  - For more than a century, white communities across the United States employed strategies to remain all-white, including violent acts, forcibly driving minorities out of town, and local ordinances. One particularly widespread and effective approach used by many towns to exclude certain groups of people from living in their towns was the creation of a 'sundown town'. This paper seeks to examine the association between past sundown policies and one component of community life that many towns currently struggle with: economic development. By examining the racial histories and economic development activities of 428 towns in the Midwest and nontraditional South, the study examines whether historical legacy can carry over to the present and affect economic development. Findings suggest that former sundown towns currently pursue fewer economic development activities than towns that have a history of being inclusive, even after controlling for a community's assets.

T1  - Deconstructing Good Times and The Cosby Show: In Search of My "Authentic" Black Experience
AN  - 1373427882; 201328616
AB  - As countless critics of The Cosby Show (1984-1992) would have us believe, the Huxtable family, as portrayed and envisioned by educator and comedian Bill Cosby, is not the traditional representation of Black family life. For many critics, as well as some Cosby show defenders, the experience depicted by the fictional Huxtable family was the unique experience of too few African Americans at the time; the suggestion is that the family is very wealthy. Contrary to the moral majority, its critics and defenders, I am not from the upper or middle classes like the Huxtable family; however, I identified with The Cosby Show more than with its predecessors, like Good Times (1974-1979). African Americans are no different than any other American group, and therefore, as writer and novelist Wendy Alexia Rountree suggests in her article " 'Faking the Funk': A Journey Towards Authentic Blackness," we "should be allowed to develop individual identities that are not considered in conflict with our ethnic group identity but as a legitimate part of it." Consequently, as someone who identifies with The Cosby Show; who is an autistic, working-class Black female from the projects of East Harlem with two Ivy League degrees; and for whom cowboy boots are her footwear of choice, I say, take Good Times and The Cosby Show if you must, but leave me my Black experience.

T1  - Understanding and addressing the stigma of mental illness with ethnic minority communities
AN  - 1313192774
AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness.

T1  - The Ghettoization of Blacks in Los Angeles: The Emergence of Street Gangs
AN  - 1364700153; 201323330
AB  - Despite previous research, no one has traced the roots and rise of African-American street gangs in Los Angeles as it relates to the development of racially and ethnically segregated areas. This paper examines the experiences of the early African-American community and explains the cultural phenomenon that led to the formation of African-American gangs. The rapid migration of African-Americans to the city caused their population in Los Angeles to increase, and this threatened the White community. As a result of racial discrimination and racial covenants, many African-Americans became trapped in Watts, which was formerly a White middle-class community of government employees and white-collar workers. This transformed South Central (Watts) into a ghetto of predominantly poor urban Black dwellers with low-paying jobs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do Survey Data Estimate Earnings Inequality Correctly?: Measurement Errors Among Black and White Male Workers
AN  - 1315600374; 201307602
AB  - Few studies have considered how earnings inequality estimates may be affected by measurement error in self-reported earnings in surveys. Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation with their W-2 earnings records, we examine the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on economic inequality estimates. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - WHAT WE FACE
AN  - 1531930673; 201423292
AB  - While many sociological studies analyze the causes, conditions, and mechanisms perpetuating American racial inequality, the literature on how African Americans understand and explain these inequalities is less developed. Drawing on 150 interviews with middle-class and working-class African American men and women, this paper analyzes inductively how respondents define and conceptualize the most pressing obstacles facing their group when probed on this question. We find that middle- and working-class respondents alike identify the problem of racism as the most salient obstacle facing African Americans. Class differences appear with respect to what other obstacles are singled out as salient: while middle-class respondents focus on lack of racial solidarity among Blacks and economic problems (in this order), working-class respondents are more concerned with the fragility of the Black family followed by the lack of racial solidarity. This analysis discusses the relevance of considering how groups make sense of obstacles, and of racism and discrimination in particular, for the study of destigmatization and antiracist strategies of stigmatized minorities.

T1  - Unequal recognition, misrecognition and injustice: The case of religious minorities in Denmark
AN  - 1081864723; 201235284
AB  - Euro-multiculturalism is (1) concerned with religiously defined immigrant minorities; (2) sees policies of recognition as a means to secure multicultural equality between groups; (3) endorses the moderate secularism of European states; and (4) adopts a contextualist approach to answering the normative question. Proponents of 'Euro-multiculturalism' want to ask when unequal recognition by the state of religious communities is a form of misrecognition and when it is unjust (or wrong). The article discusses the question by way of an examination of the Danish case of unequal recognition by the state of religious minorities. It argues that state-religion relations can be analysed as relations of recognition, which are not only unequal but also multi-dimensional, and that it is difficult to answer the question whether multi-dimensional recognitive inequalities are unjust or wrong if one endorses moderate secularism and contextualism.

T1  - Ethnogenesis, Ethnicity, And "Cultural Refusal": The Case of the Salasacas in Highland Ecuador
AN  - 1438549202; 201340197
AB  - The Salasacas are one of several indigenous peoples in highland Ecuador who consider themselves, and are considered by others, to be a distinct, homogeneous blood group. Throughout the Incaic, Spanish, and national periods, we trace their ethnogenesis from diverse origins to a single, highly unified ethnic community, Using an interdisciplinary methodology that combines historical and ethnographic data and follows the movement of current Salasaca anthroponyms, we identify three seventeenth-century migrations of different groups to Salasaca. These groups were still separate in the eighteenth century, and we follow their fusion into a single, exclusive, and vocal ethnic group in the post-independence period. We focus careful attention on their often novel responses to multiple historical contingencies over the course of five hundred years. Departing from writers who emphasize the political nature of ethnicity, we argue that Salasaca became a zone of cultural refusal as indigenous actors made a conscious decision to maintain a specific indigenous cultural identity.

T1  - Slavic Muslims: The forgotten minority of Macedonia
AN  - 1373429797; 201328661
AB  - Despite the International Community's long running effort to foster an atmosphere of stability, progress and development, (FYR) Macedonia remains marred in interethnic tension between the Macedonian and Albanian communities. This tension has stunted all progress in a country beset by a plethora of crises ranging from chronic unemployment and corruption to increasing poverty, faltering EU and NATO candidacies as well as a protracted dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country. Until the underlying inter-ethnic tension is soothed all other issues will remain unresolved. The thesis of this paper argues that the key to creating lasting stability in (FYR) Macedonia lies with the empowerment of the country's large minority communities. The article examines one such community, the Slavic Muslims, in detail and provides justifications and recommendations for their inclusion in the decision making process. The article aims to provide a policy alternative for the International Community in general and the OSCE in particular. Given that the OSCE Mission to Skopje is the Organisation's longest serving field operation and tensions still remain extremely high; it is clear that new and innovative approaches must be taken to finally create the stability that has proved so elusive since the country's independence.

T1  - Identity Satisfaction Over the Life Course in Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266144742; 201300382
AB  - A variety of models have been proposed to understand the process of coming to terms with a sexual minority identity. What has not been so clearly explored is how an individual's satisfaction with his or her sexual identity develops over the life course. This article explores satisfaction with sexual identity in a large cohort (N = 2,269) of self-identified lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, and considers satisfaction not only from a chronos (life span) but also from a chairos (stage of development) framework. Data show a clear relationship between age group and increased satisfaction with a sexual minority identity. Resilience may be an important contributor to increased satisfaction.

T1  - Conceptualizing Professional Diaspora: International Medical Graduates in Canada
AN  - 1037883421; 201231153
AB  - This paper applies the concept of diaspora to the analysis of the creation and maintenance of an ethnically diverse community of internationally educated medical graduates residing in Canada. Traditionally, the research on diaspora concerns ethnic communities that preserve their homeland ties while residing in foreign countries. We suggest, however, that ethnic roots are not imperative for the analysis of diasporic communities when other forms of shared values and meanings can become a basis for creation of collective identity. Reconfiguring both the homeland and host country as places of geographical and professional belonging provides opportunity to conceptualize an ethnically diverse group of immigrant physicians residing in Canada as professional diaspora. Probing the interviews with 67 international medical graduates living in Canada, we demonstrate (1) how they create medical diaspora, (2) what myths and sensitivities they share in constructing their professional and/or geographic homelands, and (3) the relationship they develop with their hosting society. We suggest that in spite of the increasing mobility of internationally educated health care providers, the analysis of professional diasporas could become a useful tool for analyzing complex relationships between home countries, hosting countries, and international travelers.

T1  - The Effect of Classroom Diversity on Tolerance and Participation in England, Sweden and Germany
AN  - 1023030546; 201223877
AB  - The belief is widespread in educational circles that ethnically mixed schools contribute to inter-ethnic tolerance and community cohesion. Some political science studies, however, have found that trust and participation are lower in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. This paper explores the relation between classroom ethno-racial diversity, ethnic tolerance and participation in England, Sweden and Germany using data from the IEA Civic Education Study among 14-year-olds. Controlling for various conditions at the individual and classroom levels, it finds a positive effect of classroom diversity on ethnic tolerance in Sweden and Germany, which is in agreement with the contact perspective on inter-ethnic relations. However, it does not find an effect on tolerance in England. Moreover, classroom diversity only shows a positive relation with participation in Sweden. The effect of diversity thus varies substantially across the two outcomes of interest and the three countries examined. It is therefore tentatively concluded that country-specific factors shape this effect to a significant degree. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Paradigm Shifts, Geostrategic Considerations and Minority Initiatives
AN  - 1030866915; 201227884
AB  - Much of the analysis of ethnolinguistic minorities is case specific and concerned with the particular state or national context within which such minorities operate. This paper adopts abroad conceptual stance by focussing on how policies aimed at improving the position of ethnolinguistic minorities in Europe have been subject to broad and profound multi-level influences. These range from policies and practices which have their origin within the minority communities themselves, to the state, the European level and beyond. This paper will identify significant paradigm shifts and highlight structural tensions which derive from neo-liberal and social democratic perspectives coming into conflict as a result of closer European integration and globalization. It will conclude by identifying six salient research themes which may inform more robust policy initiatives capable of building on best practice minority policy in several EU contexts.

T1  - Perceived Expectations for Acculturation: The Transitioning of Hispanics into Southern Communities
AN  - 1266144813; 201300329
AB  - Hispanics are a rapidly growing population that has sought resettlement in nontraditional locations across the United States. Movement in and out of cultural homogeneous communities has implications for an individual's perceived expectations for cultural change. Hispanics (N = 10) in two Southern states were asked questions using semi-structured interviews surrounding their acculturation experiences. Using a grounded theory approach, several themes emerged involving the perceived acceptance of their culture, previous and current ethnic composition of their community, cultural values and behaviors underpinning interaction, and perceived pressures to maintain and change their culture. The comfort and discomfort in interacting with other cultural groups often elicited pressure to change, suppress, or maintain one's culture. Targeted intervention efforts addressing community-level acculturative expectations and individual acculturative difficulties with intercultural interaction may assist Hispanics entering nontraditional areas of resettlement. Social services and policy that recognizes the importance of multicultural growth in their communities, and seeks to identify the current state of social and relational inclusiveness of traditionally marginal groups, may improve racial and ethnic relationships and community health.

T1  - Focus groups as a tool in the construction of questionnaires: the case of discriminatory attitudes
AN  - 1081862461; 201234719
AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Lived Islam: religious identity with 'non-organized' Muslim minorities
AN  - 907927959; 201124692
AB  - The purpose of this article is to show how a focus on 'non-organized' Muslims in Europe can contribute with insights on the everyday lives and practices of Muslim minorities. The empirical foundation is interviews conducted in Germany and Denmark. I argue that by focusing on institutionalized forms of Islam we run the risk of reifying Muslims as being 'all about Islam'. The article reflects and discusses the benefits of adapting the framework of lived religion methodologically to investigate how Muslim makes sense of Islam on a micro-level. I show how the interviewees in this study have reconfigured religious practices, or no practice at all, which is connected to attitudes of privatization, individualization and pragmatism. The everyday practices and identities can be seen as expressions of minority identities, and as a type of individualized religiosity, and I discuss how these identities are different from the identities of activist and vocal Muslims.

AB  - Spain is undergoing a process of intense demographic change towards a more diverse society brought about by massive immigration over the last decade that includes a high proportion of Latin Americans. Pejoratively dubbed 'sudacas', they are moving in the opposite direction to the Spanish who went to Latin America 100 years ago. Multicultural Spain has two main facets: the historical regional minorities in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, elements of which have waged struggles for national autonomy; and the recent immigrant minorities, notably the Latin Americans, North Africans and Romanians.

T1  - 'It's a Long Way To the Bottom': The Insignificance of 'the Scots' in Australia
AN  - 1531931234; 201423351
AB  - Australian historians have been reluctant to recognize the significance of Scottish immigration and immigrants. And, until relatively recently, Scottish historians were also indifferent, possibly because Canada and New Zealand seemed more Scottish. It is thus worthwhile to ponder the ways in which Australian (and Scottish) historians have approached Scottish migration to and settlement in Australia. Neglected aspects of the Scottish experience in Australia are exposed and overexposed aspects questioned. Some of the former include the twentieth century, radical politics, sport and popular music; the latter include the nineteenth century, God and Mammon. Despite the alleged invisibility of 'the Scots' in Australia as a group, Scots have consistently been very visible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Estranged Natives and Indigenized Immigrants: A Relational Anthropology of Ethnically Mixed Towns in Israel
AN  - 856403341; 201106915
AB  - Ethnic relations between the Palestinian and Jewish communities in ethnically mixed towns in Israel are marked by class divides, political fragmentation, and perception of alienation vis-a-vis place and other. Analyzing patterns of communal identity politics, this article revisits the spatial history of Jaffa since 1948. Against theories of urban ethnocracy predicated on the convergence of state policies and capitalist accumulation, which in turn engender longstanding spatial segregation between Jews and Arabs and between new and old residents, I argue that it is precisely the indeterminate 'contact zones' between communities and spaces that constitute the political and cultural realities in these cities. Proposing a relational reading of these spatial dynamics, this article shows that in contradistinction to the basic premise of the nation-state, in Jaffa as well as other mixed towns, the coupling between space and identity collapses. The concepts of 'spatial heteronomy' and 'stranger relations' are proposed to characterize the challenge raised by ethnically mixed towns to the Jewish state and to the ethnonational logic that guides it.

T1  - Predicting Earnings Among Immigrants To Canada: The Role Of Source Country
AN  - 964189979; 201207483
AB  - The current study examines the importance of country of origin in predicting the labour market earnings among recent immigrants to Canada. The authors argue that, in addition to individual-level characteristics associated with immigrant capital, macro-level features associated with immigrant origins must be taken into account when considering the economic performance of immigrants in their host country. Country-level factors are said to accompany immigrants to their destination country, which generate disparities in the "quality" of immigrants' human and social capital across origin groups, as well as differences in how they are received by the resident population. The present study uses random effects multilevel modelling to investigate the extent to which immigrant incomes vary randomly across source country while taking into consideration individual-level characteristics selected on the basis of human capital, social capital, and discrimination theories. Multilevel regression analysis confirms that immigrant incomes indeed vary significantly by country of origin, though the effect is small. Furthermore, it is revealed that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the sending country explains much of the level 2 variability in the labour market earnings of recent immigrants, as well as the relationship between racial minority status and immigrant incomes. The practical significance and policy implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Political Participation Among Latinos in the United States: The Effect of Group Identity and Consciousness
AN  - 902083216; 201122332
AB  - Objective: How do group identity and consciousness affect Latinos' political participation in the United States? Recent studies that examine this relationship generally focus on a single ethnic group, for example, Mexicans, or the panethnic group, Latino/Hispanic, which limits the scope of their results. This study investigates how group identity and consciousness affect the political participation of differently identified Latinos. Methods: Using the unique 2007 Latino National Survey (LNS), a telephone survey of 8,500 Latino respondents, I investigate how group identity and consciousness affect political participation, as measured by electoral and nonelectoral activities. Results: Findings suggest that Latinos who self-identify as American are more likely to engage in political action; however, a sense of group consciousness among ethnic, panethnic, and racial-identified Latinos alters this effect. Conclusion: The type of and extent to which Latinos engage in political action is contingent on primary self-identity and specific aspects of group consciousness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Differences in Women's Marriage, Household Composition and Class Status: 1980-2008
AN  - 887499957; 201118149
AB  - The gender literature has demonstrated that marriage is an important economic context for and predictor of women's class status; however, with regard to this finding, the literature has paid less attention to racial/ethnic differences among women. This paper raises important questions about the presumption of marriage as a route to the middle class for all women. Using 1980, 1990, and 2000 IPUMS and 2008 ACS data for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, Whites we derive a middle class index (MCi) based on education, homeownership, per person income, and occupational prestige factors. By 2008, all groups have increased their share of SALA households, but black female SALA middle-class households comprise the highest percentage of their middle-class than do the other racial/ethnic groups. We also construct synthetic cohorts to determine if these women are simply marrying later and find that more SALA middle-class households are maintaining their status over time, but that again, this trend is most pronounced for black women.

T1  - African Americans' Lay Theories About the Detection of Prejudice and Nonprejudice
AN  - 856402938; 201106966
AB  - Two studies examine African Americans' perceptions of prejudice and nonprejudice in Whites and their perceptions of Whites' impression management behaviors related to prejudice. Responses to open-ended questions about what makes them think a person is and is not prejudiced and general advice for Whites were collected from a total of 236 African American university students. The most common behaviors listed that indicated prejudice included name calling and stereotyping. Indications of nonprejudice included positive behaviors (smiling, helping), equal treatment, and seeking out interaction with minorities. Respondents also advised Whites to be authentic. Results also indicated that common impression management behaviors by Whites may backfire. Results are discussed in terms previous research and the complicated nature of interracial interactions.

T1  - Sri Lankan Muslims: between ethno-nationalism and the global ummah
AN  - 852899029; 201103312
AB  - Sri Lanka's Sunni Muslims or 'Moors', who make up eight percent of the population, are the country's third largest ethnic group, after the Buddhist Sinhalese (seventy-four per cent) and the Hindu Tamils (eighteen per cent). Although the armed LTTE (Tamil Tiger) rebel movement was defeated militarily by government forces in May 2009, the island's Muslims still face the long-standing external threats of ethno-linguistic Tamil nationalism and pro-Sinhala Buddhist government land and resettlement policies. In addition, during the past decade a sharp internal conflict has arisen within the Sri Lankan Muslim community between locally popular Sufi sheiks and the followers of hostile Islamic reformist movements energised by ideas and resources from the global ummah, or world community of Muslims. This simultaneous combination of 'external' ethno-nationalist rivalries and 'internal' Islamic doctrinal conflict has placed Sri Lanka's Muslims in a double bind: how to defend against Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic hegemonies while not appearing to embrace an Islamist or jihadist agenda. This article first traces the historical development of Sri Lankan Muslim identity in the context of twentieth-century Sri Lankan nationalism and the south Indian Dravidian movement, then examines the recent anti-Sufi violence that threatens to divide the Sri Lankan Muslim community today.

T1  - Greek American Ethnic Identity, Cultural Experience and the "Embodied Language" of Dance: Implications for Counseling
AN  - 1081866062; 201235257
AB  - This ethnographic study aims to contribute to better counseling services for the Greek American population in the U.S. by providing cultural knowledge and insight into one of the smaller ethnic groups that has been overlooked in the literature. More specifically, it explores the role of the "embodied language" of dance in the formation of Greek American ethnic identity and the transmission of sociocultural knowledge and practices. The findings suggest that ethnic dances constitute a significant medium of transmission of cultural knowledge, and socialization into the life of the Greek American community through role modeling and intergenerational contact, as well as opportunity for fellowship and interaction with people who share common practices and traditions. All of the above contribute to a strong identification with the particular community and the development of ethnic identity. Implications for research and theory development in counseling, taking into account the embodied construction of ethnic identity, are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Identity Treat: The Role of Cultural Identifications in Moderating Closure Responses to Foreign Cultural Inflow
AN  - 1023025674; 201223926
AB  - Political theorists of globalization have argued that foreign inflows to a society can give rise to collective-identity closure-social movements aiming to narrow the in-group, and exclude minorities. In this research we investigate whether exposure to the mixing of a foreign culture with one's heritage culture can evoke need for closure, a motive that engenders ethnocentric social judgments. On the basis of a proposed identity threat mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to situations mixing foreign and heritage cultures would evoke need for closure for individuals with low foreign identification but not those with high foreign identification. An experiment with Hong Kong Chinese students varied linguistic and visual cues of Western and Chinese culture and found, as predicted, that exposure to mixed Western/Chinese conditions elevated need for closure for those low in Western identification but not those high in Western identification.

AB  - A sample of 168 African American undergraduates was surveyed to clarify past findings demonstrating a consistent relationship between endorsing negative attitudes about being African American and experiencing negative affect. Specifically, shame was tested as a mediator between participants' endorsement of preencounter attitudes (i.e., anti-Black attitudes) and both feelings of depression and global self-esteem, respectively. As predicted, shame acted as a complete mediator in both equations. Limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Today, We Are All Ahmadi': Configurations of Heretic Otherness between Lahore and Berlin
AN  - 881461977; 201116433
AB  - The Ahmadis are widely regarded as heterodox in Pakistan, where they have moved after the Partition of British India in 1947, and where they have later been declared by the state as being 'non-Muslim'. Faced with violence and discrimination on a regular basis, they have migrated in large numbers to Europe, including Germany. There, they are free to continue their religious practice, but at the same time have been treated with hostility as they become part of central city life. Faced with suspicion both at home and now in Europe, this article explores the double sense of heterodoxy which the Ahmadis now face, and explores the complex reactions, including media campaigns to which they have given rise in Germany.

T1  - The Attitude-Behavior Linkage in Behavioral Cascades
AN  - 754040474; 201049607
AB  - The assumption that individual behavior has an antecedent evaluative foundation is an important component of theories in sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. In its simplest form, the antecedent evaluation is a positive or negative attitude toward an object that may affect an individual's object-related behavior. This attitude may be influenced by the attitudes of other persons. The occurrence of such endogenous interpersonal influences, in which persons' attitudes are affected by other persons' attitudes, is among the basic postulates of social psychology. The present article advances work on the attitude-behavior linkage in behavioral cascades by jointly considering two theories: the theory of reasoned-planned action, which emphasizes the deliberative foundations of individuals' object-related behaviors, and social influence network theory, which emphasizes the group dynamics involved in the formation of individuals' attitudes.

T1  - 'Many Nice People': the nation-state, post-Fordism, and the policy norm of flexible ethnic relations in Estonia
AN  - 743055515; 201043245
AB  - This article uses historical research and ethnographic fieldwork to ask how policymakers interpret historical, political, and economic factors to construct inter-ethnic communities that would bring security and economic growth to an enlarged European Union (EU). Focusing on post-Soviet Estonia's ethnic integration policy, the article argues that 'flexibility' applies not only to post-Fordist, individualized subjects, but also to relations between subjects of different nationalities that policymakers want to form organically in service sector employment. The article explains how this policy construction emerged in light of Estonia's historical trajectory from 1991 to 2001 and demonstrates how it conceptually resolved the fundamental tension between the territorialized nation-state and deterritorialized global capitalism. A visual media campaign entitled 'Many Nice People: Integrating Estonia' captured the essence of this construction, which obscured how the Estonian nation-state marginalized minorities while integrating into the EU.

T1  - Generational differences in ethnic and religious attachment and their interrelation. A study among Muslim minorities in the Netherlands
AN  - 743050031; 201031720
AB  - Are there generational differences in ethnic and religious attachment among Muslim minorities in the Netherlands? To answer this question, we assess patterns of ethnic and religious identity and practice as well as their interrelation among Dutch Turks and Moroccans. Classical assimilation theories predict a decline in ethnic attachment over generations, but are less clear on consequences of migration on religious attachment. We use quantitative analysis to test propositions among first and second generation minorities (N = 1,861). Our data indicate that the second generation reports weaker ethnic and religious identities, and engages less in ethno-cultural and religious practices. We do find, however, that religious and ethnic identity become increasingly related for the second generation. These differences can only partly be accounted for by differences in education, employment and life course events. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sickness Absence among Immigrants in Norway, 1992--2003
AN  - 743044529; 201031609
AB  - Utilizing register panel data (1992--2003), in this article we study long-term sickness absence among immigrants and ethnic Norwegians (n = 200,022). The data contain detailed information on socio-economic background, labour market participation and social insurance benefits for all individuals aged between 16 and 67 years residing in Norway. We present four main findings: (1) There is no difference in sickness absence between ethnic Norwegians and immigrants from the other Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe after controlling for demographic, socio-economic and labour market factors; (2) the sickness absence rates are higher among individuals from Asia (men and women) and Africa (men), and lower among men from North America and Oceania compared with ethnic Norwegians; (3) second-generation immigrants share the same level of sickness absence as ethnic Norwegians; (4) residence time has a curve-linear effect (reversed U-shape) on sickness absence for most immigrant groups. We discuss the findings in relation to the reason for emigrating, health risks related to immigration, social exclusion and norms towards sickness absence.

T1  - A longitudinal examination of the role of stereotype threat and racial climate on college outcomes for minorities at elite institutions
AN  - 1417522215; 201331897
AB  - This paper employs hierarchical linear models to explore the long-term effects of stereotype threat on college outcomes for students in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen. Performance burden was negatively related to both grades and social satisfaction with college. Social satisfaction with college was also significantly impacted by students' perception of the campus racial climate. This paper examines the combined impact of performance burden, campus racial climate, cumulative GPA, and social life satisfaction early in college on 4 year graduation rates. Overall, while there are large initial differences in the likelihood of graduating on time for black and Hispanic students relative to whites, these differences are completely explained by assessments of campus racial climate, social life satisfaction, and grades. The findings suggest that interventions to reduce stereotype threat and improve the racial atmosphere on campus may go a long way towards reducing -- and in some cases eliminating -- disparities between racial/ethnic groups in college outcomes.

T1  - Housing Experiences of Turkish (Im)migrants in Berlin and Istanbul: Internal Differentiation and Segregation
AN  - 60337778; 201012026
AB  - This paper presents the findings of a comparative qualitative study of Turks who migrated to Istanbul from elsewhere in the country, and Turks who immigrated to Berlin. The main objective of the study is to describe and explain the segregation process affecting Turks in both cities. As the paper focuses on the process of segregation, the article follows the three basic stages along which the history of Turkish (im)migration to Germany and Istanbul has proceeded: the labour migrant stage, the family reunification stage and the settlement stage. Voices of (im)migrants are presented throughout the paper by reflecting their perceptions, values, experiences and dilemmas. The paper argues that internal differences within immigrant groups deserve more attention in order to better understand why some of them, despite being able to afford it, do not move out of concentration areas for better housing opportunities. In this context, the paper focuses on the internal cultural differentiation of Turkish migrants in Istanbul and Turkish immigrants in Berlin, with particular reference to their highly divergent religious understandings. We argue that conservatism-especially when it takes its roots from Islamism-has played an important role in shaping the residential preferences and choices of individuals.

T1  - Why Don't We Practice What We Preach? A Meta-Analytic Review of Religious Racism
AN  - 1928179681
AB  - A meta-analytic review of past research evaluated the link between religiosity and racism in the United States since the Civil Rights Act. Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to in-group members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.
