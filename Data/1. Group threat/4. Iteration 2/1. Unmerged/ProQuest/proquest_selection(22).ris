T1  - Predicting support for community corrections: Crime type and severity, and offender, observer, and victim characteristics
AN  - 2672269522
AB  - The aim of the current research was to examine the contribution of crime type and severity as well as offender, observer, and victim characteristics to prediction of perception of community correction (CC) as an appropriate punishment. We conducted a telephone survey among Israeli citizens. A random and representative sample of 573 respondents, aged 20 to 74, evaluated the seriousness of crime scenarios and the appropriateness of CC for each scenario. In different versions of crime scenarios, we manipulated offence type as well as offender and victim characteristics. The results of a logistic regression indicate that perceived lower crime severity, a crime that is not murder, older offender age, and being a secular observer are related with an increased likelihood of supporting community corrections. The discussion addresses these findings in the context of punitive goals (e.g., revenge, retribution), public perception of offender dangerousness, and social identity theory.

T1  - Privilege lost: How dominant groups react to shifts in cultural primacy and power: GPIR
AN  - 2652814894
AB  - As a function of their race, gender, class, and other social categories, long-standing privileges in social hierarchies have been afforded to some groups of people to the detriment of others. Recently, scholars have made considerable headway studying the social gains made by disadvantaged groups, including a better understanding of how relatively advantaged groups (e.g., White people; men) often pushback against and resist shifts in group-based power or prestige. The present body of work curates social psychological perspectives on the sense of privilege lost, the belief that one’s dominant group is losing ground to other groups. Here, we outline several dominant themes emerging from scholars in this field, including a better understanding of the psychological nature of group-based threat reactions, and for whom such demographic/power changes are deemed troubling, thus triggering pushback. We make recommendations for shaping future research on the perceived loss of group status and power.

T1  - “Be careful what you do”: How social threat influences social attention driven by reach-to-grasp movements
AN  - 2653430083
AB  - Social attention is the ability to share with social partners the attentional focus on an object and to orient attentional resources after observing others’ behaviors. In the present work, we analyzed whether social threat may influence social attention during the observation of social agents’ reach-to-grasp movements. In two experimental studies, we adopted a Posner-like paradigm: participants were required to classify neutral stimuli appearing in a congruent or incongruent position with the actor’s movement. Membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) and contextual cues (neutral vs. threatening objects) were manipulated. The results showed a robust action-cueing effect: responses to stimuli in a congruent position with the actor’s action were faster than responses to incongruent stimuli. Interestingly, we found a stronger effect for the threatening outgroup (i.e., Iraqi) than for the ingroup (i.e., Italian), especially in presence of menacing objects. No effects were found when observing the non-threatening outgroup (i.e., Japanese).

T1  - Yes, I have a disability. Does it prevent me from being a PE teacher? A qualitative approach from the point of view of future PE teachers and their families
AN  - 2620226349
AB  - Physical Education (PE) teachers are subject to a great deal of social stereotyping. The goal of the study is to analyze the main reasons and motivations of three future PE teachers (two females and one male) with motor disabilities to undertake the profession in the future. Their families and the teachers who have taught them also participate. The disabilities are an arm amputation, severe hip dysmetry and Tourette’s syndrome. These future teachers, under a reflective perspective, expose the reasons and motivations why they want to be PE teachers, specifying diversity of experiences in the past and how they would like to teach the subject in the future. The introduction discusses whether disability fits into the ideal body type of PE, delving into the theories of social identity [Tajfel & Turner, 1979. An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin & S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33–47). Brooks- Cole] and social desirability (Paulhus, 2002). A qualitative approach is used in which three categories (established prior to obtaining the results) of analysis are established: (a) Motivations for being a PE teacher; (b) Limitations and obstacles exercised by society; and (c) Professional identity and conception of PE. Interviews with participants and their families, narrative journals and discussion groups are the data collection instruments used. The results show how, despite the fact that the motivation of future teachers is high (want to be physical education teachers above any other profession), the social constraints they face in order to achieve their dream are diverse. These obstacles are manifested in derogatory comments and lack of infrastructure and adapted material to be able to practice. Families and teachers agree that there is still a long way to go to achieve inclusion, especially in the area of PE. This inclusion refers to the acceptance into the subject of all students, regardless of their physical and psychological characteristics. It is essential to continue researching about disability and PE, since it allows breaking down a variety of existing barriers about the beliefs that people with disabilities have about the limitations of teaching the subject.

T1  - Bureaucratic implementation practices and the making of Canada’s merit-based immigration policy
AN  - 2624032718
AB  - This article extends theories of how, in the mid-twentieth century, ‘merit-based’ immigration policies, which select immigrants based on individual human capital and social ties, replaced explicitly racist immigration policies that selected on national and racial group origins. It does so in reference to the historical Canadian case, where existing scholarship emphasises the role of macro and meso-level economic, cultural, and political factors in driving immigration policy change. Using a qualitative content analysis of unique archival data on admissions and deportation appeals, the article identifies high-level bureaucrats’ implementation practices as a micro-level mechanism of postwar immigration policy change. This mechanism allowed for low-risk policy experimentation and subsequently paved the way for a more systemic policy shift. The analysis also shows that individual-level assessments of traits like ‘merit’ were not designed to be ‘race free’ but emerged as a way of managing race, at the intersection of class and status. This gave the formal merit-based policy that later emerged a decidedly middle-class inflection. While focused on the historical Canadian case, the findings presented are relevant to broader debates about the role of immigration bureaucrats in policymaking and how race shapes nation-building under merit-based immigration policies.

T1  - The Salience of Perceived Societal Conflict in Europe: A 27 Country Study on the Development of a Measure for Generalized Conflict Thinking
AN  - 2594369547
AB  - Over the last two decades, European countries have struggled with several crises (e.g., the Great Recession, the refugee crisis) which had a tremendous impact on (some) societies. Typically, these crises were accompanied by divisive public discourses that rely heavily on a sharp and moralistic us-them distinction. Especially extreme right- and left-wing parties have adopted such conflict discourses and have gained much electoral support. Against this background, this paper has two objectives. First, data from the European Quality of Life Survey from 2003 to 2016 in 27 countries are used to provide a comprehensive overview of the salience of perceived societal conflicts between seven pairs of groups between countries and across time. We find substantial differences between countries and longitudinal trend variation in the salience of perceived societal conflict. For example, in Eastern European countries more economic conflict is perceived, while in Western European countries people perceive more cultural conflict between different ethnic and religious groups. Second, multigroup confirmatory factor analyses reveal that specific perceptions of conflict are structured by an underlying general orientation, generalized conflict thinking: people’s tendency to perceive society through the lens of conflict regardless of the specificity of these groups. The measure for generalized conflict thinking is metric equivalent across a large sample of countries. This demonstrates that generalized conflict thinking can be used as a social indicator for comparative research. In the conclusion we elaborate on the implications of our findings and develop a research agenda regarding generalized conflict thinking.

T1  - Good <i>Minzu</i> and bad Muslims: Islamophobia in China's state media
AN  - 2580778942
AB  - Since 2014, observers of Chinese society have noted an upsurge in Islamophobic sentiment among China's ethnic majority Han. China's Muslims, in particular those who identify as Hui and Uyghur, report an increase in harassment, both online and in person. This Islamophobic backlash occurs in conjunction with retrenchments by the Chinese state on the right to practice religion. What gives rise to this increase in bigotry? This pilot study examines official discourse about Islam through an inductive analysis of the presentation of Muslims in China's state media. Using a process of constant comparative analysis, I examine the state media's portrayal of Muslims in the flagship newspaper, The People's Daily. Drawing from a sample of 70 articles published between 2014 and 2018, I argue that the party's depiction of Muslim minorities in China emphasizes ethnic rather than religious identities, while coverage of global Islam emphasizes Islam as dangerous and associated with extremism. I contend that such depictions carry the unintended consequence of arousing suspicions about China's Muslims among Han.

T1  - Values and attitudes towards cultural diversity: Exploring alternative moderators of the value–attitude link: GPIR
AN  - 2573357344
AB  - We study relations of two value dimensions—self-enhancement versus self-transcendence and conservation versus openness to change—with attitudes to cultural diversity. We examine two potential moderators of the value–attitude link, the meaning and the level of cultural diversity. We operationalize the meaning as the perceived consequences of cultural diversity for attaining value-relevant goals. We hypothesize that the perceived consequences depend on a group’s status: majority versus minority and high versus low. We test these hypotheses on representative samples from 25 regions of Russia (N = 1,934). As hypothesized, the self-enhancement/self-transcendence link to attitude, though negative in all groups, was most negative in the low-status group. The conservation/openness link to attitude was negative for majority Russians, as in past research, but it was positive among minorities. Level of cultural diversity had no moderating effect. This study highlights the importance of group differences in the meaning of attitude objects for understanding attitude predictors.

However, no studies so far have been able to explore how this relationship changed following the European migration crisis due to a lack of recent comparative policy data. Using new MIPEX data, this is the first study to examine mechanisms underlying the policy-threat nexus following the European migration crisis, distinguishing between several strands of integration policies, and realistic and symbolic threat. To do so, we combine 2017 Eurobarometer data with 2017 Migrant Integration Policy data, resulting in a sample of 28,080 respondents nested in 28 countries. The analyses also control for economic conditions, outgroup size, and media freedom. Multilevel analyses indicate that respondents living in countries with more inclusive integration policies in general report lower realistic and symbolic threat. When investigating different policy strands, we find that inclusive policies regarding political participation and access to nationality for immigrants are associated with lower realistic and symbolic threat. We compare our findings to those from prior to the European migration crisis and discuss the potential role of this crisis in the policy-threat nexus.

T1  - 40 Years of Multiple Social Categorization: A Tool for Social Inclusivity
AN  - 2522250449
AB  - We review a 40-year corpus of research that we collectively name “Multiple Categorisation Theory” (MCT). From early illustrations using the minimal group paradigm, through a focus on how people cognitively represent social diversity, to recent models of outgroup “re-humanisation”, this work has revealed much about how we think about inclusivity, exclusion, and intergroup differences. We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical and practical implications of this research programme.

T1  - Social media, protest, & outrage communication in Ethiopia: toward fractured publics or pluralistic polity?
AN  - 2495802010
AB  - In 2018, Ethiopia experienced a tectonic political shift following the culmination of years of public outcry against the now defunct ruling party, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Protest groups, predominantly organized along ethnic identification, have used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to disseminate strategies, recruit members, and galvanize support. Anchored on theories of collective identity and moral outrage, this study investigates the role of social media platforms in mobilizing Ethiopians toward political reform during the protest and post-protest periods demarcated by the ascent of Abiy Ahmed as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Data generated from a mixed method approach consisting of an online survey and interviews indicate social media platforms played a crucial role by drawing Ethiopian youth to participate in political discourse, empowering formerly marginalized groups to influence policy, and fostering ingroup cultural/political cohesion. However, evidence indicates participation opportunities created by social media platforms also brought apprehension including the rise of outrage communication as manifested by inflammatory expressions, hate speech, and political extremism. By proposing outrage communication as a viable construct that captures this phenomenon, I argue, in the context of a polity embodying highly heterogeneous and competing collective identities – ethnic or otherwise – such as Ethiopia, social media platforms are likely to increase ingroup political participation but chronically diminish outgroup engagement.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Cross-group friendships, the irony of harmony, and the social construction of “discrimination”
AN  - 2390692846
AB  - Cross-group friendships are often assumed to be a panacea to intergroup conflict. However, the irony of harmony hypothesis suggests that friendships can have negative consequences for collective action and social change. We complement this research with accounts of cross-group friendship, using interviews and focus groups with minority (African-Caribbean and/ or gay) and majority (White and/ or heterosexual) participants (n = 54). Participants repeatedly deployed “friendship” as an idealized category such that what happened within friendship could not be constructed as discrimination. Majority participants said that anything that happened within friendship could only be a mistake/ misunderstanding that would be easy to rectify. Minority participants struggled to reconcile the category entitlements of friendship with the problematic experiences that they described, but constructing such experiences as “discrimination” presented practical, moral, and rhetorical difficulties. Harmonious cross-group friendship may therefore require that minorities become tolerant to discrimination, while simultaneously enabling majorities to warrant (ill-informed) claims.

T1  - What children want to know about in‐ and out‐groups, and how knowledge affects their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2388834772
AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out‐groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3‐ to 4‐ and 5‐ to 6‐ year‐old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in‐ and out‐group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in‐group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out‐group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out‐group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out‐group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out‐group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3‐ to 4‐year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out‐group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them.

T1  - When integration policies shape the impact of intergroup contact on threat perceptions: a multilevel study across 20 European countries
AN  - 2376776526
AB  - There is ample evidence of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact in reducing negative attitudes towards immigrants. Although the valuable role of institutional support, one of the initial optimal conditions for contact, has been demonstrated, the impact of actual immigration integration policies, as a manifestation of institutional support, remains unknown. In the current study, we examine how country-level migrant integration policies, assessed by the MIPEX indicator, shape the relationship between everyday contact and threat perceptions associated to immigration. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with European Social Survey Round 7 data from 20 European countries (N = 32,093 citizens). Everyday contact was related to less symbolic and realistic threat perceptions. Moreover, on the country level, tolerant policies (a high MIPEX score) were related to higher everyday contact and lower symbolic threat perceptions. Confirming that institutional support facilitates the effects of contact, a cross-level interaction revealed that the link between everyday contact and symbolic threat was stronger in high rather than low MIPEX countries. The pattern of results was partially replicated when contact quality and cross-group friendships were assessed, though integration policies did not moderate the effects of these intergroup contact measures. These findings extend the body of multilevel contact research and are crucial for application as they show that integration policies have the potential to guide national majority members’ perceptions regarding immigrants.

T1  - "They are all alike": When negative minority outgroups are generalized onto superordinate inclusive outgroups
AN  - 2350370467
AB  - Two studies investigated outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, addressing whether members of negatively perceived minority outgroups are perceived as prototypical of larger partially-inclusive outgroups and whether this tendency is enhanced under intergroup threat. Both experimental studies were conducted with Italian undergraduate participants. Experiment 1 (N = 186) tested whether Roma are generalized onto (i.e., perceived as prototypical of) Romanians to a higher extent under intergroup realistic and symbolic threat than under no-threat. It also explored the direction of the phenomenon and its underlying mechanism. Experiment 2 (N = 90) provided additional evidence on the effect of threat on such generalization phenomenon considering a different pair of groups (Islamic terrorists, Arabs) and employing a less blatant measure of generalization. Overall, these studies provided consistent evidence of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization, clarifying the conditions of its occurrence. These results contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon of outgroup-to-outgroup generalization and of its impact on outgroup perception and prejudice.

T1  - Dual identification, multicultural identity styles, and intergroup evaluations: Some preliminary findings
AN  - 2317027068
AB  - The current study examines dual identification (i.e., identification with one's ethnic and national cultures) and cultural identity styles (i.e., the ways in which one negotiates ethnic and national identities) as predictors of intergroup evaluations in a sample of 228 Chinese New Zealanders. It was hypothesized that dual identification predicts more positive ingroup and outgroup evaluations, but also more ingroup bias. Furthermore, we expected that the Hybrid Identity Style (HIS), which reflects blending ethnic and national identities, is linked to positive ingroup and outgroup evaluations, but that the Alternating Identity Style (AIS), which involves shifting between these identities depending on the circumstances, is associated with negative ingroup and outgroup evaluations. We also predicted that HIS moderates the link between dual identification and ingroup bias. As expected, multiple regression analysis indicated that dual identification predicted more positive ingroup evaluation and greater ingroup bias, and HIS moderated these effects. A high level of HIS buffered the influence of dual identification on ingroup bias. HIS was positively, and AIS was negatively associated with both ingroup and outgroup evaluations. The results suggest that HIS is a promising route to positive intergroup relations.

T1  - Health inequality implications from a qualitative study of experiences of poverty stigma in Scotland
AN  - 2298542075
AB  - Rationale: Individuals living in Scotland's most deprived communities experience a higher burden of morbidity and early mortality than those living in more affluent areas. Experiences of poverty-based stigma may be one psychosocial mechanism through which socioeconomic position influences health, although there is little available data on this issue from a Scottish perspective. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify which aspects of poverty stigma are particularly salient to individuals with lived experience of poverty, and may therefore contribute to health inequalities. Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with 39 individuals with experience of living on low incomes in Scotland in order to explore their experiences and perceptions of poverty stigma. Results: Five main themes were identified, reflecting aspects of poverty stigma operating at various structural, public and individual levels: media representations of poverty; negative encounters with social security systems; perceived public attitudes regarding poverty in Scotland; lowered self-esteem and internalisation of negative attitudes, and; emotional responses to stigma. Conclusion: These dimensions of stigma potentially influence public health and health inequalities in Scotland, although future research will be necessary to quantify these and estimate their relationships with health outcomes.

T1  - Contextual factors and prejudice at the beginning of the migrant influx: The Moroccan case in Seville, Spain
AN  - 2296289427
AB  - Studies addressing contextual factors associated with anti‐immigrant prejudice have focused on out‐group size and rapid demographic changes in receiving locations. However, the territorial concentration and distribution of ethnic minorities at a local and intraurban level has received little attention. We analyse the relationship between emerging territorial concentration points—alongside other contextual variables—by Moroccans and receiving society's growing prejudice towards them in a city experiencing the start of a migrant influx. We combine survey and census data from five Seville districts (southern Spain). Our results show how rapid changes in the general population's ethnic composition, coupled with Moroccan and economic migrants' territorial concentration, correlate strongly with negative attitudes towards Moroccans at this early stage. However, a weaker relationship between the immigrant percentage and degree of prejudice by the receiving group is observed. We also discuss guidelines for ensuring good, local diversity management to prevent socioterritorial fragmentation in multicultural cities.

T1  - Are today’s youth more tolerant? Trends in tolerance among young people in Britain
AN  - 2170172834
AB  - Attitudes towards social groups that have traditionally been marginalised or discriminated against have changed markedly in Britain over the past three decades. This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people’s attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.

T1  - Whither the diversity bargain?
AN  - 1930436593
AB  - In Natasha Warikoo's account, the "diversity bargain" is widespread among white elite American college students. This bargain is tentative support for preferences for underrepresented minorities in college admissions, conditioned on the admitted minority students providing white students with multicultural experiences that signal elite cosmopolitanism. This essay reviews three possible explanations for the pervasiveness of the diversity bargain: campus experiences with the benefits of diversity; socialization into expectations that elites give lip service to the benefits of diversity; and Warikoo's methodological and analytical choices.

T1  - The Benefits and Challenges of Health Disparities and Social Stress Frameworks for Research on Sexual and Gender Minority Health
AN  - 1940955912
AB  - Research on the health of sexual and gender minority populations has been predominantly framed within the context of health disparities and social stress. Findings produced from research employing health disparities and social stress frameworks have spurred significant advancements in basic and applied science on sexual and gender minority health, and have been useful in arguing for the removal of discriminatory social policies. Critiques of these frameworks suggest their dominant role in the research literature risks an artificially narrow portrayal of relevant lived experience, and further pathologizes and stigmatizes sexual and gender minority populations. Methodological challenges involve the measurement of explanatory variables within comparative research designs. By taking stock of these benefits and challenges, suggestions can be made for future research designed to maximize the benefits of health disparities and social stress frameworks for understanding and improving the health of sexual and gender minority populations in ways that are responsive to critiques while recognizing variability in lived experience.

T1  - The Intergroup Context of Environmental Education and Approaches to Facilitate Collaboration
AN  - 1928324707
AB  - An exploratory qualitative study examined how collaborations are fostered between newly formed small groups, comprised of individuals holding distinct in-group identities and differing in status. The study context was the environmental education (EE) field known to represent subgroups of educators using unique practices. Participants were environmental educators in a small group in each of three U.S. states, aiming to create inclusive collaborative partnerships. Insights from social identity theory and intergroup contact theory guided the analytical framework. Results highlighted the collaborative potential between professionals representing two subgroups: established EE and a relatively unknown community-focused EE. Insights on the process suggested employing strategies that respected subgroup differences in EE approaches and discussed them openly, enabled understanding of complementary ways to achieve a shared goal. Status differences between the subgroups seemed to influence how members of each group approached the partnership. Implications for using inclusive efforts to bring people together from diverse backgrounds are discussed.

T1  - Understanding the gap between reality and expectation: Local social engagement and ethnic concentration
AN  - 1923170558
AB  - It is widely known that there is a strong relationship between local ethnic concentration and local social engagement. This article attempts to take a step forward by analysing the gap between the real and the expected local social engagement and its association with local ethnic concentration. Understanding this gap may assist policy makers with better urban planning aiming for high social cohesion, particularly in those cities with high ethnic concentrations. Using the case of the Netherlands, this article finds a positive association between the real and the expected local social engagement, but this is higher for native Dutch people than for immigrants (i.e. Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans). This article also finds that as local ethnic concentration increases, Moroccans and Turks seem to meet their own expectations, but this effect is stronger for Moroccans. This is likely to indicate that an increase in local ethnic concentration assists Moroccans and Turks to maintain their cultural traditions, as they are able to derive benefits from each other and offer support to one another within a locality.

T1  - Hostile Public Effect: Minority Status Mobilizing Political Participation
AN  - 2502808685
AB  - This study theorizes and tests the hostile public effect, according to which citizens who (a) actually are and/or (b) merely see themselves in a minority should be more participatory than those holding the dominant opinion. This study also tests whether it is citizens’ perceptions or their actual status that matters to political engagement. Furthermore, the hostile public effect is tested across three distinct issues and two participatory forms. Drawing on a nationally representative survey (N = 2,500) conducted in Spain, this study finds evidence for the mobilizing hostile public effect, with citizens who are actual minorities when it comes to their positions on abortion and immigration being more participatory than actual majorities. In turn, perceived minority or majority status does not matter to political engagement. These findings have various theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for public opinion scholarship.

T1  - Same-Sex Sexuality and Educational Attainment: The Pathway to College
AN  - 1865249450
AB  - Research finds lower levels of academic performance among sexual minority high school students, but some studies suggest sexual minorities have higher levels of educational attainment in adulthood. To further our understanding of how and why sexual orientation is associated with educational success, this study turns attention to the pathways to college completion, examining points along educational trajectories in which sexual minorities fall behind or surpass their heterosexual peers. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we find that sexual minority women are less likely than women with no same-sex sexuality to complete college, in part due to their high school performance and transition into college. Men who experience same-sex sexuality only in adolescence struggle in high school, but men who experience same-sex sexuality for the first time in adulthood are more likely to earn a college degree than men who do not experience same-sex sexuality.

T1  - No Longer "Bound for the Promised Land": African Americans' Religious Experiences in the Reversal of the Great Migration
AN  - 1872753531
AB  - This study examines the religious experiences of African Americans who make up the reversal of the Great Migration. While scholars have studied the role of religion in the Great Migration, we know less about how religion matters in the movement's reversal. I use the framework of conjunctural action to elaborate the role of spirituality and religious institutions among contemporary black southbound migrants. Drawing on 127 qualitative interviews with black interregional migrants to Charlotte, North Carolina, I show how some blacks interpret their moves through faith and draw on ties to religious institutions for support. But not all black migrants interpret their moves through faith or seek support from religious institutions. These migrants' lack of engagement often reflects their concerns about intra-group marginalization rather than an absence of spiritual belief. These findings illuminate micro-level processes of internal migration, and they show continuities but also changing dynamics in African American religious life.

T1  - When a majority becomes a minority: Essentialist intergroup stereotyping in an inverted power differential
AN  - 1865121623
AB  - This study is on the relationship between a dominant nominal Lithuanian majority and a Polish minority in regions with either a straight dominance of the majority or with a high proportion of minority members, who outnumber the national majority. Compared to 'normal' regions, the latter situation creates an inverted power differential that we expect to have an impact on how the two groups essentialize their own and the other group's ethnic identity, how they stereotype the out-group and how they cope with the perceived change in power balance by more or less disparaging the others. We analysed the discourse in eight focus group discussions with members of both groups comprising a total of 66 participants. As expected, the nominal minority exhibited a tendency to self-essentialize more than the majority in general. Members of the Lithuanian majority that was locally outnumbered by the minority also self-essentialized but to a lesser degree and additionally used marked arguments of in-group favouritism at the Poles' expense in their discourse. Members of the unambiguous majority were the most 'politically correct' participants by conspicuously favouring a non-generalising and anti-essentialist conversation. The findings are discussed in terms of inter-group relations and implications for politics.

T1  - Health Status and Risk Behaviors of Sexual Minorities Among Chinese Adolescents: A School-Based Survey
AN  - 1858768193
AB  - This study aimed to examine the association between sexual orientation and health disparities among a stratified random sample of 3776 secondary students in Hong Kong. The prevalence of homosexuality and bisexuality were 1.5% and 2.6% in boys and 1.8% and 3.7% in girls, respectively. A total of 10.7% of boys and 8.8% of girls were unsure of their sexual orientation. Homosexual and bisexual boys reported poorer physical and mental health than their heterosexual peers. Homosexual and bisexual boys were more likely to engage in smoking, frequent drinking, and vaginal sex and be subjected to sexually transmitted disease and sexual victimization. However, lesbian and bisexual girls were less likely to engage in risky health behaviors except for smoking and being subjected to sexual victimization. There is a gender-specific problem that may warrant prevention and intervention programs to address the unique health issues facing homosexual and bisexual adolescents in Hong Kong.

T1  - White Racial Socialization: Progressive Fathers on Raising "Antiracist" Children
AN  - 1878386176
AB  - For the past 30 years, the definition of racial socialization has referred to how parents prepare children of color to flourish within a society structured by white supremacy. Drawing on ethnographic interviews with eight white affluent fathers, this study explores fathers' participation in white racial socialization processes. The article focuses on fathers who identify as "progressive" and examines the relationship between fathers' understandings of what it means to raise an "antiracist" child, the explicit and implicit lessons of racial socialization that follow from these understandings, and hegemonic whiteness. Findings illustrate how these fathers understand their role as a white father, how their attempts to raise antiracist children both challenge and reinforce hegemonic whiteness, and what role race and class privilege play in this process.

T1  - “Oil and Water”? Latino-white Relations and Symbolic Integration in a Changing California
AN  - 2406943817
AB  - Existing research on race relations between racial/ethnic groups in the United States highlights how personal contact can lead to increased harmony or conflict between groups and may reduce intergroup prejudice. This study engages this literature and draws from more than 20 months of ethnography and 66 interviews in a Spanish/English dual-language school in Los Angeles to qualitatively examine Latino-white relations in diverse settings. Interactions between Latino and white adults of varying class statuses are characterized by politeness and civility, yet parents segregate within the school and rarely form meaningful cross-racial relationships that transcend the campus. Despite regular interpersonal contact, a shared goal of bilingualism, and shared class status for some, divisions between Latino and white parents persist, and interactions between them are characterized by what the author terms symbolic integration. Symbolic integration refers to polite, but surface-level, interactions between racial/ethnic groups that are enjoyable, voluntary, and additive. This type of integration nuances our understanding of race relations and elucidates how sustained regular contact and the absence of negative racial stereotypes do not ensure lessened racial stratification between racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - The Impact of Unpunished Hate Crimes: When Derogating the Victim Extends into Derogating the Group
AN  - 1812607487
AB  - Just world research has shown that observers derogate victims more for their misfortunes if the perpetrator is not harshly punished (Lerner in J Personal Soc Psychol 1(4):355-360, 1980 ). However, few studies have investigated minority group derogation as a just world preservation strategy after instances of intergroup harm-doing. This study is among the first to demonstrate the derogation of both individual victims and of the victim's minority group experimentally, using the context of a racist hate crime in Australia. In the present experiment, participants (N = 110) read a news article describing a hate crime against an Aboriginal Australian teenager and were informed that the perpetrator was harshly or leniently punished (secure vs. justice threat condition). Our results show that in the justice threat condition, participants not only derogated the individual Aboriginal Australian victim more after his death, they also expressed greater racism toward the victim's group. An indirect effect of the justice threat condition on modern racism via individual victim derogation was observed, along with moderating effects of individual differences in belief in a just world. These findings provide support for the alarming hypothesis that racist hate crimes are not only the manifestation of a racist society, but may also bolster racial prejudices if leniently treated. The results highlight the important role of political and judicial authorities, whose response or non-response to a hate crime can exacerbate or ameliorate existing prejudices.

T1  - City racial composition as a predictor of African American food deserts
AN  - 1837057667
AB  - Extending Small and McDermott's 'conditional perspective', Blalock's minority competition theory is used to explain how the relationship between African Americans and the number of supermarkets in a zip code depends on the city in which it resides. The 2010 American Community Survey and ZIP Business pattern data are examined with hierarchical general linear models to explore whether the previously observed negative relationship between the percentage of African Americans and the number of supermarkets in a zip code depends on the percentage of African Americans in the city. The results show that the relationship between the percentage of African Americans and the number of supermarkets depends on the percentage of African Americans in the city in the U-shaped pattern predicted by minority competition theory. Applications of minority competition to other theories of the unequal distribution of resources in cities are discussed.

T1  - Human rights: Protecting sexual minorities or reinforcing the boundaries of 'the closet'?
AN  - 1834955081
AB  - In this article we problematise the fact that human rights legislation, whether intentionally or otherwise, reinforces binary categories such as 'heterosexual' or 'homosexual'. This form of 'othering' highlights the incongruence between what the legislation offers and sexual minorities' lived experiences. We argue that human rights thus constitute a double-edged sword that may discourage 'coming out'. Our critique of human rights is based on the findings of a research project in which 1 086 pre-service teachers across six national public tertiary universities in South Africa participated in a survey and/or in focus-group discussions (FGDs). The survey findings suggested that participants see human rights as implying freedom, dignity and equality for all, irrespective of sexual identity. Yet, a closer analysis of the data revealed that gay and lesbian participants do not necessarily experience the freedom, equality and dignity entrenched in human rights documents. An analysis of the data from the FGDs supported this notion as it revealed homophobic 'othering' attitudes on the side of pre-service teachers. Finally, we reflect on the ways in which the boundaries of 'the closet' have been reinforced through the 'othering' of sexual selfhood and consider how pre-service teachers grapple with some of the complexities surrounding issues of sexual diversity in education contexts.

T1  - Partisanship, Dysfunction, and Racial Fears: The New Normal in Health Care Policy?
AN  - 1818672624
AB  - Partisan politics snarled both the passage and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This essay examines partisanship's effects on health policy and asks whether the ACA experience was an exception or the new political normal. Partisanship itself has been essential for American democracy, but American institutions were not designed to handle its current form -- ideologically pure, racially sorted, closely matched parties playing by "Gingrich rules" before a partisan media. The new partisanship injects three far-reaching changes into national health policy: an unprecedented lack of closure, a decline in the traditional political arts of compromise and bargaining, and a failure to define and debate alternative health policies. We can get a better sense of how far partisanship reaches by turning to state health policies. The highly charged national debate has migrated into some of the states; others retain the traditional politics of compromise and problem solving. There are preliminary indications that the difference lies in the dynamics of race and ethnicity. [web URL: http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/41/4/827.abstract]

T1  - Needed Interventions to Reduce Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Health
AN  - 1818672610
AB  - Large racial/ethnic and socioeconomic status (SES) differences in health persist in the United States. Eliminating these health disparities is a public health challenge of our time. This article addresses what is needed for social and behavioral interventions to be successful. We draw on important insights for reducing social inequalities in health that David Mechanic articulated more than a decade ago in his article "Disadvantage, Inequality, and Social Policy." We begin by outlining the challenge that interventions that have the potential to improve health at the population level can widen social inequalities in health. Next, given that there are racial differences in SES at every level of SES, we review research on race/ethnicity-related aspects of social experience that can contribute to racial inequalities in SES and health. We then explore what is needed for social and behavioral interventions to be successful in addressing disparities and consider the significance of race/ethnicity in designing and developing good policies to address this added dimension of inequality. We conclude that there is a pressing need to develop a scientific research agenda to identify how to build and sustain the political will needed to create policy to eliminate racial/ethnic health disparities.

T1  - Majority Educators in a United States Minority/Immigrant Public School District: The Case of Garden City, Kansas
AN  - 1797683194
AB  - Increasingly, immigrants are settling in rural "new destinations," where low-wage, low-skilled jobs have been created as part of a broad restructuring of the United States economy. This trend has spurred not only the rapid growth of many small towns but also their demographic, linguistic, and cultural transformation. Nowhere is this more evident than in Garden City, Kansas, a micropolitan community Stull has studied for three decades. This changing geography of immigration is manifest in its public schools, where four of five students are members of so-called minorities, many of them recent immigrants or refugees, and three of four are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Studying educators' experiences in this unique district can enrich the otherwise generic notions of diversity that so often inform teacher educators and educational policy makers. This article is based on a five-month ethnographic study involving participant observation and in-depth interviews with administrators and teachers in Garden City's eighteen public schools. It also draws upon documents and interviews from previous research in 1988-1990. This in-depth, diachronic study offers valuable insights for other new destination micropolitan communities and their schools.

T1  - Assessing the Impact of a Media-based Intervention to Prevent Intergroup Violence and Promote Positive Intergroup Relations in Burundi
AN  - 1784567762
AB  - The present study (N=1074) examined the impact of a theory-driven media intervention aimed at violence prevention and intergroup reconciliation in Burundi. We used a novel methodology utilizing audio-based surveys to assess attitudes related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation among community members. We conducted a propensity score analysis to estimate the causal effects of the intervention by examining differences between listeners and non-listeners of the radio dramas. The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, in-group superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood). However, listeners and non-listeners did not differ in obedience toward leaders or historical perspective taking; and the results for active bystandership, one of the main foci of the intervention, were mixed. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of the intervention sometimes depends on listeners' personal experiences of victimization. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Racial Minority Women and Criminal Justice Responses to Domestic Violence
AN  - 1783932664
AB  - Racialized minority women's experiences with Canadian specialized criminal justice responses to domestic violence have seldom been documented. Informed by an intersectionality framework, this qualitative study presents the struggles of 14 racial minority women from three Canadian cities and their experiences with the police and criminal court's response to their partner's acts of domestic violence. The results focus on how well specialized criminal justice responses address the needs of these women and protect them from further violence. Factors that facilitate or deter these women from approaching the criminal justice system for help are highlighted. The implications of these women's narratives for criminal justice responses to domestic violence are discussed.

T1  - Wealth Inequality in Black and White: Cultural and Structural Sources of the Racial Wealth Gap
AN  - 1771600577
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Wealth Using data from the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, this research examines competing and complementary cultural and structural explanations of the sources of racial differences in wealth. We use OLS regression and quantile regression to identify the major individual-level sources of wealth differences between African Americans and whites. Whites have more favorable wealth characteristics than do African Americans on all of the variables in the analysis: gender of household head, bankruptcies, spending patterns, stock ownership, business ownership, home ownership, inheritance, educational attainment, income, occupation, age, and number of children. Cultural factors, having a female-headed family, spending patterns, and inheritance account for little of the racial wealth gap. Racial differences in income, stock ownership, and business ownership account for much of the explained racial wealth gap. Moreover, compared with whites, African Americans receive significantly lower wealth returns to education, age, income, stock ownership, and business ownership. We discuss the implications of our findings.

T1  - Prejudice and paranoia: a comparative study of antisemitism and Sinophobia in turn-of-the-century Britain
AN  - 1784144946
AB  - Renshaw examines in comparative terms two of the most virulent manifestations of racial prejudice in early twentieth-century British society. The language of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the Edwardian period and the years preceding the First World War, the similarities and differences in the ways that these two forms of prejudice were articulated, and the overlap between them are analysed. Five strands of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese sentiment and action are discussed. The first examines how international manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia, suspicions aimed at Jews and Chinese as transnational diasporic communities, and perceptions of these minorities, through Russian pogroms, the Boxer Rebellion in China and the post-Boer War economic situation in South Africa, were framed in narratives of victimhood and aggression. Second, the transnational and colonial circuits of racialized discourse and the relationship between periphery and metropole are considered, as are divergences in the articulation of anti-Jewish and anti-Chinese prejudice. The third strand investigates the use of the language of 'invasion', used by both the political right and the left in discussing Jewish and Chinese immigration and economic activity in Britain, with Chinese employment in British industries (in this period particularly as sailors on British ships) framed in the context of a demographic 'Asiatic' takeover of European societies. The fourth strand looks at the intersection of racial prejudice and sexual and social angst, the visceral association of immigrant groups with dirt and disease, and the sexual threat that racist and antisemitic literature attributed to Jews and Chinese. Finally, physical manifestations of antisemitism and Sinophobia in the period and the racial violence that occurred in Cardiff and Tredegar in 1911 will be described and placed in context. The article positions Edwardian antisemitism and Sinophobia as a transitory stage in the evolution of British racism: a bridge between the separate domestic and colonial forms of prejudice present in late Victorian discourse, and the new manifestations of racism located in British cities and ports, but aimed at non-white minorities, that emerged in the interwar period.

T1  - Socioeconomic Diversity Among African Immigrants in the United States: An Intra-African Immigrant Comparison
AN  - 1760244773
AB  - Recent studies on Black immigrants in the USA report higher than average socioeconomic and educational attainment for African immigrants. Based on an intra-African immigrant comparison, we examine the generalizability of this finding to African groups of differing countries and regions using data from the 1990 and 2000 5 % U.S. census Integrated Public Use Microdata Samples (IPUMS). We specifically ask whether hourly earnings of African immigrants vary by region of origin. Results of our analyses reveal that sending region is an important determinant of variations in hourly earnings among African immigrants. Also, data indicate that both race and gender are significantly associated with earning outcomes; with the earnings of males and whites significantly higher than those of females and blacks. We discuss these findings in the context of the so-called "black immigrant success story."

T1  - LESS ALTRUISM, MORE RACISM: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POSITIVE DEVIANCE AND RACIAL BIAS
AN  - 1899013075
AB  - The topics of racism, prejudice, and discrimination remain important issues within society, significantly impact individuals' lives in the United States, and assess continued bias within the social structure of society. Within the field of deviance, there remains continued research on the topic of positive deviance or altruism, which assesses an individuals' level of selflessness. However, there is presently no research which combines the topics of racial bias with the topic of positive deviance. This study examines the relationship of altruism relative to the study of racial bias using secondary data analysis from the 2002 General Social Survey. This data suggests there is a weak inverse relationship between racial bias and level of altruism. Individuals who are low on prejudicial attitudes tend to be higher on altruism, while individuals who are high on prejudicial attitudes tend to be low on altruism. This suggests these two approaches can be examined within the context of each other, which has not been considered within the academic research before.

T1  - Liberals and Pseudoliberals: Psychological Profiles
AN  - 1885893477
AB  - The article recognizes that liberalism is unpopular in contemporary Russia. The author believes that what is really unpopular is not true liberalism but its pseudoliberal "mutation." The main differences between the liberals and pseudoliberals are the interpretation of freedom, the attitude toward patriotism and morality, the basic ideologems, the style of thinking, way of life, the correlation between principles and interests, etc. The author formulates the main tasks that need to be tackled to restore a positive attitude toward liberalism in our country and predicts that the confrontation between true and pseudoliberalism may in the coming years become a major arena of ideological battles.

T1  - Redressing anti-imperial amnesia
AN  - 1774331794
AB  - Discussing the essence of reparative history, the author articulates the need to go beyond an examination of the impact of colonialism (for good or ill) or a simplistic inclusion of cultural minorities into the national story. Instead she urges an examination of the agency and influence of peripheries' struggles -- rebellions and resistance in the colonies -- such as the Haitian revolution, the Sepoy Mutiny, the Morant Bay Uprising, the Urabi Revolt on the metropole itself. How did they shape British domestic criticism of empire and ultimately ideas about liberty and independence? Where, she asks, is the acknowledgement of the agency of those who struggled against empire and slavery in present day debates about what constitutes British values.

T1  - "A Hindu is white although he is black": Hindu Alterity and the Performativity of Religion and Race between the United States and the Caribbean
AN  - 1758308625
AB  - This essay uses the controversies surrounding the enigmatic Ismet Ali, a yogi working in Chicago and New York in the 1920s, to illuminate the complexities of how the performativity of religion and race are interrelated. I examine several moments in which Ali's "authenticity" as Indian is brought into doubt to open up larger questions regarding the global flows of colonial knowledge, racial tropes, and groups of people between India, the United States, and the Caribbean. I explore the ways in which, in the early twentieth-century United States, East Indian "authenticity" only became legible via identificatory practices that engaged with and adapted orientalized stereotypes. The practices of the yogi persona and its sartorial stylings meant to signify "East Indianness" in the United States, particularly the donning of a turban and beard, were one mode through which both South Asian and African Americans repurposed "Hindoo" stereotypes as models for self-formation. By taking on "Hindoo" identities, peoples of color could circumvent the U.S. black/white racial binary and the violence of Jim Crow. This act of racial passing was also an act of religious passing. However, the ways in which identities had to and could be performed changed with context as individuals moved across national and colonial boundaries.

T1  - Sentencing and State-Level Racial and Ethnic Contexts
AN  - 1765639203
AB  - Sentencing studies have incorporated social context in studying sentencing decisions, but to date the bulk of prior work has focused almost exclusively on county context. An unresolved question is whether there also may be state-level effects on sentencing. Drawing from the minority threat perspective, we examine (1) whether state-level racial and ethnic contexts affect sentencing, (2) whether this effect amplifies the effect of county-level racial and ethnic contexts on sentencing, and (3) whether the interaction of county-level and state-level contextual effects is greater for minorities than for whites. Analysis of State Court Processing Statistics and other data indicates that state-level racial and ethnic contexts are associated with sentencing outcomes and that this effect may differ by outcome (e.g., incarceration versus sentence length) and by type of context (e.g., racial or ethnic). The study's findings and their implications are discussed.

T1  - The ascent of man: Theoretical and empirical evidence for blatant dehumanization
AN  - 1767330543; 201605571
AB  - Dehumanization is a central concept in the study of intergroup relations. Yet although theoretical and methodological advances in subtle, 'everyday' dehumanization have progressed rapidly, blatant dehumanization remains understudied. The present research attempts to refocus theoretical and empirical attention on blatant dehumanization, examining when and why it provides explanatory power beyond subtle dehumanization. To accomplish this, we introduce and validate a blatant measure of dehumanization based on the popular depiction of evolutionary progress in the 'Ascent of Man.' We compare blatant dehumanization to established conceptualizations of subtle and implicit dehumanization, including infrahumanization, perceptions of human nature and human uniqueness, and implicit associations between ingroup-outgroup and human-animal concepts. Across 7 studies conducted in 3 countries, we demonstrate that blatant dehumanization is (a) more strongly associated with individual differences in support for hierarchy than subtle or implicit dehumanization, (b) uniquely predictive of numerous consequential attitudes and behaviors toward multiple outgroup targets, (c) predictive above prejudice, and (d) reliable over time. Finally, we show that blatant-but not subtle-dehumanization spikes immediately after incidents of real intergroup violence and strongly predicts support for aggressive actions like torture and retaliatory violence (after the Boston Marathon bombings and Woolwich attacks in England). This research extends theory on the role of dehumanization in intergroup relations and intergroup conflict and provides an intuitive, validated empirical tool to reliably measure blatant dehumanization.

T1  - Representative Bureaucracy: Understanding the Correlates of the Lagging Progress of Diversity in Policing
AN  - 1945405555
AB  - The domination of policing by White males has long been considered a threat to the legitimacy of the profession, as police agencies have struggled with attracting, retaining, and promoting women and minorities within their agencies for decades. Female and minority representation are hardly stable across agencies with some agencies employing no women or people of color, while others are more representative of the communities they serve. Using a national sample of 1,478 police jurisdictions, this study further explores the correlates of diversity of women and racial minorities using a framework informed by representative bureaucracy theory. Findings suggest that the same factors are not predictive of representation of women and racial minorities.

T1  - Multiculturalism as the Normative Context of Immigrant Reception: Somali Immigrant Inclusion in Lewiston, Maine
AN  - 1784151141
AB  - Drawing on data gathered through ethnographic fieldwork, I examine the process of normative incorporation as it occurs through the establishment of group recognition and representation among a new immigrant group settling in a new immigrant destination. I argue that Somali immigrant incorporation in the small, white American, new destination city of Lewiston, Maine was characterised by (1) the recognition of and partnership with Somali organisations and individuals who might represent the Somali community; (2) tensions between the assumed homogeneity of the Somali community and the reality of limited group cohesiveness; and (3) declining concerns about the authentic leadership position of representative organisations and increasing interest in working with an organisation that embodied the ideals of multiculturalism. I show that these organisational struggles shaped the development of a public, secular Somaliness that fit the parameters of the mainstream and undercut attention to practical challenges of Somali immigrant incorporation. My observations provide insight into the multicultural context of immigrant reception in other locations and among other immigrant groups.

T1  - An Exploration of Racial Considerations in Partnered Fathers' Involvement in Bringing Up Their Mixed-/Multi-Race Children in Britain and New Zealand
AN  - 1727672340
AB  - This article considers how partnered fathers' involvement may be shaped by their understandings of the salience and impact of their children's racial belonging where fathers do not share the same race as their (biological) children. We draw on findings from a small-scale study of fathers with a partner from a different racial background living in Britain and New Zealand, to consider their involvement with their mixed or multi-racial children. Bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve White fathers in thinking about issues that they would not necessarily otherwise have to consider. It could, for example, mean that they supported their children 's access to minority cultural knowledge and challenge racism. Equally, bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve fathers from racial minorities in thinking about racial considerations in different ways. Notably they may transmit racial pride and cultured history to help their children deal with prejudice from the father's own minority ethnic group as well as racism from Whites.

T1  - Genetic Determinism, Technology Optimism, and Race: Views of the American Public
AN  - 1705979006
AB  - We begin with a typology of Americans' understanding of the links between genetic inheritance and racial or ethnic groups. The typology has two dimensions: one running from genetic determinism to social construction, and the other from technology optimism to technology pessimism. Construing each dimension as a dichotomy enables four distinct political perspectives on the possibilities for reducing racial inequality in the United States through genomics. We then use a new public opinion survey to analyze Americans' use of the typology. Survey respondents who perceive that some phenotypes are more prevalent in one group than another due to genetic factors are disproportionately technology optimists. Republicans and Democrats are equally likely to hold that set of views, as are self-identified blacks, whites, and Latinos. The article discusses the findings and speculates about alternative interpretations of the fact that partisanship and group identity do not differentiate Americans in their views of the links between genetic inheritance and racial inequality.

T1  - Ethnic Income Disparities in Israel
AN  - 1667948779; 201509600
AB  - This article analyses income inequality in Israel and the role of ethnicity in creating or explaining it. It shows that in spite of relatively large 'raw' disparities in mean incomes across the ethnic groups, when controlling for other non-ethnic factors it is not generally the case that Arabs underperform in the Israeli labour markets compared with Jews, and in some cases Arabs outperform Jews, especially for men. Returns on education also do not appear to be lower for Arabs, other things being equal. In spite of the stereotypes, Ashkenazim generally do not outperform Mizrahim, or at most do so to a very small degree. The main 'advantaged' ethnic group are the native-born sabra Israelis. The main 'disadvantaged' demographic group are recent immigrants. Somewhat surprisingly, Ethiopians do not underperform compared with other immigrants, other things being equal.

T1  - Race and attitudes toward police: the mediating effect of social distance
AN  - 1752994925; 201601142
AB  - Purpose - Given the consistent finding in the literature that members of minority groups hold less favorable views of the police than white citizens, social distance may be an important, yet untested, mediator. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of social distance net of other established correlates. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of students attending a university in the northeastern USA completed an online survey in 2013. The survey was about their contact with the police, attitudes toward the police, and lifestyles, among others. Findings - Race, along with other predictors, significantly influenced confidence in police. However, race is the only factor that turns nonsignificant when social distance is included in the model. Mediation tests confirmed that social distance mediates the relationship between race and confidence in the police. Research limitations/implications - To maximize confidence in the police, administrators should focus on closing the social distance between the public and the police through initiatives like community policing. Originality/value - While there is extensive research on public attitudes toward the police, social distance has been neglected as a determinant, despite movements like community policing that promote citizens' relational closeness to the police - that is, to decrease the social distance between police and the public. The current study would be an exploratory study and reference for future studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Spatial and Demographic Determinants of Racial Threat
AN  - 1667949439; 201509675
AB  - Objective Although scholars have cast doubt on Key's ( ) racial threat hypothesis, race continues to play a central role in American politics. But does living in a racially diverse context lead to liberalization or a white backlash? We aim to test the validity of the racial threat hypothesis in the modern-day Deep South. Methods The data used for this analysis span multiple federal elections from the state of Louisiana, from 2000, 2004, and 2008, in addition to census data from 2000 and 2010. We utilize ArcGIS mapping software to construct a detailed depiction of voters' racial environments. Results We find that whites who live in racially diverse precincts exhibit lower rates of turnout than whites in homogenous precincts; however, segregation within the precinct mitigates the liberalizing effects of precinct-level diversity among whites. Conclusion The results of our analysis provide help to clarify the previously mixed empirical findings regarding the geographic distribution of minorities and white racial conservatism.

T1  - Undocumented Immigrant Threat and Support for Social Controls
AN  - 1728660349; 201534060
AB  - Popular support for enhanced border and internal controls to deal with undocumented immigration is examined in relation to contextual measures of group threat as well as perceived levels of cultural and economic threat posed by undocumented immigrants. Results from a national survey of non-Latino respondents (N = 1,364) indicate that presumed threatening context measured in static terms is inconsequential. But when context is measured in dynamic terms that also reflect dispersion and potential contact, it significantly predicts support for border controls. Perceived threats are stronger predictors of support for enhanced controls than either contextual indicators of presumed threat or individual characteristics of respondents. Results also show that perceived economic and cultural threats mediate the effects of individual respondent characteristics and dynamic contextual conditions as well. Implications for future research on immigrant threat emphasize the importance of context measured in both change and dispersion-related terms and responses to threat that distinguish alternative dimensions of control. Future work should also consider that perceptions of threat may not only have direct influence on immigration policy preferences but can mediate the effects of context and individual characteristics on those preferences.

AB  - It is possible to partially order cities according to the informativeness of neighborhoods about their ethnic groups. It is also possible to partially order cities with two ethnic groups according to the Lorenz criterion. We show that a segregation order satisfies four well-established segregation principles if and only if it is consistent with the informativeness criterion. We then use this result to show that for the two-group case, the Lorenz and the informativeness criteria are equivalent. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the value of employment for people living with spinal cord injury in Norway. The main focus in the 31 interviews dealt with general perceptions of integration and participation. The value of employment was a major theme, primarily described by the participants in terms of personal and social identity in interaction with others, as a hegemonic social norm and a sense of moral obligation to contribute to society. The value of meaningful regular jobs - in contrast to government projects jobs or routine jobs - was emphasized. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'We are in the same boat'. The dialogue between identification and dis-identification underlying individual and group positioning
AN  - 1748865103; 201600151
AB  - Kadianaki in this Special Issue offers an interesting conceptualization of the process whereby macro-societal drives organize the dynamic of inter-individual communication with a specific focus on power asymmetries among researcher and researched. The author bridges the notions of identity and power through the theory of social representations inviting scholars to consider the social and cultural context within which research encounters take place. Starting from the 'conceptual methodology' posited by Kadianaki, I suggest to go one step further towards a dialogical conceptualization of positionality discussing the key notion of positioning and the articulation between hegemonic, emancipated, and polemic social representations. In particular, the focus on the dynamic nature of consensus, underlying the production of social knowledge, entails to address a societal understanding of the complex dynamics of identification and dis-identification that feed the processes of self-construction and self-placing with both of them meant as a function of inter-group relations of power. Furthermore, some considerations are expanded with concern to the migration field of study. In particular, results from the study of Kadianaki stimulates reflections on the dynamics of resistance towards coercive self-categorization in search for a common identification that may reduce the power asymmetries among native and immigrant groups.

T1  - 'That's When the Neighborhood Went South': How Middle Class Blacks and Whites Police Racial Boundaries of Stigmatized Blackness
AN  - 1660021009; 201505570
AB  - Drawing on evidence from a case study of a racially transitioning suburb of Chicago, we argue that both blacks and whites discursively form, maintain, protect, and navigate contradictory class and racial identities. The interactions between race and class are complex, but how do these complexities manifest themselves? We contend that racial groups utilize discursive storytelling to maintain boundaries, and that this is one of the ways in which racial and class inequalities are created and preserved. Furthermore, we explore the interworking of race and class, focusing on how class location helps mediate self-proclaimed middle class blacks' and whites' discourse on stigmatized forms of blackness. We conclude with a discussion of the sociological implications of this boundary maintenance, focusing on the ways in which whites and blacks in the middle class utilize various forms of capital to preserve status and power.

T1  - Rejected, Shackled, and Alone: The Impact of Systemic Restricted Choice on Minority Consumers' Construction of Self
AN  - 1567049420; 201435077
AB  - This research investigates the experience of systemic restricted choice and its impact on self-concept among racial and ethnic minority consumers seeking financing. Choosing loans is an involved consumer choice journey, and encountering systemic, chronic, and uncontrollable restrictions on choice at any level of the goal/choice hierarchy limits and even prohibits minorities' ability to make desired choices. Across a multimethod investigation, these three studies demonstrate that minorities experiencing systemic restricted choice endure deleterious impacts to self-concept, including framing the self as fettered, alone, discriminated, and subservient, as well as marked reductions in self-esteem, self-autonomy, and self-efficacy. Minority consumers also frame themselves as striving in a world of limited resources and fighting uphill, often losing battles. Juxtaposing the experiences of racial/ethnic minorities against the choice journeys of educationally and economically similar white consumers puts those minority experiences in sharp relief. The theoretical and transformative consumer research implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Host Culture Acceptance, Religiosity, and the Threat of Muslim Immigration
AN  - 1703413198
AB  - This study explores the intricate relationships between a dominant group's fear of an immigrant group, religiosity, and the dominant culture's perception of if an immigrant group is motivated to culturally adapt. Specifically, Muslim immigration to Spain was analyzed. The study found the following: 1) threat from an immigrant group was negatively correlated with perception of immigrant motivation to adapt, 2) highly religious members of the dominant culture were less likely to believe Muslim immigrants are motivated to culturally adapt, and 3) increased contact with Muslim immigrants led to higher levels of realistic threat and symbolic threat among Spanish Catholics. Implications for integrated threat and intergroup communication research are discussed.

T1  - Religious Affiliation and Attitudes Towards Gay Men: On the Mediating Role of Masculinity Threat
AN  - 1559006880; 201431865
AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - To help or not to help an outgroup member: The role of the target's individual attributes in resolving potential helpers' motivational conflict
AN  - 1559006845; 201431880
AB  - When people are faced with the decision of whether or not to help an outgroup member, they often experience conflicting motivational tendencies due to the concurrent presence of factors prompting help and factors prompting non-help. We argue that one way of how people deal with this conflict is by taking a closer look at the target's individual attributes, especially at those indicating the target's benevolence. Findings of Experiment 1 (N = 96), in which we manipulated intercultural dissimilarity between participants and a (fictitious) recipient of help and normative pressure to help as two factors affecting motivational conflict, support this basic assumption. Specifically, response latencies analyses confirmed that participants assigned a culturally highly dissimilar target spent more time on inspecting target-related information when normative pressure, and thus motivational conflict, was high than when it was low. Experiment 2 (N = 141) extended these findings by demonstrating that providing potential helpers with explicit information about an outgroup member's benevolence increased helping intentions through reducing their negative interaction expectancies (and thus motivational conflict). As expected, this mediational relationship could only be observed for participants assigned a culturally highly dissimilar target. Experiment 3 (N = 46) replicated these mediation findings in a within-subjects design. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The Whitening Hypothesis Challenged: Biculturalism in Latino and Non-Hispanic White Intermarriage
AN  - 1559006342; 201432035
AB  - Assimilation theory holds that intermarriage between minorities and non-Hispanic whites is a gauge of integration and assumes that minorities jettison their ethnic identification in favor of whiteness. Drawing on race relations theory to argue that intermarriage is potentially transformative for non-Hispanic whites as well as Latinos, this article challenges assimilation theory's bias that minorities (should) undergo cultural change and that non-Hispanic whites remain unmoved. This article uses in-depth interviews with Latino and non-Hispanic white married couples to assess the consequences of ethnic intermarriage from the perspectives of both partners. Interethnic partners engaged in four 'ideal types' of biculturalism, running largely contrary to assimilation theory's social whitening hypothesis. Due to boundary blurring, exemplified by affiliative ethnic identity, non-Hispanic whites can migrate into Latino culture. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Consumer Racial Profiling in U.S. Restaurants: Exploring Subtle Forms of Service Discrimination against Black Diners
AN  - 1559005103; 201431931
AB  - In this article we advance scholarship on consumer racial profiling (CRP), in general, and the practice as it occurs in restaurant establishments, in particular, by presenting findings from a survey of restaurant consumers that was designed to ascertain the degree to which discriminate service is evident in black and white customers' perceptions and evaluations of their servers' behaviors. We found no evidence of interracial differences in subjects' perceptions of being the recipients of subtle server behaviors that are discretionally conveyed (e.g., recommend entree, compliment food choice, joke with, etc.) or those that constitute standard markers of service quality (e.g., eye contact, smiling, expressing appreciation, etc.). We did, however, find some evidence of CRP in customers' perceptions of their servers' attentiveness/promptness. Additionally, we found that African Americans tend to subjectively appraise their servers' performance less favorably than their white counterparts and this is the case even when other indicators of service discrimination are held constant. Findings taken as a whole suggest that servers' extend similar cues of hospitality but do so in qualitatively different ways (e.g., less sincere) across racial groups. We discuss the implications of these findings and conclude by encouraging additional scholarship on the subtle nature of racial discrimination in consumer settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Myth of the Ottoman Millet System: Its Treatment of Kurds and a Discussion of Territorial and Non-Territorial Autonomy
AN  - 1718067780; 201530781
AB  - This article re-opens the discussion about the Ottoman millet practice. The best known stereotypes claim that the so-called 'millet system' only offered rights to non-Muslim religious minorities. This article fundamentally challenges this approach. It focuses on how the millet practice was applied to the treatment of Kurds under the early and late Ottoman Empire, and discusses how millet practices were destroyed by the disease of nationalism. The article then considers how practices like those applied by the Ottomans might act as a useful example for modern nation states facing conflicts with national, religious, ethnic or migrant minorities. It suggests that practices like the millet might be beneficial both if minorities gain territorial recognition and also for those minorities who live in non-territorial communities.

T1  - Power, negotiations, and the anticipation of intergroup encounters
AN  - 1644755532
AB  - This review places intergroup encounters in a broad framework which considers the context in which such encounters take place, and in particular, the power dynamics at play. We address different forms of encounters, spanning from interpersonal interactions (not focused on intergroup aspects) to political negotiations between the groups' representatives, and argue for a deeper consideration of power asymmetries in examining such encounters. We argue that because high- and low-power group members have different motivations for change in the status quo, they differ in their expectations from intergroup encounters and in the types of encounters they prefer. We describe relevant research while considering moderating factors such as the legitimacy and stability of the power dynamics. We also identify remaining gaps and topics requiring further research. This work has both conceptual and practical implications for the prospects of promoting both positive attitudinal change as well as changes to the hierarchical status quo.

T1  - Inter-ethnic processes in post-Soviet space: theoretical background
AN  - 1512219146; 201408923
AB  - This introductory article of a special issue outlines the general theoretical background, formulates principles for a continuum of hot and cold ethnicities, gives a brief characterisation of the interethnic developments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and provides an overview of the papers. This collection of contributions deals with a variety of case studies with a particular focus on the strength of members' emotional attachment to their group. Such a division of ethnicities can be categorised into two prototypes: 'hot' and 'cold'. A 'hot' ethnic group is one whose members have a high emotional attachment to their group. 'Cold' ethnic groups are those whose members' emotional attachment to the groups is low, absent or latent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - On the Edges of Belonging: Indian American Dalits, Queers, Guest Workers and Questions of Ethnic Belonging
AN  - 1494300433; 201401971
AB  - Questions of assimilation and belonging remain as important themes in the immigration and ethnicity literature. Most research focuses on ethnic groups and their sense of belonging to the societies they live in, with less attention given to processes that affect belonging among ethnic subgroups. Using primary and secondary data, we examine cases of three Indian-origin groups -- Dalits, Queers and Guest Workers -- in the USA to discuss the structures that shape belonging of Indian Americans, particularly those in these subgroups. Drawing on the notion of dynamic multi-layered ethnicities, we discuss the intersections of race/class/caste/sexuality/gender that structure their belonging. We argue that focus on the entire ethnic group is insufficient for analysing the factors that shape belonging; instead, we posit that examining how the social location of the main ethnic group intersects with the structural positions of subgroups is crucial to discussions of the concept of belonging.

T1  - Can religious affiliation explain 'ethnic' inequalities in the labour market
AN  - 1438561076; 201340227
AB  - The disadvantage experienced in the labour market by the ethnic groups currently in Britain has long been established. This study builds on earlier research by exploring how far religious affiliation can explain these inequalities. Distinguishing the effects of ethnicity and religion is difficult for both conceptual and technical reasons, due to the 'identification' problem. We therefore estimate the effects by focusing on cases where ethnicity and religion cross-cut each other, excluding those groups where ethnicity and religion coincide. The results demonstrate a strong 'Muslim penalty' for both women and men from different ethnic groups with respect to economic activity and unemployment. Furthermore, the apparent 'ethnic' effects estimated for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in models that do not control for religion prove to be similar in magnitude to the effect of Muslim religion estimated in models from which Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have been excluded.

T1  - Do We Need Social Cohesion in the 21st Century? Multiple Languages of Belonging in the Metropolis
AN  - 1438555468; 201340287
AB  - Discussions about belonging, national identity and social cohesion are part of a broader debate that emerges from a number of concerns, mainly to do with identity and specifically with ethnic or religious identities versus the perceived homogeneous national identity. One major concern in immigration countries is that many immigrants and ethnic minorities are not integrating into the destination or receiving societies. This perceived lack of integration creates fears about whether newcomers are developing a shared sense of belonging to the national identity. Without this commitment it is feared that social cohesion and indeed the very basis of liberal democracy is under threat. In this paper, I question whether this fear is valid by exploring the relationship between the individual and society through the notion of 'sense of belonging' -- to a community, to a polity and to the nation. What does this mean in terms of national identity and social cohesion? In other words, do we have to have a shared sense of belonging to the nation to be responsible citizens? First, I will briefly explore some of the theoretical debates about belonging to the nation. Second, by analysing immigrant narratives on citizenship, belonging and community in London, I examine the multifaceted modes of belonging and whether migrants and ethnic minorities, who do not have a sense of belonging to the nation or who have a sense of belonging to more than one symbolic or material locality, can still have a sense of belonging and commitment to the common good which in turn contributes to societal cohesion.

T1  - Oscar Handlin and the Problem of Ethnic Pluralism and African American Civil Rights
AN  - 1364701923; 201323536
AB  - As the nation grappled with African American civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s, historian Oscar Handlin, like many scholars of his generation, set out to make sense of the role of race in American democracy and to determine the proper path of black liberation. Handlin, already a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of immigration, viewed both civil rights and the experiences of American blacks through a lens of ethnic pluralism. Like many historians and social scientists following the Second World War, Handlin rejected race as an analytical category, asserting in Race and Nationality in American Life (1957) "that there is no evidence of any inborn differences of temperament, personality, character, or intelligence among the races." Instead, he argued that ethnicity was "The only meaningful basis on which one can compare social and cultural traits." The notion that American society was composed of disparate ethnic groups with their own particular cultural affinities resonated with liberal social scientists and historians of the 1950s and 1960s for a number of reasons. Ethnic pluralism was, of course, consistent with models of interest group politics that had gained primacy following the New Deal. More to the point, in identifying culture as the nexus of group identity, ethnic pluralism constituted a formal rejection of eugenics and other biological metaphors of race. Handlin's identification of African Americans as an ethnic rather than racial group would ultimately lead him to draw fairly optimistic conclusions about the future of American race relations.

T1  - Hate-Crime Victimization and Fear of Hate Crime Among Racially Visible People in Canada: The Role of Income as a Mediating Factor
AN  - 1660021836; 201505578
AB  - Hate-crime victimization against racially visible people is of growing concern and it raises questions about social cohesion in a multiracial and ethnic democracy such as Canada, particularly among immigrants across the country. Using income as a mediating factor, this article examines hate-crime victimization against visible minority groups in Canada using the Ethnic Diversity Survey. Using multinomial and binary logistic regression, the study describes the likelihood of experiencing hate crime victimization and fear of hate crime. The results indicate that hate crime and fear of hate crime depends on visible minorities' ethnic background, above and beyond their socioeconomic status. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Bonding and Bridging Activities in the Context of a Common Spaces Approach to Integration
AN  - 1512218839; 201408790
AB  - This paper utilized the analytical file of the Ethnic Diversity Survey (EDS 2002) to examine the relationship between bridging and bonding activities for identified immigrant and non-immigrant groups and variables selected to measure integration through the creation of common spaces. Based on Ager and Strang's (2004; 2008) model, we hypothesized that both bonding and bridging activities increased the likelihood of outcomes that reflect and create the common spaces increasingly associated with integration. Bridging activities were associated with the creation of common spaces, used here as a marker of integration, in almost every instance, while bonding activities were associated with integration in some but not all instances. Our analysis supports a conceptual model of integration that highlights the development of common spaces radiating outward from self-identified ethnic groups as both a means and a marker for integration.

T1  - Manipulating national identity: the strategic use of rhetoric by supporters and opponents of the 'Cronulla riots' in Australia
AN  - 1567049409; 201435075
AB  - This research explores the role of opinion-based groups in understanding responses to racist violence such as the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia. Traditionally, explanations of collective action in social psychology and sociology focus on conflict between broad social categories. We propose that the responses to the riots can be understood not only as inter-group conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims, or an in-group argument amongst non-Muslims, but as a bona fide inter-group conflict between supporters and opponents of the riots. We argue that these groups use rhetoric in attempts to claim dominant status within society by aligning their identities with positively valued social categories such as ethnicities and national identities. The analysis of rhetoric from the groups supporting and opposing the riots demonstrates consistent, albeit contested, attempts to align support for the riot with the Australian national category in conflict with countervailing attempts to align opposition to the riot with the same national category.

First, prejudice reflects understandings of social identity -- the relationship of "us" to "them" -- that are shared within particular groups. Second, these understandings are actively promoted by leaders who represent and advance in-group identity. Third, prejudice is identified in out-groups, not in-groups.

T1  - Between Competing Imaginaries of Statehood: Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian (RAE) Leadership in Newly Independent Kosovo
AN  - 1347781276; 201318903
AB  - Socio-economic indicators and human-rights reports all suggest that the situation of Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian minorities (RAE) in Kosovo is extremely severe and only limited improvements have occurred since the end of the Kosovo conflict ten years ago. This article explores the governance of the 'other minorities' (i.e. non-Serbian) in contemporary Kosovo and in particular the issues of integration and return in the context of the process of state-building in Kosovo. Drawing on in-depth interviews with RAE leaders, the article shows how they are caught between multiple and conflicting agendas and power structures-namely the Kosovo government, the Serbian state and the international community-as well as being under pressure from the Kosovo RAE diaspora that fears forced return to Kosovo. Overall, it is argued that the situation of RAE minorities can provide a lens through which to observe the conflicting and competing models of state and nation championed by the Albanian leadership, the EU and a number of international agencies, as well as offering an alternative narrative on the ethnically pacified new Kosovo.

T1  - Social integration and identity of immigrants from western countries, the FSU and Ethiopia in Israel
AN  - 1567049276; 201435056
AB  - This study of immigrants' integration in Israel centers on one major subjective parameter, namely the immigrant's identity. To explain it we explore a series of possible factors: demographic variables, economic status, and human and social capital characteristics. Three recent immigrant groups are examined: from Western countries, from the former Soviet Union (FSU), and from Ethiopia. These immigrants came to Israel during the last two decades from different societies, following different immigration circumstances and various motives. The findings, based on the 2007 Ruppin survey data, point to the significant impact of the identity as perceived by veteran Israelis on the immigrants' self-identity for the three groups under study. Also, different variables affect each of the immigrant groups. FSU immigrants behaved according to most of our hypotheses, whereas Western and Ethiopian immigrants did not. Findings are discussed in light of the debate on measuring and defining immigrants' identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Agents of Change: Mixed-Race Households and the Dynamics of Neighborhood Segregation in the United States
AN  - 1364699796; 201323384
AB  - This article explores the effects of mixed-race household formation on trends in neighborhood-scale racial segregation. Census data show that these effects are nontrivial in relation to the magnitude of decadal changes in residential segregation. An agent-based model illustrates the potential long-run impacts of rising numbers of mixed-race households on measures of neighborhood-scale segregation. It reveals that high rates of mixed-race household formation will reduce residential segregation considerably. This occurs even when preferences for own-group neighbors are high enough to maintain racial separation in residential space in a Schelling-type model. We uncover a disturbing trend, however; levels of neighborhood-scale segregation of single-race households can remain persistently high even while a growing number of mixed-race households drives down the overall rate of residential segregation. Thus, the article's main conclusion is that parsing neighborhood segregation levels by household type-single versus mixed race-is essential to interpret correctly trends in the spatial separation of racial groups, especially when the fraction of households that are mixed race is dynamic. More broadly, the article illustrates the importance of household-scale processes for urban outcomes and joins debates in geography about interscalar relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Explaining racial disparities in access to employment benefits
AN  - 1037879176; 201231204
AB  - This research examines disparities in access to pension and health insurance plans between white, blacks, Latino and Asian workers in the American labour force. Using data from the 2006 March Supplement of the Current Population Survey, the analysis reveals that Latino workers are the most disadvantaged and white workers are the most advantaged. The entire gap in likelihood of receiving benefits between whites and Asians, and a substantial portion of the gap between whites and blacks, can be accounted for by socio-demographic and employment-related variables, but only a small portion of the gap between whites and Latinos can be attributed to such variables. The findings suggest that reliance on earnings for estimation of inequality underestimates the economic gap between racial groups. Explanations for disparities in access to employment benefits are offered and the relevance of the findings to other societies is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Encoding and Fake Equality in Popular Reality Shows: Lessons from Israel
AN  - 1023030516; 201223876
AB  - This paper critically examines the representation of two major minorities in Israel, Arab citizens of Israel and Jewish immigrants, by focusing on the widely popular genre of reality shows. We demonstrate that this genre contains sophisticated mechanisms of differentiation and selection that inevitably exclude and stigmatise minority participants. To demonstrate this thesis the paper takes a close look at two Israeli reality shows that were conceived to have a public value-Wanted: A Leader and The Ambassador. The examination of these shows reveals how Israeliness-presented as the space of equal opportunity-contains discriminatory mechanisms based on national and ethnic affiliations. Thus, the study illustrates that national identity could be utilised as a meta-narrative of universality and inclusiveness, but actually refers to a particular type of identity that is ethnically restricted.

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 1037878648; 201232917
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success must be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - Weak Performance-Strong Determination: School Achievement and Educational Choice among Children of Immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 919904471; 201201662
AB  - We ask how the advantages and disadvantages in the educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden are produced, making a theoretical distinction between mechanisms connected with school performance on one hand, and educational choice on the other. Using a new data set, covering six full cohorts of Swedish-born ninth-graders in 1998-2003 (N = 612,730), with matched school-Census information, we show that children of non-European immigrant origin are disadvantaged in their school performance but advantaged in their choice of academic upper secondary education. They have lower and more often incomplete grades, which force a sizeable proportion-10-20 per cent-into non-meritorious tracks or lead them to leave school. Given grades, children of non-European background make heterogeneous choices: many do not enrol in upper secondary education, but among those who do the propensity is high that they choose academic studies before vocational. In contrast, children of the 'old' (chiefly Nordic) labour immigrants are similar to the majority group in their equal preference for these two routes. A school system where choice plays a significant role appears to be advantageous for the often high-aspiring second-generation immigrant students, but greater efforts to reduce early achievement differences may still alleviate ethnic minority disadvantages.

T1  - HIV Risk Profiles Among HIV-Positive, Methamphetamine-Using Men Who Have Sex with Both Men and Women
AN  - 902084046; 201123588
AB  - This study examined demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, sexual beliefs, and substance use patterns in HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) (n=50) as compared to men who have sex with men only (MSM) (n=150). Separate logistic regressions were conducted to predict group membership. In the final model, of 12 variables, eight were independently associated with group membership. Factors independently associated with MSMW were acquiring HIV through injection drug use, being an injection drug user, using hallucinogens, using crack, being less likely to have sex at a bathhouse, being less likely to be the receptive partner when high on methamphetamine, having greater intentions to use condoms for oral sex, and having more negative attitudes about HIV disclosure. These results suggest that, among HIV-positive methamphetamine users, MSMW differ significantly from MSM in terms of their HIV risk behaviors. Studies of gay men and HIV often also include bisexual men, grouping them all together as MSM, which may obscure important differences between MSMW and MSM. It is important that future studies consider MSM and MSMW separately in order to expand our knowledge about differential HIV prevention needs for both groups. This study showed that there were important differences in primary and secondary prevention needs of MSM and MSMW. These findings have implications for both primary and secondary HIV prevention among these high-risk populations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality
AN  - 925714343; 201206801
AB  - Social dominance theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) contends that institutional-level mechanisms exist that reinforce and perpetuate existing group-based inequalities, but very few such mechanisms have been empirically demonstrated. We propose that gendered wording (i.e., masculine- and feminine-themed words, such as those associated with gender stereotypes) may be a heretofore unacknowledged, institutional-level mechanism of inequality maintenance. Employing both archival and experimental analyses, the present research demonstrates that gendered wording commonly employed in job recruitment materials can maintain gender inequality in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the existence of subtle but systematic wording differences within a randomly sampled set of job advertisements. Results indicated that job advertisements for male-dominated areas employed greater masculine wording (i.e., words associated with male stereotypes, such as leader, competitive, dominant) than advertisements within female-dominated areas. No difference in the presence of feminine wording (i.e., words associated with female stereotypes, such as support, understand, interpersonal) emerged across male- and female-dominated areas. Next, the consequences of highly masculine wording were tested across 3 experimental studies. When job advertisements were constructed to include more masculine than feminine wording, participants perceived more men within these occupations (Study 3), and importantly, women found these jobs less appealing (Studies 4 and 5). Results confirmed that perceptions of belongingness (but not perceived skills) mediated the effect of gendered wording on job appeal (Study 5). The function of gendered wording in maintaining traditional gender divisions, implications for gender parity, and theoretical models of inequality are discussed.

T1  - Occupational Match: Over- and Undereducation Among Immigrants in the Swedish Labor Market
AN  - 914766598; 201200144
AB  - The aim of this article is to study the differences in the match/mismatch of education and job level as well as the differences between the native and immigrant population in the occupational match. A distinction is made between educational levels and general and vocational education. A sample consisting of native Swedes and nine immigrant groups, based on register data, was selected for analysis. Descriptive statistics are presented and analyzed as well as logistic regression analysis controlling for basic human capital and immigrant specific variables. The main conclusions of the article are that there are considerable differences between vocational and general education in the match/mismatch, as well as differences between natives and immigrants. The vocationally educated population shows a higher match compared to the generally educated, but the generally educated population shows a higher proportion of undereducated individuals compared to the vocationally educated population. Although there are considerable differences between the studied immigrant groups, the general conclusion is that the immigrated population shows a lower match between educational level and skills level of the job as well as a higher level of overeducation compared to the native population.

T1  - Color by Numbers: Minority Earnings in Canada 1995-2005
AN  - 914766575; 201200191
AB  - We investigate the pattern of earnings disparity across Canadian-born ethnic groups in Canada over three census years, 1996, 2001, and 2006. This extends "Colour My World" by 10 years (Pendakur and Pendakur 2002). We find that the earnings gaps faced by Canadian-born visible minorities have not eroded since the 1990s. This is somewhat surprising given that the size of this population has radically increased over the last 20 years. Other patterns observed in the 1990s, such as the relatively poor earnings outcomes of South Asians and Blacks, particularly in Montreal and Toronto, are still evident into the 2000s. An exception to the "bad news" outlook is that persons of Caribbean origin have seen substantial convergence in their earnings relative to majority workers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contemporary indigeneity and the contours of its modernity
AN  - 964189734; 201207501
AB  - This article examines the idioms of 'modernity' with specific focus on indigenous peoples and their engagement with larger society in respect of culture, development and jurisprudence. This engagement in the past 50 years has largely been within the terms of the nation-state system, and related international fora. It is argued that these indigenous communities, in all their great diversity across the world, have nevertheless been largely successful in carving out adequate political spaces to stake their claims as distinct 'peoples' rather than simply being recognized as one among the several ethnic groups or minorities of a nation-state polity. This distinction is crucial and this paper shows why and how. This is not to say that the indigenous communities the world over have similar terms of engagement as their own heterogeneity defies any neat typological schema. At the same time, the multiple idioms of the current indigenous discourse, however, should not be treated as cacophonic but as embodying consciously crafted tools for boundary negotiations and voicing indigenous identities. This article reflects on this achievement by providing a survey of these developments even as it critically explores the terms of the discourses themselves.

T1  - Towards a Social Psychology of Citizenship? Introduction to the Special Issue
AN  - 919902928; 201201503
AB  - The concept of citizenship is currently the subject of extensive, and often heated, debate on the part of policy makers and social scientists. Many of the key concerns encapsulated in the idea of citizenship -- collective identity, solidarity, pro-social behaviour, group boundaries, intra and intergroup conflict -- also represent longstanding concerns on the part of social and community psychologists. However, at present, very little psychological theory or research directly addresses the subject of citizenship. The aim of this Special Issue is to explore how the construct of citizenship might contribute to social psychological understandings of social conflict and solidarity and, conversely, to consider how existing social psychological theories and methods might contribute to contemporary understandings of citizenship. The authors of the six articles in the Special Issue apply a range of theoretical perspectives (self-categorization theory, social identity theory, rhetorical psychology, the theory of social representations) and methods (experiments, surveys, interviews, ethnography) to examine situated understandings of citizenship in a variety of domains (civic and political participation, immigration attitudes, minority identities, nationalism). Despite their different approaches, the authors display a common concern to recognize complexity, contradiction and contestability as inherent, and often productive, features of the everyday construction and performance of citizenship. As a consequence, social psychological perspectives may have the potential to restore the damaged reputation of the citizen currently apparent in much policy and social scientific discourse.

T1  - Perpetually temporary: citizenship and ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia
AN  - 1010631894; 201210511
AB  - There is a clear trend in Western democratic countries towards regularizing the status of long-term ethnic minority residents through the conferral of full and equal citizenship rights. Ethnic minorities who arrived as irregular or temporary migrants in the West are increasingly allowed to follow the immigrant path towards integration into the broader citizenry. This is largely due to recognition that the price of exclusion is not only unjust, but it increases the risk of racial tensions, criminality, and social violence. Investigating the relevance of these Western developments to Cambodia, this article focuses on Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese minority. Despite residing in Cambodia for generations, ethnic Vietnamese have traditionally been regarded as 'foreign residents' and denied citizenship. Based on extensive field research, this article considers the history and reality of Cambodia's ethnic Vietnamese minority as well as the ethnically-exclusionary policies and practices of the state and Khmer majority towards them.

T1  - A Gulf Unites Us: The Vietnamese Americans of Black New Orleans East
AN  - 1417526558; 201332079
AB  - Asian Americans have historically been enlisted by dominant whites to delegitimize black claims for justice, particularly in the aftermath of racial crises. This process has been termed racial triangulation, and the Los Angeles unrest of 1992 serves as perhaps its most salient example in recent memory. But in the wake of Hurricane Katrina (2005), the Vietnamese American and black residents of New Orleans East demonstrated profound, if understated, acts of solidarity that challenged triangulation. This article highlights two factors that contributed black-Asian solidarity. First, both communities were buoyed by respective histories of resilienceusable pasts that community members summoned to explain their unlikely return and rebuilding efforts. Their stories became mutually recognizable, as each saw in the other motives for return that could not be reduced to economic concerns. Second, Vietnamese American and black residents of New Orleans East were not prone to the class antagonisms said to enflame the supposed 'black-Asian conflict' now endemic to the contemporary inner city. In New Orleans East, class heterogeneity cuts across both racial groups, and in a moment of racial crisis such complex and layered class dynamics can neutralize presupposed antagonisms, thus clearing path for unexpected alliances.

T1  - The Effect of Ethnic Diversity and Community Disadvantage on Social Cohesion: A Multi-Level Analysis of Social Capital and Interethnic Relations in UK Communities
AN  - 881465604; 201116410
AB  - A number of studies have found a negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social capital and assumed from this a harmful effect of diversity on social cohesion. This article suggests that social cohesion must be treated as a multifaceted concept and any analysis into the relationship between diversity and social capital needs to be complemented by an analysis of diversity's effect on 'relations between ethnic groups'. Our results show that while increasing diversity does have a negative impact on social capital, it simultaneously improves perceptions of, and relations between, ethnic groups. Furthermore, we find that forming 'bridging' ties in diverse environments plays a significant role in the positive relationship between diversity and tolerance, and that the presence of 'bridging' ties can also reduce the negative impact of diversity on social capital. However, while our results show that diversity has both positive and negative effects on social cohesion, we find that it is disadvantage which has the most detrimental impact, undermining both social capital and interethnic relations. We also find evidence that using a more sensitive measure of diversity (creating an area typology based on the proportional size, number, and type of ethnic groups in an area) reveals that living in different structures of diversity may lead to different social cohesion outcomes.

T1  - Sons of the Soil, Migrants, and Civil War
AN  - 856403733; 201106869
AB  - In nearly a third of ethnic civil wars since 1945, the conflict develops between members of a regional ethnic group that considers itself to be the indigenous asons of the soila and recent migrants from other parts of the country. The migrants are typically members of the dominant ethnic group who migrate in search of land or government jobs, often supported by the state with economic incentives and development schemes. This paper elaborates on the concept of a sons-of-the-soil conflict; presents descriptive statistics and empirical patterns; identifies a typical escalation sequence; illustrates the several steps with an account of the Tamil-Sinhalese conflict along with other cases; discusses the obstacles to negotiated settlements; and concludes with a suggestion on the role of grievances in explaining civil war onsets.

AB  - How does age influence public opinion regarding controversial social issues? The issues at stake are: attitudes toward Muslims, Jews, Affirmative Action, immigration, abortion, and gays and lesbians. While we understand the importance of including opinions toward African-Americans among these categories, we found little data on opinions toward this group by age. We also discuss opinions toward Darwin's theory of evolution and stem cell research since they were issues that pitted science against religion in American society and were important topics of intense political discussion. The selection of issues is based on the importance of these issues in public debate and electoral politics. A number of these issues, mainly those related to opinions toward religious and racial groups, reflect the development of American society and draw lines of possible disagreements and social cleavages.

AN  - 1221407497; 201244014
AB  - Intermarriage with natives is a key indicator of immigrant integration. This article studies intermarriage for 138 immigrant groups in Sweden, using longitudinal individual level data. It shows great variation in marriage patterns across immigrant populations, ranging from over 70 percent endogamy in some immigrants groups to below 5 percent in other groups. Although part of this variation is explained by human capital and the structure of the marriage market, cultural factors (values, religion, and language) play an important role as well. Immigrants from culturally more dissimilar countries are less likely to intermarry with natives, and instead more prone to endogamy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Issues in the Assessment of "Race" Among Latinos: Implications for Research and Policy
AN  - 1010630682; 201210459
AB  - Measurement of race and ethnicity is integral to assessing and addressing health disparities experienced by minorities. However, the unique experiences of Latinos related to race and the discordance between understandings of race among Latinos and the predominant U.S. conceptualizations of this construct impact how Latinos respond to measurement approaches. As a result, data collection methodologies often yield ambiguous responses that reveal little about this population. This article examines Latinos' racial responding, and how this relates to their experiences and understanding of their racial identity. We recommend the use of a combined race and ethnicity question and open-ended race and ethnicity questions, when feasible, which will likely yield more meaningful data that can be used to address this populations' health needs.

T1  - Essentialist theory of 'hybrids': From animal kinds to ethnic categories and race
AN  - 835111524; 201100426
AB  - This article presents a theory of the perception of hybrids, resulting from cross-breeding natural animals that pertain to different species and of children parented by couples with a mixed ethnic or racial background. The theory states that natural living beings, including humans, are perceived as possessing a deeply ingrained characteristic that is called 'essence' or 'blood' or 'genes' in everyday discourse and that uniquely determines their category membership. If, by whatever means, the genes or essences of two animals of different species are combined in a hybrid, the two incompatible essences collapse, leaving the hybrid in a state of non-identity and non-belonging. People despise this state and reject the hybrid (Study 1). This devaluation effect holds with cross-kind hybrids and with hybrids that arise from genetically combining animals from incompatible habitats across three cultures: Austria, India and Japan (Study 2). In the social world, groups and ethnic or racial categories frequently are essentialized in an analogue way. When people with an essentialist mindset judge ethnically or racially mixed offspring, they perceive a collapse of ethnic or racial essence and, consequently, denigrate these children, as compared to children from 'pure' in-group or out-group parents (Study 3). The findings are discussed in terms of the widespread 'yuck factor' against genetically modified animals, in terms of the cultural concepts of monstrosity and of racism and prejudice.

T1  - Immigration and the Legacies of the Past: The Impact of Slavery and the Holocaust on Contemporary Immigrants in the United States and Western Europe
AN  - 756015689
AB  - It is a basic truism that the past influences the present, but the key questions concern which past and how its impact occurs. In this paper we seek to understand how legacies of the past affect the pathways and experiences of contemporary immigrants. Our specific concern is with the present-day impact of two momentous historical ethno-racial traumas: the Holocaust in Western Europe, and slavery and ensuing legal segregation ("Jim Crow") in the United States. At first blush, their legacies seem unrelated to immigration today, and these pasts are rarely central to discussions about it. But in fact memories of and institutional responses to the sins of the Nazi genocide, on the one hand, and of slavery and legal racial segregation, on the other, have played a role in shaping public perceptions and policies that affect contemporary immigrants and their children.
