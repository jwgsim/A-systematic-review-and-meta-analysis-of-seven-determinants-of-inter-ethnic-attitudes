T1  - Racist views in contemporary European societies
AN  - 2670390286
AB  - This attitudinal study examines racism – conceptualized as a general belief in a hierarchical order of racial/ethnic groups – from a comparative cross-national perspective. The study develops theoretical arguments regarding individual and country-level explanations of racist views and tests them using ESS data. It demonstrates that racist views are not rare in Europe, yet their extent varies substantially across countries. In societies with lower levels of social cohesion, citizens are more likely to adopt racist views, as compared to societies with higher levels of social cohesion. Although a country’s economic inequality is not associated with the prevalence of racist views, inequality does seem to condition the impact of gender on such views. In more economically unequal countries, the gender gap in racist views – where men express higher levels of racist views – is greater than in more economically equal countries. No association between ethnic diversity and levels of racist views was found.

T1  - Does State Tightness-Looseness Predict Behavior and Attitudes Early in the COVID-19 Pandemic in the USA?
AN  - 2662429404
AB  - We investigated how tightness-looseness, reflecting strictness of social norms, of state of residence in the USA predicts behaviors and attitudes related to COVID-19. Because individual-level tightness may better capture current attitudes during the pandemic, whereas state-level archival measures reflect historical factors, we assessed the extent to which tightness-looseness at both levels predicted adherence to public health guidelines and biases toward outgroups related to COVID-19. In Spring 2020, 544 mTurk participants, primarily from the 13 tightest and 13 loosest states, completed survey questions about health behaviors in response to COVID-19, endorsement of future policy changes, feeling of responsibility for lives, and attitudes toward groups marginalized during the pandemic (i.e., Asians, older adults). State-level results indicated some associations with attitudes toward Asians and older adults, but effects were not robust. Results based on individuals’ ratings of the tightness of their state indicated that higher levels of perceived tightness were associated with higher levels of protective self-reported public health behaviors (e.g., mask wearing, handwashing) during COVID-19, more endorsement of future policy changes to contain the pandemic, higher reported feelings of responsibility for one’s life, and stronger negative attitudes toward Asians. The relations between tightness and health outcomes persisted after controlling for political attitudes and demographics. Thus, individual, more than state, tightness-looseness accounted for some degree of public health behaviors (unique contribution of individual tightness: R2 = .034) and attitudes toward marginalized groups (R2 = .020) early during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implications of these findings for interventions to support behavior change or combat anti-Asian bias are discussed.

T1  - The Role of Contact Richness in Mediated Intergroup Contact: A Test of the Contact Space Framework
AN  - 2662236750
AB  - Intergroup contact varies in richness of the experience, yet the effect of contact richness has not been systematically examined. This paper experimentally tested whether and how different levels of mediated contact richness—afforded by different forms of media—affect attitudes toward marginalized outgroups (e.g., refugees, migrant workers). Data collected online from an adult sample (N = 510) found that richness of the mediated contact experience increased feelings of psychological closeness of the depicted outgroup member, which then reduced intergroup anxiety and perceived threat of the outgroup. This, in turn, increased support for policies that promote more humane and equitable conditions for the two outgroups. Theoretical implications for intergroup contact theory and practical implications for utilizing media programs to reduce intergroup bias are discussed.

T1  - “They created a team of almost entirely the people who work and are like them”: A qualitative study of organisational culture and racialised inequalities among healthcare staff
AN  - 2630549552
AB  - Racially and ethnically minoritised healthcare staff groups disproportionately experience and witness workplace discrimination from patients, colleagues and managers. This is visible in their under‐representation at senior levels and over‐representation in disciplinary proceedings and is associated with adversities such as greater depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, low job satisfaction and sickness absence. In the UK, little progress has been made despite the implementation of measures to tackle racialised inequities in the health services. So, what is it about the health service organisational context which shapes and maintains such inequities, and what role does discrimination, bullying and harassment play? Drawing on qualitative interviews with 48 healthcare staff in London (UK), we identify how micro‐level bullying, prejudice, discrimination and harassment behaviours, independently and in combination, exploit and maintain meso‐level racialised hierarchies. Within teams, the high diversity–low inclusion dynamic shaped and was perpetuated by in‐ and outgroup inclusion and exclusion processes (including “insidious dismissal”) often employing bullying or microaggressions. These were linked to intersecting factors, such as race, ethnicity, migration, language and religion, and could increase segregation. For racially and ethnically minoritised groups, ingroup maintenance, moving teams or leaving were also ways of coping with organisational inequities. We discuss implications for tackling racialised workplace inequities.

T1  - Common Ingroup Identity, Perceived Similarity, and Communal Interracial Relationships
AN  - 2524147916
AB  - Integrating theory on interpersonal relationships and intergroup relations, this research examined the role of common ingroup recategorization (i.e., perceiving outgroup members as belonging to the same superordinate group as oneself) in fostering communal interracial relationships. A cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a short-term intensive longitudinal study (Study 2) involving Black and White friendship and romantic dyads suggested that recategorization predicted greater communal motivation and security via perceived similarity. These effects were found in terms of both enduring characteristics and changes over time. In turn, communal motivation and security predicted greater self-reported prosocial behavior and relationship satisfaction, suggesting that they are beneficial to interracial relationship quality. Communal motivation also predicted increases over time in recategorization and perceived similarity, suggesting bidirectional effects. Taken together, these results suggest a reciprocal process in which common ingroup recategorization and perceptions of similarity promote and derive from the communal nature of interracial relationships.

T1  - “You wouldn’t celebrate September 11”: Testing online polarisation between opposing ideological camps on YouTube: GPIR
AN  - 2447807627
AB  - Online communication is increasingly associated with growing polarisation in society. In this research, we test a dual-pathway model of online polarisation via intergroup and intragroup interaction of supporters of opposing ideological camps on YouTube. The interaction occurs over a video parody promoting a campaign to change the date of Australia Day celebrations, a divisive issue entailing contrasting narratives about Australian identity, meanings of Australia Day, and interpretations of colonial history. To capture ideological polarisation, we conducted computerised linguistic analysis of polarised talk in the form of comments and replies (N = 1,027) from supporters and opponents of the campaign. The indicators used to capture polarisation are social identification, position certainty, and psychological distance (as reflected by increased anxiety and hostility). Our results show that most polarisation (in the form of increased hostility) occurs in conditions of expression of outgroup dissent (the intergroup interaction pathway) and the most debated content on the online forum revolves around themes relevant to group identity. In addition to contributing to the understanding of group process in an online context, another key contribution of this research is providing a theory-driven method and blueprint to detect polarisation in social media data.

T1  - Facebook contact: The effect of an outgroup member’s language proficiency on desire for future intergroup contact
AN  - 2476844830
AB  - Guided by contact theory, we examined the effect of an international student’s English language proficiency on American students’ desire for future interaction with international students, online and in-person. We created a fictitious Facebook page of a female Chinese international student and experimentally manipulated her Facebook posts to represent low or high English proficiency. American students (N = 126) in the high proficiency condition reported more identification with the international student, which subsequently led to more desire for future interaction with the student both online and in person. These effects generalized to a desire for interaction with other Chinese students (again, both online and in person). The findings of the study have theoretical and practical implications for online intergroup communication.

T1  - Social Desirability Bias among Prejudice Instruments: An Integrated Threat
AN  - 2334197657
AB  - A considerable amount of research has examined the extent to which members of dominant cultures perceive minority groups as threatening their way of life. While various instruments measure these perceptions of threat, few researchers have empirically analysed the statistical properties of these scales. Specifically, studies have not adequately explored social desirability of threat scales. The current study investigates the extent to which one set of threat scales is internally consistent or reliable (González et al., 2008), and explores social desirability within the González et al. (2008) integrated threat instruments by comparing self-reports to other reports (intimate other and friend reports). Results indicate the instruments are internally consistent and that self-reports and other reports of threat do not differ on most indices of threat.

AN  - 2272702565
AB  - This article quantitatively investigates racial "othering" in Thailand by using available World Values Survey proxies. We review racial "othering" in Thailand through inter-group threat theory. We investigate the proportion of Thais who are racially and/or ethnically prejudiced, the number of Thais who are racially and/or ethnically prejudiced compared with other countries' citizens, whether Thais have become more racially and/or ethnically prejudiced from 2007 to 2013, the extent to which Thais are religiously discriminatory compared with other countries' citizens, and whether Thais became more religiously discriminatory from 2007 to 2013. We find relatively high levels of racial prejudice by Thais.

T1  - Understanding Appalachian Microaggression from the Perspective of Community College Students in Southern West Virginia
AN  - 2339037811
AB  - The term "Appalachian" is wrongly understood to represent a single culture of rural White poverty (Keefe, 2005). This conception contains stereotypical images that obscure hardships many rural White Central Appalachians face. Similar to other oppressed minorities in the U.S., what it means to be Appalachian is a social construction based on what differs them from the White hegemony. Recent scholarship on discrimination recognizes the importance of microaggression, small insults and slights experienced frequently by people from minority groups (Sue, et. al., 2007). Microaggression may be an especially insidious mechanism in the oppression of Appalachian people, since the derogatory stereotypes are broadly accepted while their oppressed status tends to not be acknowledged. This study applied qualitative focus group methodology to understand perceptions of microaggression and oppression among a sample of college students living in rural Central Appalachia. Results reveal themes of microaggression. Identifying Appalachian microaggression provides evidence of marginalized status and offers a framework for understanding how the social construction of White Appalachian perpetuates reduced status, stereotypes, and prejudice. Implications are discussed to consider how to foster resilience to oppression among rural White Central Appalachian people.

T1  - Whose Side Are You On? Asian Americans’ Mistrust of Asian–White Biracials Predicts More Exclusion From the Ingroup
AN  - 2220161498
AB  - We investigated Asian Americans’ perceptions of Asian–White biracials. Because the Asian/White boundary may be more permeable than other minority/White boundaries, we reasoned that Asian Americans are more likely than Black Americans to be skeptical of biracials, perceiving that biracials would prefer to identify as White and would be disloyal to Asians, consequently categorizing them as more outgroup. We further reasoned that Asian Americans’ concerns about and exclusion of biracials would be predicted by greater perceived discrimination against Asian Americans, which increases the incentive for biracials to pass into the higher status racial group. Studies 1 and 2 provided correlational support for these theorized relationships among Asian Americans. Study 2 showed that perceived discrimination did not increase Black Americans’ concerns about biracials’ identity preferences and loyalty. Studies 3 and 4 provided causal evidence for the roles of perceived discrimination and biracial identity preferences, respectively, in Asian Americans’ exclusion of biracials.

T1  - Public health as an agent of internal colonialism in interwar Czechoslovakia: shaping the discourse about the nation's children
AN  - 2081349434
AB  - Shmidt's text discusses the specifics of internal colonialism in the discourses and practices of the dominant group (Czechs) concerning Slovaks and Rusyns, ethnic groups from the peripheral, eastern areas of interwar Czechoslovakia. By targeting the reproductive patterns of these groups, seen as undesirable by the authorities, internal colonialism shaped the discourse about children by consistently opposing the normalized childhood inside the nation to the supposedly abnormal child development outside the civilizing process. Shmidt focuses on three interwar projects aimed at introducing new public health practices as an 'infrastructure of dependence' with regard to the peripheral groups. Being directly supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, these projects contributed to building the new Czechoslovak nation and securing its international legitimacy.

T1  - Ethnic solidarity and the vote: Mapuche candidates and voters in Chile
AN  - 2071272714
AB  - In this article, we evaluate ethnic solidarity and the vote in Chile with reference to the Mapuche, the largest and most traditional ethnic group in the country. We use electoral data from the mayoral elections of 2012, drawn from all the municipalities of the Araucanía, the region with the largest percentage of Mapuche population. Using a multi-level linear regression model and controlling for poverty and rurality, we found that Mapuche candidates, regardless of their political orientation, were indeed more successful than non-Mapuche candidates in areas with the greatest concentration of Mapuche voters. Additionally, we used results from an unpublished opinion survey conducted in three municipalities of the Araucanía. We concluded that after controlling for other variables ethnic solidarity prevails as a robust predictor of electoral behaviour, albeit more strongly in rural areas than urban ones. The Chilean case, moreover, is useful for studying the strategies used by the traditional parties that promote this solidarity - that is, by presenting candidates with Mapuche surnames in their lists.

T1  - The role of retributive justice and the use of international criminal tribunals in post‐conflict reconciliation
AN  - 2011520592
AB  - Four experiments examined people's responses to intergroup violence either committed or suffered by their own group. Experiment 1 demonstrated that Serbs who strongly glorified Serbia were more supportive of future violence against, and less willing to reconcile with, Bosniaks after reading about Serbian victimization by Bosniaks rather than Serbian transgressions against Bosniaks. Replicating these effects with Americans in the context of American–Iranian tensions, Experiment 2 further showed that demands for retributive justice explained why high glorifiers showed asymmetrical reactions to ingroup victimization vs. perpetration. Again in the Serb and the American context, respectively, Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that post‐conflict international criminal tribunals can help satisfy victim group members' desire for retributive justice, and thereby reduce their support for future violence and increase their willingness to reconcile with the perpetrator group. The role of retributive justice and the use of international criminal justice in intergroup conflict (reduction) are discussed.

T1  - “I have struggled really hard to learn Sami”: Claiming and regaining a minority language
AN  - 1947604998
AB  - This article sheds light on the issue of new speakerness via a case study focusing on one adolescent - “Elle” - and her efforts to claim and regain Sami, a national minority language in Sweden. Elle did not acquire Sami at home, but attended Sami school from first grade to sixth grade, where she learned to understand, read, and write the language. Ever since childhood, Elle has “struggled” to learn more Sami and to be acknowledged as a Sami speaker. It was only recently that Elle started using Sami actively in speech, reclaiming her Sami voice and breaking a silence to which she had been involuntarily submitted. A condition that for Elle could have resulted in language loss was, thus, by her efforts to regain the language, turned into a condition of language revitalization. This article shows how Elle’s narratives are linked to language ideologies and language policies in Swedish society, to negative attitudes towards Sami culture, and to discrimination. By learning and actively using Sami in writing and in speech, Elle exercises agency, and by taking the important step to start speaking, Elle proclaims her right to speak Sami and to her representation. The agency that Elle exercises by using Sami is beneficial for her own language development, but could also potentially contribute to the language revitalization of Sami and to the linguistic empowerment of other speakers/learners of Sami.

T1  - The importance of social-cognitive development and the developmental context for group dynamics: GPIR
AN  - 1932700126
AB  - A developmental approach provides a unique vantage point for understanding the origins, acquisition, and nature of change regarding intergroup attitudes and behavior. Developmental research has focused predominantly on understanding and addressing negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors. We assert that group identity and group dynamics do not have to lead to discriminatory and prejudicial behavior but can actually contribute to an inclusive orientation. Moreover, these orientations do not occur in a vacuum but depend on the broader social context and the specific group distinctions. A broader social and cultural approach is important for understanding the implications of intergroup attitudes for healthy social development as well as the creation of a fair and just society.

T1  - Chinese Indonesians: how many, who and where?
AN  - 1883576096
AB  - This paper provides new statistics to the debate on percentage of Chinese Indonesians, using the latest 100% data set of the 2010 population census. It reveals that the statistics is closer to the low side of the debate, less than 2.0%, rather than the high side of 3.0% and more. Ethnicity is here self-defined by the respondents. With 1.2%, the Chinese Indonesians ranked as the 15th largest group of more than 600 ethnic groups. This paper also produces statistics at the district level, the first ever statistics on Chinese Indonesians. It finds that some provinces and districts have large percentages of Chinese Indonesians, but the respective total population are relatively small to the total Indonesia's population. Majority of provinces and districts (25 out of 33 provinces and 415 out of 497 districts) have lower percentage of Chinese than the national figure.

T1  - Boundaries of belief: religious practices and the construction of ethnic identity in Hui Muslim communities
AN  - 1877540832
AB  - Though scholars of ethnicity remark that religion is an important qualifying attribute for membership in an ethnic group, the nature of the relationship between religious faith and ethnic identity requires further exploration. An approach that emphasizes the importance of religious practices in forming and maintaining ethnic boundaries may offer a more complete explanation of the relationship between religion and ethnicity. This article proposes a framework for understanding how religious practices influence ethnic boundary formation and maintenance processes. I propose that religious practices may play a universalizing, negotiating, or differentiating role in influencing the formation and maintenance of ethnic boundaries. To illustrate these various roles played by religious processes, the article presents a heuristic case study of Islamic faith in boundary setting processes in Hui Muslim communities in China.

T1  - The Interaction of Same-Sex Marriage Access With Sexual Minority Identity on Mental Health and Subjective Wellbeing
AN  - 1875136739
AB  - Previous psychological and public health research has highlighted the impact of legal recognition of same-sex relationships on individual identity and mental health. Using a sample of U.S. sexual minority (N = 313) and heterosexual (N = 214) adults, participants completed a battery of mental health inventories prior to the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) examining identity revealed sexual minority participants living in states where same-sex marriage was banned experienced significantly higher levels of internalized homonegativity than sexual minority participants living in states where same-sex marriage was legal, even after controlling for state-level political climate. Mental health ANCOVAs revealed sexual minority participants residing in states without same-sex marriage experienced greater anxiety and lower subjective wellbeing compared to sexual minority participants residing in states with same-sex marriage and heterosexual participants residing in states with or without same-sex marriage. Implications for public policy and future research directions are discussed.

T1  - Perpetual ingroup victimhood as a distorted lens: Effects on attribution and categorization
AN  - 1906667339
AB  - Although the effects of group-based victimhood on attitudes and emotions have been demonstrated in previous research, the ways it affects cognitive processes remain unclear. Four studies examined how a perpetual ingroup victimhood orientation (PIVO) affects cognitive biases. High levels of PIVO were associated with the categorization of more outgroups as hostile to the ingroup, and more rapid responses when using an enmity criterion (Study 1). PIVO was also associated with more attributions of malevolent intentions and fewer attributions of neutral intentions to outgroup members in ambiguous situations (Study 2a); when primed with reminders of historical group trauma, attribution of malevolent intentions increased among high- but not low- PIVO individuals (Study 2b). However, the effect extended to all participants when using a larger sample (Study 2c). The implications of these categorization and attributional biases are discussed in particular as regards the self-perpetuating nature of perceived group victimhood.

T1  - Introduction
AN  - 1855722260
AB  - The goal of this special issue is to explore the range of religious cultures among diverse ethnic groups of Southwest China, particularly the factors that have helped shape their development. In researching this topic, the papers below have focused on a number of key questions, including: (1) The interplay between state and society, including the roles of local elites; (2) The ways in which organized religions such as Buddhism, Daoism, and Christianity have interacted with indigenous ritual traditions; (3) The importance of gender and gender roles; (4) Spatial commonalities and differences throughout the region. Despite the great diversity of beliefs and practices examined below, all authors have treated religion as a key arena for mutual borrowing and accommodation that has enabled indigenous people to maintain elements of their ritual traditions despite the presence of external hegemonic cultures.

T1  - Who We Are Is What We Believe? Religion and Collective Identity in Austrian and German Immigrant Integration Policies
AN  - 1908432871
AB  - Immigrant integration is a contested policy field in which boundaries of membership are drawn and re-negotiated whereby groups of immigrants are partially included and excluded. Building on the concept of collective identity and theories of boundary making, this paper illustrates how religion functions as a category to mark and fill notions of self and otherness. As several studies have shown, immigrants in Europe are increasingly addressed as Muslims, a development that also serves the promotion of a Christian 'us'. Focusing on Austria and Germany, two countries where this is especially observable, the paper outlines the functioning of religion as symbolic boundary. The empirical study on national integration policies demonstrates how-within the relational process of boundary drawing against Muslims-a Christian identity narrative is established, how it functions as a marker of unity and how it relates to liberal and secular notions. Results from the qualitative content analysis of governmental policy programs from 2005 onwards show different patterns of boundary drawing on religion and the way they shape and limit the possibilities of inclusion. To understand this development, we have to look at Christian-democratic policy-makers, who currently dominate the political struggle for the power to define features of collective identity in immigrant integration policies.

T1  - Race, prejudice and attitudes toward redistribution: A comparative experimental approach
AN  - 1910696930
AB  - Past work suggests that support for welfare in the United States is heavily influenced by citizens' racial attitudes. Indeed, the idea that many Americans think of welfare recipients as poor Blacks (and especially as poor Black women) has been a common explanation for Americans' lukewarm support for redistribution. This article draws on a new online survey experiment conducted with national samples in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, designed to extend research on how racialised portrayals of policy beneficiaries affect attitudes toward redistribution. A series of innovative survey vignettes has been designed that experimentally manipulate the ethno-racial background of beneficiaries for various redistributive programmes. The findings provide, for the first time, cross-national, cross-domain and cross-ethno-racial extensions of the American literature on the impact of racial cues on support for redistributive policy. The results also demonstrate that race clearly matters for policy support, although its impact varies by context and by the racial group under consideration.

T1  - Feeling European: an exploration of ethnic disparities among immigrants
AN  - 1820665657
AB  - Over the last 20 years, European identity has become a key topic widely investigated in social sciences. However, most research has only focused on EU nationals and EU immigrants, neglecting the fact that a substantial segment of citizens in Europe are non-EU immigrants. This article explores the differences between and within EU and non-EU immigrant groups in terms of European identity and potential factors behind these differences. Based on the 2013 IAB-SOEP Migration Sample of first generation immigrants in Germany (N = 2581), this paper reveals that non-EU immigrants tend to identify as European - even if to a lesser extent than EU immigrants. Moreover it provides a systematic comparative exploration of different factors possibly able to foster a European identity among EU and non-EU immigrants. It reveals, for instance, that religious affiliation has no significant impact but that spatial mobility is especially important in accounting for patterns in ethnic disparities in the endorsement of a European identity. Furthermore, this article illuminates a positive association between European identity and identity with the receiving society among both EU and non-EU immigrants as well as a positive association between European identity and identification with the origin country among EU immigrants.

T1  - Barter Fairs, Ethnic Configuration and National Multiculturalism in the Argentinean Andes
AN  - 1808775966
AB  - In the Argentinean Andes, fairs constitute the main setting where lowland and highland Kolla peasants barter their agricultural production. In order to preserve these encounters - seen as traditional - in a context of peasants' growing participation in capitalist economy, public organizations invest money for boosting old fairs and instituting new ones. The author proposes to qualify these fairs as 'institutional', compared with the 'spontaneous' ones that come along with religious celebrations. Alluding to Bourdieu's concept of institutional rituals, this expression enlightens how such meetings assert social categories, whose boundaries are otherwise blurred. Drawing on an analysis of institutional fairs' social and symbolic performativity, the paper argues that rather than 'safeguarding ancestral customs', as claimed by the organizers, these specific festivals publically state the conditions for the ethnic group at play to be integrated within the nation state.

T1  - When are Stereotypes about Black Candidates Applied? An Experimental Test
AN  - 1951415540
AB  - Past research shows that candidates' racial identities influence the assumptions that voters draw about how they will behave in office. In a national survey experiment examining televised candidate advertisements, we find evidence that stereotypes differ both in their potency and how vulnerable they are to disconfirmation. Consistent with previous work, black candidates are broadly assumed to be more liberal than white candidates, although the effect is notably small in magnitude. Yet when it comes to more specific stereotypes--how black candidates will behave on individual issues--effects are not only much larger, but also more contingent on what information is available. We find that by providing a small bit of ideological information, black candidates can overcome the assumption that they will enact liberal policies as concerns taxation and non-racialized aspects of social welfare policy. But it is much more difficult for them to overturn the assumption that they will prioritize aid to minorities while in office.

T1  - The Alexandria YWCA, Race, and Urban (and Ethnic) Revival: The Scottish Christmas Walk, 1960s-1970s
AN  - 1802479940
AB  - On Dec 6, 1971, the front page of the Alexandria Gazette ran the headline: "Titans Snatch AAA Crown, Rout Lewis." The photographs and stories that followed celebrated the Titans' first state championship and the players who made it happen students from the newly integrated T. C. Williams High School. In one article, local newspaper reporter Mary Warren emphasized the team's success as a symbol of Alexandria's new "togetherness"--the school system's racial integration and the unification of local residents, both black and white, around the winning football team. For those interviewed, an integrated Alexandria was the City's present and future. Here, Moon discusses Alexandria YWCA, race, urban ethnic revival and the Scottish Christmas Walk in 1960s-70s.

T1  - Perceived moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination
AN  - 1796451720
AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

T1  - Room at the top? Minority mobility and the transition to demographic diversity in the USA
AN  - 1765125285
AB  - We examine the ramifications of the demographic transition to diversity in the USA through an analysis of changes at the top of the occupational hierarchy, as glimpsed in recent census data. We find evidence that, among the incumbents of better-paid occupations, the percentage of non-Hispanic whites, the historically dominant majority, is sharply declining, while the proportion of immigrant-origin minorities, Asians, both foreign and US born, and US-born Hispanics, is growing. African Americans, or US-born blacks, are not so far sharing much in this growth. However, whites still retain important advantages in terms of occupational placement net of education and in terms of earnings net of occupational placement. We conclude overall that demographic shifts are highly likely to drive further diversification at the top of the US workforce; the question of whether whites can hold on to their advantages in the face of these changes cannot be answered yet.

T1  - Panethnicity revisited: contested group boundaries in the post-9/11 era
AN  - 1789874862
AB  - Existing theories of panethnicity in the USA concentrate on Asian Americans and Latinos, two umbrella groups that originally coalesced during the 1960s civil rights era. Although the role played by the state is recognized as central to panethnic development, we argue that the influence of this pivotal variable is contingent on historical context. Through a case study of emerging minority groups (Middle Eastern and South Asian Americans in the post-9/11 era), we re-examine the existing conceptualization of panethnicity at a time when the state plays a more punitive than compensatory role. Using a methodology that draws on a range of novel sources, we document the way that pre-existing ethnic, religious and national-origin labels have been reinforced instead of panethnic labels for the populations under study. Accordingly, we develop an updated conceptualization of group formation that incorporates historical context and the role of the state in the post-9/11 era.

T1  - Ethnic belonging of the children born out of rape in postconflict Bosnia-Herzegovina and Rwanda
AN  - 1787949562
AB  - Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war in ethnic conflicts, and forced impregnations have been central to this strategy. Scholars however disagree on whether the cultural assimilation to the maternal group influences these children's identities, or whether they are perceived as belonging to the enemy group (Carpenter; Nikolic-Ristanovic). Drawing on preliminary qualitative findings collected in 2013 in Rwanda and Bosnia-Herzegovina, this paper analyses the ethnic identification imposed by the enemy group, the mothers and their community on the children born out of rape. It first explores how the mothers' ethnic identities are often subordinated to their fathers' ethnic background, and how this then justifies their social exclusion from their maternal ethnic group. This paper suggests that sexual violence is extremely effective in ensuring the continuation of the ethnic conflict in the aftermath of the violence by attacking the children's senses of belonging.

T1  - Who supports secession? The determinants of secessionist attitudes among Turkey's Kurds
AN  - 1787949441
AB  - Who supports secession in a multiethnic country? What factors lead to secessionist or separatist attitudes? Despite the substantial interest in secessionist movements, the micro-level factors and dynamics behind mass support for secession have been understudied. Using original and comprehensive data derived from two public opinion surveys, conducted in 2011 and 2013 with nationwide, representative samples, this study investigates the determinants of separatist attitudes among Turkey's Kurds. The empirical results show that perceptions of discrimination, ideological factors (i.e. a left-right division and partisanship), region and religious sect do affect support for secession. Our findings provide strong support for the grievance theory and, further, show that ideology is an important factor. However, the results call into question arguments drawing attention to the role of modernisation (i.e. socio-economic status) and of religiosity. The study also discusses some practical implications of the empirical findings.

T1  - Social Position and Place-Protective Action in a New ImmigrationContext: Understanding Anti-Mosque Campaigns in Catalonia<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558431452
AB  - This article examines the structural conditions and cultural narrativesunderlying the high frequency and intensity of anti-mosque campaigns in theSpanish region of Catalonia. Drawing on Blumer's theory of prejudice as a senseof group position, as it has been elaborated and extended to multi-ethnicsettings by subsequent scholarship, I contend that local reactions to mosques inCatalonia have been shaped by context-specific configurations of identity andurban space. I show how longstanding socio-economic and cultural divisionswithin Catalonia's native population, as well as the inscription of thesedivisions within the spatial ordering of the region, have heightened feelings ofthreat elicited by the large-scale arrival of Muslim immigrants to working-classneighborhoods in recent years. In advancing this argument, I build on theinsights of geographers and urban sociologists to develop a spatially sensitiveunderstanding of social position and perceived group threat that considers theimportance of place identities and the interaction between distinct registers ofterritorial belonging.

T1  - The cultural other and the nearest neighbor: Han-Nuosu relations in Zhaojue County, Southwest China
AN  - 1784139107
AB  - Greater Liangshan is one of the few regions of China where, among 70-80% of Nuosu, the Han are a minority. Instead of the much more common phenomenon of 'Hanification,' here we can observe Han absorbing traits of other ethnic groups. Based on two seasons of fieldwork combined with historical texts and previous ethnographic research, this paper discusses this phenomenon, raising issues of ethnic identity and the influence of local circumstances on interethnic relations. Throughout the paper, it becomes clear that there is no simple dichotomy between Han and Nuosu, but that the situation is considerably more complex. The Nuosu fall into several castes, and the Han settlers had two different experiences. Some were captured as slaves and tried to become fully Nuosu. Ethnic relations in the Greater Liangshan are thus highly complex and require more research to be thoroughly understood.

T1  - Still a Nation of Immigrants? Effects of Constructions of National History on Attitudes toward Immigrants
AN  - 1750356050
AB  - In the United States, the phrase "nation of immigrants" is used to both promote and restrict immigration. Those who use the phrase to promote immigration point to the similarities between current and previous generations of immigrants, whereas those who use it to restrict immigration emphasize the differences between the two generations. The present study examined the effects of the different versions of this historical narrative (similarity-focused vs. difference-focused) on 210 U.S. residents' attitudes toward immigrants during the recent debate about immigration reform. Exposure to the similarity-focused nation of immigrants reduced perceptions of threat from Mexican immigrants but did not affect the already low level of perceived threat from Russian immigrants. The similarity-focused version of nation of immigrants exerted an indirect effect on perceived threat from both groups by inducing a sense of identity continuity, which reduced collective angst about the future of the people of the United States. The findings suggest that pro-immigration policy makers clearly articulate the meaning of nation of immigrants rather than use it as a cliché as the phrase has the potential to induce inclusive attitudes.

T1  - Immigrants' Sense of Belonging to the Host Country: The Role of Life Satisfaction, Language Proficiency, and Religious Motives
AN  - 1728124275
AB  - This paper focuses on a significant concept in migration studies: immigrants' sense of belonging to the host society. Drawing upon the literature of immigration and subjective well-being, we proposed a model in which life satisfaction is a major predictor of immigrants' sense of belonging, and is explained by background variables including religious affiliation, religious motivation, native language proficiency and ethnic segregation. The study was based on a survey of two groups of highly skilled migrants in Israel; immigrants from France and the Former Soviet Union who moved to Israel in the last two decades. The findings suggest that, as expected, life satisfaction had a significant influence on immigrants' sense of belonging and served as a mediator variable in the model. Whereas ethnic segregation was not found to be a significant parameter in the model, religious motivation and Hebrew language proficiency were found to be prominent. In light of the literature, we also discuss the importance of religious motivations to immigrants' subjective well-being, identity, and sense of belonging.

T1  - Achieving Social Change: A Matter of All for One?
AN  - 1710569040
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing interest in not only understanding the processes underlying responses to disadvantage, and ways of reducing prejudice, but also to gain insight into how experiences of prejudice and social disadvantage affect the need to address one's disadvantage. Our goal in this issue is to discuss how and when low status group members move from experiences of individual versus collective disadvantage to social change. In this article, we consider the individual coping and social change literature, departing from the analyses of individual-level responses to disadvantage, to those at the collective level, to discuss how both strands of research relate to social change. Throughout this article, we introduce the contributions to this special issue and discuss the caveats and paradoxes they raise with regard to the existent literature.

T1  - Exiles in a Foreign Land
AN  - 1698544858
AB  - Despite documentation of intergroup conflict between African Americans and Irish immigrants during the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, few studies have comparatively considered the beneficence of religion as an adaptive, conciliatory mechanism for the two ethnic groups. Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.

T1  - Friendships Fighting Prejudice: A Longitudinal Perspective on Adolescents' Cross-Group Friendships with Immigrants
AN  - 1679664501
AB  - Increasingly, adolescents are growing up in multiethnic multicultural societies. While intergroup prejudice can threaten the multicultural societal cohesion, intergroup friendships are strong predictors of reduced prejudice. Thus, more research is needed to fully understand the development of intergroup friendships and their relations to less prejudicial attitudes. This study addressed two major developmental research questions: first, whether longitudinal patterns of intergroup friendships of native adolescents (i.e., whether or not a native German adolescent has a friendship with an immigrant at different points in time) relate to changes in rates of prejudice about immigrants. Second, whether these friendship patterns that unfold over time can be predicted by contact opportunities, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control assessed at the beginning of the study. The sample included 372 native German adolescents (14.7 years of age at first assessment, 62.3 % girls) who showed one of four friendship trajectories over the three annual assessments: they either maintained, gained, never had, or lost a friendship with an outgroup peer. In particular, results showed that adolescents who gained an intergroup friendship over the three time points showed a significant decrease in negative prejudice over the study. All four theorized predictors contributed to explain friendship trajectory membership. Generally, adolescents with many opportunities for contact, positive attitudes about contact, perceived positive social norms for contact, and high levels of behavioral control (self-efficacy) were more likely to maintain a friendship with an outgroup member than to follow any of the three other friendship trajectories (gain, lost, or never had). The pattern of predictions differed, however, depending on the specific pairs of friendship trajectories compared.

While observing closely the repositioning of the Romani minorities in the post-Yugoslav space, it explicates that in the case of state dissolution, the unevenness of citizenship does not only manifest in the rights dimension, but also in uneven access to citizenship with regard to new polities.

T1  - Health Insurance Instability Among Older Immigrants: Region of Origin Disparities in Coverage
AN  - 1728662122; 201534219
AB  - Objectives. We provide a detailed analysis of how the dynamics of health insurance coverage (HIC) at older ages differs among Latino, Asian, and European immigrants in the United States. Method. Using Survey of Income and Program Participation data from the 2004 and 2008 panels, we estimate discrete-time event history models to examine first and second transitions into and out of HIC, highlighting substantial differences in hazard rates among immigrants aged 50-64 from Asia, Latin America, and Europe. Results. We find that the likelihood of having HIC at first observation and the rates of gaining and losing coverage within a relatively short time frame are least favorable for older Latino immigrants, although immigrants from all three regions are at a disadvantage relative to native-born non-Hispanic Whites. This disparity among immigrant groups persists even when lower rates of citizenship, greater difficulty with English, and low-skill job placements are taken into account. Discussion. Factors that have contributed to the lower rates and shorter durations of HIC among older immigrants, particularly those from Latin America, may not be easily resolved by the Affordable Care Act. The importance of region of origin and assimilation characteristics for the risk of being uninsured in later life argues that immigration and health care policy should be jointly addressed.

AN  - 1708525278; 201528646
AB  - This paper uses confidential ACS data to compare the characteristics of immigrants from ten Asian and Latino origins and the total foreign born in traditional, emerging, and dispersed areas. The correlates of dispersed settlement were estimated for each group and the total foreign born using multinomial logistic regression. The findings show that the characteristics of immigrants in dispersed settlements differ both within and across national origin groups and also between national groups and the total foreign born. Several relationships, particularly those for education and occupation measures, differ significantly and call into question the homogeneity assumption commonly made by studies of the total foreign born or pan-ethnic groups.

T1  - The “leaning song” – a weapon in organizational conflict
AN  - 2154278519
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present an insider ethnographic account of a series of social confrontations between two mutually opposed groups of officers that took place in an officers’ mess in a remote military garrison in the 1980s. The identity of one of these groups was expressed in a particular song that was sung frequently and noisily in the mess. The analysis of these incidents and their precursors provides an understanding of the social processes in which they were embedded, and the conclusions drawn are generalized into the wider context. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on insider ethnography, using rich description to present the incidents and their background. Analysis is conducted using other research by the author on the organizational culture of Service officers and wider scholarship not specifically related to the Military. Findings – The paper finds that in-groups and out-groups in joint Service populations do not necessarily run along traditional, Service, lines, and that cultural change in the groups concerned was associated with the rapid turnover of their members as they were replaced in the normal postings cycle. It demonstrates that a socially powerful shared cultural element can, if only temporarily, bring unity between rival groups. It also contributes to the scholarship on the power of song as a proclamation of group identity and the intensification of that identity. Originality/value – The main strength of this paper is that it provides an insider’s view of a British military social group, which is extremely rare in the literature, describing social processes that connect to the wider scholarship on song, in-group and out-group behaviour, and cultural change.

AB  - Skin completion has impacted the lives, life chances, and life choices of African American women for centuries. Skin complexion partiality has been an entrenched issue in the African American community. The authors investigate colorism and its effects on African American women's life outcomes. This article provides current data on young women's (between the ages of 18-23) perceptions of colorism. This article also examines the correlation between women with high self-esteem (regardless of their skin complexion) and high achievements in measures of social capital. The study was guided by four research questions: 1. Is skin tone a predictive factor for African American women's social outcomes? 2. To what extent do African-American women distinguish between light and dark complexions? 3. Is there a significant relationship between a woman's skin complexion and her self-esteem? 4. Is the issue of colorism still relevant in the twenty first century. Because colorism is further complicated by racism, classism, and sexism, its paradoxical consequences impact African American women's self-esteem, identity, and social capital.

T1  - From Taboo to Tourist Industry: The Construction of Interracial Intimacies between Black Men and White Women in Colonial and Contemporary Times
AN  - 1667953068; 201509575
AB  - This literature review examines the role emotions play in the construction and regulation of commercialized heterosexual interracial intimacies between White women and Black men, beginning with the strict regulations of the colonial era, and moving to the development of 'romance tourism' in the contemporary era between Northern White women and Black men in the Caribbean. During colonialism, White men constructed a taboo against sexual relationships between White women and Black men in order to ensure their dominance over women in their own racial group and all 'Other' men. In contemporary times, relationships between White women and Black men have moved from taboo and marginalized to touristic attraction, as more middle class White women from the United States head to the Caribbean (and at times Africa) in search of romance with local men, demonstrating the importance that emotions like desire have in (re)producing globalization.

T1  - Political economy and work values: the case of Jews and Arabs in Israel
AN  - 1667949072; 201509624
AB  - Work values among Jews in Israel have been studied for several decades, while there has been no attempt to study work values among Arabs. This article examines and compares the centrality of work and the preferred work goals among Israeli Jews and Arabs and the effect of demographic factors on work values. In 2006 the Meaning-of-Working (MOW) questionnaire was conducted on a representative sample of the Israeli labour force that included Jews and Arabs. The findings reveal significant differences regarding the importance of work and most of the preferred work goals among Jews and Arabs. Overall, the demographic variables hardly explain the value differences among members of the two ethnic groups. The findings can be explained by cultural, social and economic factors and primarily by the Israeli-Arab/Palestinian conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sub-regional conflicts and selective autonomy in J&K: Hill Councils in power
AN  - 1692287986; 201521454
AB  - The State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) is examined here in terms of its unique history, geography and cross-cultural composition. Its three regions are not just historically and culturally distinct but each have sub-regions and religious minorities with their own claims to autonomy and devolved power. The author examines the diversity of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and assesses, from a personal study tour, the successes and failures of Hill Councils that have been established in Leh and Kargil (Ladakh) and the prospect of creating others in the Jammu region. Sub-regionalism becomes a potent force in the absence of strong regional consciousness, he argues. Regionalism in general is a product of India's diversity; sub-regionalism the result of geographic, historical and socio-economic factors - J&K is a case in point.

T1  - Acculturation, Gender, and Health Among Middle Eastern Immigrants in the United States: Evidence from the National Health Interview Survey (2002-2012)
AN  - 1692286860; 201521316
AB  - This study uses data from the 2002-12 National Health Interview Surveys and binary logistic regression techniques to examine the association between acculturation and health for Middle Eastern (ME) immigrants in the United States. Particular attention is given to the gender-specific acculturation-health relationship. Results indicate that, in general, ME immigrants are healthier than U.S.-born whites; ME immigrant men are, on average, healthier than ME immigrant women. The study finds evidence of an association between acculturation and self-rated health. However, the acculturation pattern holds neither for activity limitation nor for chronic health conditions. Male and female ME immigrants of all acculturation levels are less likely to report any activity limitations or any chronic health conditions compared to their U.S.-born counterparts. Findings suggest that future research on ME immigrants and on other immigrant groups should take into account different levels of acculturation when examining the relationship between acculturation and self-rated health by gender.

This article explores the meanings of and reactions to Arab sounds in Israel - political struggles over muezzins, stereotypical representations of Israeli Palestinians as loud, and so on - in order to offer general insights into the role of the sonic (both actual sounds and their discursive representations) in the new 'cultural' racism, in the everyday ethnicized experience of one's body, and in shaping relations between ethnic and national groups.

T1  - Mobilizing African Americans for immigrant rights: Framing strategies in two multi-racial coalitions
AN  - 1738477279; 201538506
AB  - Social movement framing is a critical element in bringing together heterogeneous groups as allies in common political struggle. Immigrant rights organizations, like other social movement groups, must construct framing strategies to mobilize potential adherents, including African Americans and other non-immigrant groups. Drawing on interview data with leaders and members of two Los Angeles grassroots multi-racial coalitions, this article examines the framing strategies and negotiations each makes as they attempt to increase Black participation in the immigrant rights movement. Findings indicate that organizers relied on two prominent rhetorical strategies: the 'immigrant worker' frame centered on an immigrant work ethic, and a more encompassing social and racial 'injustice' frame. Although both carried some appeal, we argue that African Americans' perceptions of labor market competition with immigrants posed significant challenges to building sustainable coalitions. We further demonstrate how inaction and avoidance by activists inhibited potential Black participation in the movement. We conclude with some implications of our findings for the role of social movement frames in fostering new and effective alliances between African Americans and immigrants. .

T1  - Racial history, legacy and economic development
AN  - 1650148381; 201502156
AB  - For more than a century, white communities across the United States employed strategies to remain all-white, including violent acts, forcibly driving minorities out of town, and racist local ordinances. One particularly widespread and effective approach used by many towns to exclude certain groups of people from living there was the creation of a 'sundown town': towns that purposely signalled to African Americans and other non-white groups that they were not welcome within the city limits after dark. Crowe and Ceresola seek to understand how historical racial policies affect present-day community life and, in particular, one component of community with which many towns currently struggle: economic development. In exploring the effect of cultural legacy on perceptions of race and economic development in five mid-sized communities in central and southern Illinois-two former sundown towns and three without histories of racial exclusion-their study uses interviews, observation and content analysis to examine how historical legacy can carry over to the present and affect economic development. Overall, the findings suggest that the values and beliefs passed down through a community's legacy influences current local economic development. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religion and Assimilation Among Turkish Muslim Immigrants: Comparing Practicing and Non-Practicing Muslims
AN  - 1680150667; 201513908
AB  - In the literature on religion and assimilation, Muslims are usually categorized into one group without any reference to their differences in terms of religious practice and ethnicity. This paper sheds light on such differences by illustrating the case of Turkish immigrants in the USA, one of the least studied immigrant groups. Based on interviews with practicing and non-practicing Turkish Muslims in Houston, we address the issue of how practices of religion play its role in the assimilation of Turkish immigrants. Data reveal that while Turks in general are fairly well adapted into American society, there are some major differences between practicing and non-practicing Turkish Muslims, even though practically all Turks identify as Muslim.

T1  - Demotic or demonic? Race, class and gender in 'Gypsy' reality TV
AN  - 1559004937; 201432030
AB  - An intriguing shift in the public interest of Roma, Gypsy and Traveller minorities has been the rise of the 'Gypsy' reality TV star in shows across Europe ('Gypsy' is the word most often used in popular media culture). The latest phenomenon to hit the UK has been the Channel 4 series Big Fat Gypsy Weddings (Firecracker Films, Channel 4, 2010-2013), a flamboyant production that has garnered both huge audience shares and fierce criticism, with commentators berating its narrow, sensationalist focus. Drawing on both specialized literature on Roma minorities and current sociological debates on reality TV formats, this article raises questions about how the politics of the 'demotic turn' of such formats (as noted by Turner in 2004) can lean towards the demonic through emphasizing such groups as spectacular, extraordinary and above all, negatively different. Furthermore, this article shows how the series not only reproduces old stereotypes of Gypsies and Travellers as different, ethnicized others but is also heavily embroiled in UK gender and class discourses. Whilst the series claims to be a unique insight into a marginalized community, this close analysis discusses the wider politics within which it is embedded and how such representations can both popularize and undermine marginalized or minority groups.

T1  - Confidence in the Police: Variation across Groups Classified as Visible Minorities
AN  - 1531931186; 201425541
AB  - Public confidence in the police is obviously important and is likely to vary across racial/cultural groups and across Canada. However, when national data are being used, differences in views are generally examined through the lens of visible minorities as a composite group compared to non-visible minorities. Using data from the 2009 General Social Survey on Victimization, we argue that it is an oversimplification to talk about the views of visible minorities in relation to the police. Such broad categories of people hide the more nuanced manner in which some groups differ from others on some questions in some locations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Host National Identification of Immigrants in the Netherlands
AN  - 1531934077; 201423392
AB  - This study examines immigrants' identification with the host country. We use survey data of more than 1,700 Turkish and Moroccan immigrants and more than 2,200 natives in the Netherlands. We answer four main questions in this study. First, do immigrants have lower national identification than natives? Second, does the level of national identification differ between immigrant groups? Third, do economic and social integration similarly affect national identification among immigrants and natives? And fourth, what are important additional determinants of national identification among immigrants? The results show that, compared to Dutch natives, Turkish but not Moroccan immigrants have lower national identification. Being employed and socially integrated is associated with higher national identification among immigrants as well as natives, but only among immigrants is higher occupational status associated with higher national identification. For immigrants, Dutch language proficiency, perceived discrimination, and contact with natives proved to be important conditions for national identification. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AS MULTIPLE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION? PREDICTORS OF DIGITAL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN SLOVENIA
AN  - 1667951640; 201510731
AB  - A significant decreasing trend in political participation could be observed in so-called Western democracies in the last decades of the 20th century. In this framework, researchers largely agree on the key factors of participation: from generational differences and socio-economic status through civic values to civic competencies. The emergence and expansion of the Internet have brought new opportunities to expand political participation practices and to include in these practices certain groups which have so far been less active. By analysing the presence of various forms of participation via the Internet in Slovenia, we assess a thesis on the (possible) expansion of space for political participation and search for answer(s) to research questions about the relationship between traditional forms of political participation in general and digital forms of participation: a) are online forms merely combining with other traditional forms of participation; or b) are they emerging as a new type of political participation? We also investigate whether digital participation does indeed involve new groups of people and who are potential 'digital citizens'. In the analysis, we use the latest data from the Slovenian Public Opinion Survey 2013, which includes both information on the forms of political participation generally and information on digital-specific forms of participation.

T1  - 'Reel love' across ethnic boundaries? The extent and significance of inter-ethnic intimacy in Australian cinema
AN  - 1520342843; 201413204
AB  - National cinemas play an important role in the construction of national identities, representing the 'self' to both domestic and international audiences. Evidence of the material impacts of media representations on individuals and society, and the pervasiveness of movie-watching as a cultural activity, underscore the importance of scholarly inquiry into film. Here, we are concerned with how ethnic diversity has been negotiated within the Australian national cinema -- specifically at the scale of intimate interpersonal relationships. Our analysis of twenty-five recent Australian films considers how cinema alerts audiences to the possibilities and limitations of love within and across ethnic boundaries. We find cause for modest optimism in regard to the frequency of Australian cinematic representations of inter-ethnic intimacy, although the narrow range of ethnic groups permitted to participate in these encounters, and an apparent reticence to portray marriage, co-habitation and child-bearing across ethnic boundaries, remain cause for concern.

T1  - Linguistic Assimilation of First-Generation Jewish South African Immigrants in Israel
AN  - 1504422508; 201405521
AB  - We contribute to scholarship on the linguistic assimilation of migrants by focusing on the special case of Jewish South African migrants in Israel. English as an international language is widely used in the Israeli society, so immigrants whose mother tongue is English are a very interesting case because they might experience much less social pressure to improve their Hebrew skills than other immigrant groups who speak other languages. The study reveals that, although most first-generation immigrants participated in state-sponsored Hebrew classes and reported relatively moderate levels of language proficiency, it has not become their primary language. Hebrew proficiency proved conditional on age at arrival and rise sharply with tenure in the country and exposure to Hebrew (at origin or at destination). Hebrew proficiency is higher for migrants with more extensive contacts with Israelis and with higher education. Positive synergism emerged between language acquisition and reasons for migrating and attachment to the country. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Premigration Status in the Acculturation of Chinese-Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans
AN  - 1463011682; 201345878
AB  - Drawing from fifty in-depth interviews, this research examines the role of existing parental language knowledge on the ethnic identity negotiation of two ethnically distinct children of immigrant groups-Vietnamese and Chinese-Vietnamese-whose families have emigrated from Vietnam to the Southern California region of the United States. While previous research focused primarily on the influence of premigration status on first-generation immigrants, this article considers how a central aspect of premigration status (intranational ethnicity) applies specifically to the children of first generation immigrants. By taking the premigration approach of comparing the experiences of different ancestral-origin groups from a single nation (the intranational ethnicity perspective), this analysis suggests that a family's premigration ethnic status shapes the 1.5 and second-generation's ethnic self-identification choices through the mediation of parental language knowledge. Specifically, for the children of immigrants with twice-minority status (Chinese-Vietnamese Americans), parental language knowledge serves as an easy ethnic identity default during these children's early self-identification process.

T1  - Kids Talking About Race: Tween-agers in a Post-Civil Rights Era
AN  - 1429629961; 201335827
AB  - Our research examines how American children understand and talk about how race matters in their everyday lives. We draw on interviews with 44 middle school children who attend schools in an integrated county-wide system and find that while some use color-blind rhetoric, most children in our study know that race matters, while they offer alternative accounts for why and how. Some explain race as social inequality, while others offer cultural accounts of racial differences. Our analysis suggests that for white children, gender matters; more girls describe racial inequality than boys. For children of color, class seems to be key, with middle-class children giving cultural explanations, including negative evaluations of others in their own racial group. We use an intersectionality framework to analyze the alternative and complex narratives children give for their own experiences of race and race relations between peers.

T1  - Race and Power: The Potential and Limitations of Prison-Based Democratic Therapeutic Communities
AN  - 1728661154; 201535680
AB  - Race and prisons are deeply intertwined in England and Wales and in other countries. Minority groups not only are overrepresented but also experience the weight and pain of imprisonment more acutely. However, democratic therapeutic community prisons such as HMP Grendon in the United Kingdom offer an alternative to mainstream imprisonment, using communal living as a means to explore psychotherapeutic issues in a humane and effective way. The primary aim of this article is to explore the potential and limitations of prison-based therapeutic communities in responding to individual needs and the wider structural constraints that shape race and ethnicity in contemporary society. The article sets out the context in which these communities operate, in particular the ways in which both prisons and clinical practice are implicated in the flow of racialized power. The article goes on to discuss the features of therapeutic communities that can challenge, confront, disentangle, and reorder aspects of power, inequality, and identity. The article concludes that while therapeutic communities do not provide a utopian answer to the structural problems of race and power, they do offer the potential for a more sensitive internal environment and enable individuals to act with conscious and considered agency in their own lives.

T1  - Expanding Policy-Based Conceptualizations of 'Successful Integration': Negotiating Integration through Occupation following International Migration
AN  - 1417526605; 201331951
AB  - The immigration of French-speakers to Canada and their successful integration into Francophone minority communities has become a priority for the country's federal government. A critical ethnography served to challenge assumptions regarding successful integration embedded within government documents and to raise awareness of the challenges faced by French-speaking immigrants from visible minority groups residing within London, Ontario, Canada. A theoretical framework applying Goffman's concept of performance and Bourdieu's concepts of field, habitus, and capital guided the study. Eight migrants participated in up to five sessions including narrative and in-depth interviews, Occupational Mapping, and participation in occupations. Findings highlight that integration involves a process of 'starting over,' which entails becoming aware of differences in fields and habitus within and between home and host societies, learning 'how things work' in the host community, and negotiating performances in social interactions. This negotiation, enacted primarily through occupation, is influenced by differential access to forms of capital. It is further related to ways immigrants' intersecting identity markers are constructed within particular places and embedded in broader social systems and structures. These findings challenge the linear and individualized process of integration identified within government documents, and the narrow focus on economic productivity as the occupation-based marker of integration.

T1  - Ubuntu in S. M. Kapwepwe's Shalapo Canicandala: Insights for Afrocentric Psychology
AN  - 1463008712; 201345843
AB  - The year is 1884. Somewhere in Central Africa is a vast Bantu kingdom known as luBemba. The people are abaBemba. Somewhere else, and unbeknownst to abaBemba, European nations are sharing African land including that of abaBemba. Consequent to this "scramble for Africa," abaBemba find themselves in an arbitrary amalgamation of 70-plus ethnic groups. The amalgam is Northern Rhodesia. Bemba sociopolitical systems collapse. Young men are forced into mine labor for tax money. Mine townships bring together cultures from Africa, India, and Britain. For abaBemba, this experience is characterized by a multilayered psychological destabilization. Taking advantage of the onset of the written text, Bemba authors delineate for their kinsfolk an Afrocentric space around their new sociopolitical reality. These novelists are neither psychologists nor conventional philosophers; yet their literary treatment of the African psyche is profound. From one such novelist, this article draws insights for Afrocentric psychology. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia
AN  - 1347783987; 201318829
AB  - It is striking to observe the virtual absence of an established literature on race and racism in the discussion of Islamophobia; something that is only marginally more present in the discussion of antisemitism. This special issue of Ethnic and Racial Studies locates the contemporary study of antisemitism and Islamophobia squarely within the fields of race and racism. As such it problematizes the extent to which discussion of the racialization of these minorities remains unrelated to each other, or is explored in distinct silos as a series of internal debates. By harnessing the explanatory power of long-established organizing concepts within the study of race and racism, this special issue makes a historically informed, theoretical and empirical contribution to aligning these analytical pursuits.

T1  - Interethnic tolerance among multiethnic youth: Accommodating differences in the construction of social citizenship
AN  - 1531933688; 201423222
AB  - A pluralistic nation like Malaysia needs an extremely organised and sensible society in order to be fruitfully tolerant. Living in a plural community demands a strong willingness to accommodate different ethnic expectations. Tolerance is crucial for the achievement of the right kind of community. It takes a collective voice among all the communities on the character of the nation they want to live in, and the respective rights and obligations within it to overcome the challenge of managing a diverse society, more so in a multiethnic one. The nature of a tolerant society inclined its members to be attentive and open to form a relationship that is continuous and reliable. To understand youth's life experience in regards to growing up amidst a multi-ethnic milieu, we have to explore their experiences to see how they are able to adapt and assimilate. This is an important aspect of fostering understanding with the different ethnic groups with motives that contribute to the formation of social citizenship and a participatory democracy. This research will focus on how Malaysian youth make sense of the seemingly calm and peaceful nation and how their negotiations and resolutions relate to their qualitative citizenship in a multi-ethnic society.

T1  - ANALYZING BEHAVIORS INFLUENCING USE OF MOBILE COUPONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TRANSACTION UTILITY
AN  - 1531933043; 201422957
AB  - The authors have explored the antecedents of mobile coupon use based on acquisition-transaction utility theory, and the technology acceptance model. They have analyzed data collected from 365 mobile phone users in Taiwan and developed a theoretical and empirical model. The results indicate that, consumers with a higher degree of coupon proneness are more likely to recognize the usefulness of mobile coupons, and have more positive attitudes and behavioral intention toward coupon use. Both consumers' perceived usefulness and attitudes toward use appeared to have an equal and positive impact on their behavioral intention to use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Deconstructing Good Times and The Cosby Show
AN  - 1825325868
AB  - As countless critics of The Cosby Show (1984-1992) would have us believe, the Huxtable family, as portrayed and envisioned by educator and comedian Bill Cosby, is not the traditional representation of Black family life. For many critics, as well as some Cosby show defenders, the experience depicted by the fictional Huxtable family was the unique experience of too few African Americans at the time; the suggestion is that the family is very wealthy. Contrary to the moral majority, its critics and defenders, I am not from the upper or middle classes like the Huxtable family; however, I identified with The Cosby Show more than with its predecessors, like Good Times (1974-1979). African Americans are no different than any other American group, and therefore, as writer and novelist Wendy Alexia Rountree suggests in her article "'Faking the Funk': A Journey Towards Authentic Blackness," we "should be allowed to develop individual identities that are not considered in conflict with our ethnic group identity but as a legitimate part of it." Consequently, as someone who identifies with The Cosby Show ; who is an autistic, working-class Black female from the projects of East Harlem with two Ivy League degrees; and for whom cowboy boots are her footwear of choice, I say, take Good Times and The Cosby Show if you must, but leave me my Black experience.

T1  - Re-making a Frontier Community or Defending Ethnic Boundaries? The Caucasus in Cossack Identity
AN  - 1504423169; 201405517
AB  - The essay focuses on the notion of the Caucasus as a reference point in the construction of Cossack identity in southern Russia. Since the late Soviet period, the Cossack revivalist/nativist movement has emerged in the territories which constituted the frontier zones of Tsarist Russia. Arguably, the historical Cossack hosts were established as a kind of frontier community which played an important role in the expansion of the Russian Empire. This essay examines how post-Soviet Cossacks reinterpret the meanings of the Caucasus as a spatial and cultural realm where, or in relation to which, they produce their identity as a distinct ethnic and cultural community.

T1  - The problems of owning culture: global intellectual property law and 'traditional' community arts in Indonesia
AN  - 1551001896; 201428884
AB  - In our digital age when most movies viewed at home carry Interpol warnings that copyright piracy is a crime, yet patented medicines are unaffordable for millions, ethical debates about intellectual property rights and freedom of information are becoming widespread. But a less noticed topic in these debates is the recent international effort to expand and implement Euro-American models of intellectual property law among peoples whose daily activities previously have not been covered by formal intellectual property laws (primarily copyright, patent, and trademark regulations). This essay considers how this trend is unfolding in post-Suharto Indonesia, particularly the tension between national efforts to create legal property rights over cultural resources and the fact that most ordinary Indonesians do not view their cultural knowledge and aesthetic or ritual activities as property to be claimed in an exclusive way by their ethnic group or government. Plans to legalize the cultural ownership of regional arts are addressed with ethnographic examples from Indonesian fieldwork including 2005-07 visits conducted by an international team of lawyers, musicologists, anthropologists, and Indonesian community activists with 'traditional' arts producers from eleven cultural regions in eight provinces. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Framing of Islam and Muslims in the Tenth Anniversary Coverage of 9/11: Implications for Reconciliation and Moving On
AN  - 1550998909; 201429084
AB  - This article analyses Australian television news programmes' framing of the tenth anniversary of the events of 9/11. Our findings build on and reaffirm the earlier work we did in this area-showing that television news programmes in Australia have moved away from conflating terrorism with Muslims and Islam. We found that the tenth anniversary coverage was presented with the frames of 'reconciliation' and 'moving on' from 9/11. The dominant frame used by Australian television news was based on the US-Australia relations, including a shared worldview, common experiences of lives lost in the attacks and a unified response in the context of the 'war on terror'. Notably absent from the coverage was the attribution of references to bridge-building with Muslim minority communities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The challenge of diversity management: police reform and the Arab minority in Israel
AN  - 1315600790; 201309368
AB  - Diverse societies present different challenges for police forces that have to gain the trust and legitimacy of minorities. Police forces must develop the ability to engage with diversity and overcome their own biases and prejudices in order to better serve minorities. Police reforms, however, may fail to address the challenge successfully if core problems are not clearly identified. In such a case, reforms may be misdirected and fail to achieve the desired results. This paper, based on a study of the Arab minority in Israel, suggests a bottom-up approach that concentrates on identifying the attitudes of minority groups as the basis for any reform plan. A survey was conducted among Arab citizens to identify general attitudes, perceptions of over-policing and under-policing and assessment of three potential reforms; recruitment of minority members into the police, community involvement in policing, and cultural training for police officers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Group self-determination, individual rights, or social inclusion? Competing frames for ethnic counting in Hungary
AN  - 1283642650; 201303367
AB  - Despite increasing demand from policymakers and academics alike, effective policies on ethnic data collection for social inclusion purposes are still absent in most of Europe. This paper proposes to explain the failure to produce these policies by the coexistence of and tensions among contradictory frames on ethnic counting. An in-depth analysis of Hungarian policies reveals that three mutually inconsistent policy frames connect ethnic counting to ethnic diversity in many different ways. These frames are group self-determination, individual rights, and social inclusion. This paper illustrates the tensions among the three through a discussion of two core but divisive aspects of collecting ethnic statistics: defining ethnic classifications for counting and defining membership in ethnic groups for policy purposes. Tensions among the three result in inconsistent and inefficient policies of ethnic counting. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Measurement Invariance across Face-to-Face and Telephone Modes: The Case of Minority-Status Collectivistic-oriented Groups
AN  - 1125220996; 201241148
AB  - This article tests the implications of mode selection on measurement equivalence in interview-administered surveys among minorities using a Multi-Group Multiple Indicators-Multiple Causes Model. A measurement invariance test procedure comparing face-to-face and telephone modes was performed on an attitude scale concerning social integration between Arabs and Jews. The scale was measured in two surveys conducted simultaneously among the Arab minority in Israel. Hypotheses regarding mode effect on the measurement model parameters (mean, intercept, loading, and error variance) were formulated, with reference to three mediators: Cognitive burden, motivation, and threat of disclosure. The results partially supported the hypotheses: Face-to-face mode was fully superior with regard to item random error (reliability), was partially superior with regard to item systematic error, but was not superior with regard to item validity. The configural, metric, partial scalar, and latent factor mean invariance found in this study are an indication that such data sets may be combined cautiously. Implications are discussed for researchers using telephone or mixed modes for data collection in surveys dealing with sensitive topics among collectivistic-oriented minority-status groups.

T1  - Influences of the Campus Experience on the Ethnic Identity Development of Students of Color
AN  - 1030869169; 201227801
AB  - This qualitative research study examined ethnic identity development among underrepresented students of color at a selective, research intensive, predominantly White university. The objective focused on influences of the campus experience on students' ethnic identity development when they entered and as they prepared to graduate from college. Students were asked to reflect on how development of their ethnic identity intersected with outcomes as critical thinking, communication skills, and sense of competence. Findings include an increased learning about one's ethnic group has cognitive and noncognitive benefits. Students felt further development of their ethnic identity had a considerable, positive impact on their sense of competence, sense of belonging, interpersonal relationships, and commitments. Institutional and policy implications are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright Corwin Press Inc.]

T1  - Diaspora: The Politics of Its Meanings
AN  - 1037875379; 201232173
AB  - A key aspect of diaspora research in international relations should be on the ontological politics of naming migrants, travelers, nomads, guest workers, minorities, their relations, and their politics "diasporic." Academic debates about the definitions of diaspora are endless; not only is this quest largely a waste of time, but it marginalizes a more important issuenamely, the politicality of defining a population or a set of relations as "diasporic." I draw here on the notion of "ontological politics," as developed within actor network theory by John Law and Annemarie Mol (Mol 1999). In her work on clinical practices, Mol demonstrates that a disease such as anemia is not a single reality. It is performed in at least two different ways that depend on the methods through which it is diagnosed and therefore "made real": (i) the analysis of external symptoms by a doctor and (ii) the analysis of hemoglobin levels in a laboratory. What Mol shows is that these are not just different ways at getting at the same preexisting phenomenon but rather that the two methods produce two broadly similar yet distinct realities.

T1  - Ethnic Conflict and the Politics of Greed: Rethinking Chimamanda Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun
AN  - 1429623971; 201335846
AB  - The African continent today is laced with some of the most intractable conflicts, most of them based on ethnic nationalism. More often than not, this has led to poor governance, unequal distribution of resources, state collapse, high attrition of human resources, economic decline, and inter-ethnic clashes. This essay seeks to examine Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun through the lens of ethnic conflict. It begins by tracing the history and manifestations of ethnic stereotypes and ethnic cleavage in African imaginaries. The essay then argues that group loyalty in Nigeria led to the creation of 'biafranization' or 'fear of the Igbo factor' in the Hausa-Fulani and the various other ethnic groups that sympathized with them; a fear that crystallized into a thirty-month state-sponsored bulwark campaign aimed at finding a 'final solution' to a 'problem population'. Finally, the essay contends that Adichie's Half of a Yellow Sun anatomizes the impact of ethnic cleavage on the civilian Igbo population during the Nigeria-Biafra civil war. Adichie, I argue, participates in an ongoing re-invention of how Africans can extinguish the psychology of fear that they are endangered species when they live side by side with people who do not belong to their 'tribe'.

T1  - The propensity toward reconciliation among young people in Northern Ireland and Croatia: The role of conflict management styles within the family
AN  - 1018354248; 201212743
AB  - Two studies, conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 266) and Croatia (N = 261), examined the role of constructive adolescents-parents conflict management style (CAPCMS) in predicting inter-group reconciliation attitudes. We hypothesized that CAPCMS would be a unique and positive predictor of reconciliation attitudes over and above other common predictors of reconciliation attitudes, such as inter-group contact quantity and quality, and the experience of inter-group conflict. Findings from Study 1 supported this hypothesis. Study 2 replicated these findings in a different cultural context and extended them by examining the robustness of the relationship between CAPCMS and reconciliation attitudes in the presence of an individual difference measure (self-confidence in social interactions). Furthermore, both studies revealed that for adolescents with high CAPCMS the relationships between intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and reconciliation attitudes were more accentuated, and their reconciliation attitudes were less affected by their experience of conflict, relative to those with low CAPCMS.

T1  - Social Integration in Post-Multiculturalism: An Analysis of Social Integration Policy in Post-war Britain
AN  - 964190351; 201207376
AB  - Social integration is one of the most urgent issues in Western countries, where cultural diversity has been recognized to make social unity danger. In the past, social integration used to be tackled by multiculturalism, which was an effort to recognize cultural diversity as a positive aspect of society. However, multiculturalism is losing the moral support of society because multiculturalism itself could not be a social glue among different people; rather it is thought to make society unstable. Thus, a new philosophy and policy is required to manage the issues of social integration in a globalized social environment. In order to create social integration, on one hand, people with different backgrounds need to share the same concept of society. On the other hand, people have to become accustomed to cultural diversity. However, this is not easily accomplished because both measures for social integration seem to be politically contradictory and incompatible. How, and by what reasons, could these two conditions of social integration be satisfied? To answer this question, this paper scrutinizes the changes in social integration policy in post-war Britain. I divide social integration policy in Britain into three stages focusing on the relationship between social unity and cultural diversity: from after World War II to 1979; Thatcher's and Major's Conservative Governments; and Blair's new Labour Government. The social integration policy and philosophy of the new Labour Government in particular is important because it represents post-multiculturalism discourse for social integration. The Labour Government tried to establish social integration by introducing an abstract common identity, which both the majority and minority groups could accept and which is compatible with various cultural or religious conventions and teaching, as it were, citizenship and Britishness, as a set of liberal values. Although the Labour Government's policy itself was controversial, it is giving us a reference point for the debate on social integration in a post-multicultural era. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trends in educational attainment by race/ethnicity, nativity, and sex in the United States, 1989-2005
AN  - 919903724; 201201638
AB  - Despite the importance of education for shaping individuals' life chances, little research has examined trends and differences in educational attainment for detailed demographic subpopulations in the United States. We use labour market segmentation and cohort replacement theories, linear regression methods, and data from the National Health Interview Survey to understand educational attainment by race/ethnicity, nativity, birth cohort, and sex between 1989 and 2005 in the United States. There have been significant changes in educational attainment over time. In support of the cohort replacement theory, we find that across cohorts, females have enjoyed greater gains in education than men, and for some race/ethnic groups, recent cohorts of women average more years of education than comparable men. And in support of labour market segmentation theories, foreign-born Mexican Americans continue to possess relatively low levels of educational attainment. Our results can aid policymakers in identifying vulnerable populations, and form the base from which to better understand changing disparities in education. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Recent research has shown that White women's bias against Black men increases with elevated fertility across the menstrual cycle. We demonstrate that the association between fertility and intergroup bias is not limited to groups defined by race, but extends to group categories that are minimally defined, and may depend on the extent to which women associate out-group men with physical formidability. In Study 1, Black and White women with strong associations between the racial out-group and physical formidability displayed greater bias against out-group men as conception risk increased. Study 2 replicated these results in a minimal-group paradigm. These findings are consistent with the notion that women may be endowed with a psychological system that generates intergroup bias via mechanisms that rely on categorization heuristics and perceptions of the physical formidability of out-group men, particularly when the costs of sexual coercion are high.

T1  - Molders of Mud: Ethnogenesis and Rwanda's Twa
AN  - 902080014; 201122325
AB  - When discussing the politics of ethnicity in Rwanda, most authors discount the role of Twa. Because the latter are Rwanda's least numerous ethnic group, the tendency is to dismiss their importance. This dismissal may seem justified in instrumental terms, but it is not true in symbolic terms. Twa were the first of Rwanda's three ethnicities to suffer stigmatization, and this predated European colonialism by several centuries. If we think about ethnicity according to an instrumentalist model, placing primary causal weight on social rather than cultural factors, we misconstrue how Rwanda's pre-colonial opposition of disgust vs. esteem provided fertile grounds for later European biological determinism. Practices of avoidance in commensality, marriage, and other activities -- called 'kuneena batwa' -- lie at the heart of this opposition. This paper traces its processual development, demonstrating that it is incorrect to think of Rwandan ethnicity either in purely instrumentalist terms or in simple binary cultural terms.

T1  - New Immigrants -- Old Disadvantage Patterns? Labour Market Integration of Recent Immigrants into Germany
AN  - 852900160; 201103285
AB  - This paper examines the labour market integration of immigrants who have entered Germany since 1990, and compares their situation with that of their predecessors. The analyses based on the cumulative micro-census data reveal that recent immigrants into Germany are on average better-educated than their earlier counterparts, and some ethnic groups are even better- educated than the national average. Despite their high levels of formal education, these immigrants coming mostly from Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East face severe integration problems in the German labour market. Thus, after taking into account the value of human capital represented by these immigrants, their ethnic disadvantages appear to increase. This stands in sharp contrast with the disadvantages faced by 'classic' immigrants who arrived in Germany during the 1960s and 1970s, for whom lack of human capital had been identified as the main obstacle to labour market integration.

T1  - Immigrants in Denmark: Access to Employment, Class Attainment and Earnings in a High-Skilled Economy
AN  - 852898085; 201103181
AB  - This study examines employment access, class attainment, and earnings among native-born and first-generation immigrants in Denmark using Danish administrative data from 2002. Results suggest large gaps in employment access between native-born Danes and immigrants, as well as among immigrant groups by country of origin and time of arrival. Non-Western immigrants and those arriving after 1984 are at a particular disadvantage compared to other immigrants, a finding not explained by education differences. Immigrants are more likely to be employed in unskilled manual jobs and less likely to be employed in professional and intermediate-level positions than native-born Danes, although the likelihood of obtaining higher-level positions increases as immigrants' time in Denmark lengthens. Class attainment and accumulated work experience explain a significant portion of native-immigrant gaps in earnings, but work experience reduces native-immigrant gaps in class attainment for lower-level positions only. The Danish 'flexicurity' model and its implications for immigrants living in Denmark are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of Exemplar Versus Prototype-Based Media Primes on Racial/Ethnic Evaluations
AN  - 907928728; 201124734
AB  - This study examined the individual and combined effects of exposure to positive Latino exemplars and prototypes in the media on White audience members' attitudes about and judgments regarding Latinos in society. Although it was expected that exposure to these favorable models would promote positive evaluations of Latinos among White consumers, the extent to which one mode of presentation could be privileged in the production of more beneficial outcomes was uncertain based on existing research. These results cautiously indicate that while prototypes may offer some advantages in terms of reducing stereotyping, both exemplar- and prototype-based characterizations of positive race-related media content (alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers' perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - Sociopolitical Integration as a Mode of Progressive Race, Gender and Class in United States
AN  - 1125217630; 201240426
AB  - This paper reassesses the tension between minority sociopolitical integration and differences in sociopolitical trust within the framework of conflict theory. Conflict theory posits that in the United States system of government, political systems are used by elites to solidify and/or maintain their relative social advantages over the less fortunate. Minority groups have been shut-out of the sociopolitical nexus until fairly recently, and available evidence of the long-term effects of the sociopolitical integration suggests that continuation of sociopolitical trust may reduce the socio-political gap between minority and majority population. Yet even conflict theory predicts that minority sociopolitical upliftment, and corresponding occupational gains, are threats to the status quo and therefore, be opposed by those who are threatened by such gains. Similarly, shifting and multilayered levels of what is sociopolitical integration and what is sociopolitical trust in a particular context are addressed in the explication of this work.

T1  - Motivation losses in teamwork: The effects of team diversity and equity sensitivity on reactions to free-riding
AN  - 1018356366; 201212737
AB  - Team diversity may lead to a categorization of teammates as ingroup versus outgroup members. Therefore, the question arises whether there would be more permissiveness in reaction to ingroup free-riders than outgroup free-riders. To test this hypothesis, subjects were randomly assigned to one of two reward conditions (equity versus equality) and had to work with a partner who obviously underachieved and supposedly belonged to the same or a different group with regard to cognitive style. In addition, we assessed subjects' individual sensitivity to equity norms, assuming that this would be a further moderator of the sucker effect. As expected, significant interaction effects on individual performance occurred for both variables. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Across the Oceans: Childcare and Grandparenting in UK Chinese and Bangladeshi Households
AN  - 818800220; 201072227
AB  - This paper focuses on the transnational aspects of childcare, highlighting the importance of migration history and the relevance of social networks in understanding how childcare needs are met in different minority ethnic communities. Fifteen households from the Chinese and Bangladeshi communities in the United Kingdom were surveyed, and interviews were conducted with grandparents, parents and children. The role of grandparents in these communities is used to illustrate the importance of intergenerational and transnational relationships, and commonalities and differences between the two communities are highlighted. The paper offers an alternative way of understanding minority ethnic communities' needs. The approach employed may also be applied to other minority ethnic groups in Europe and beyond. At a time when UK border controls are being tightened, the paper adds to the growing body of literature on diasporas, migration and transnationalism, but with a particular focus on childcare as a policy area.

T1  - "Living in Perfect Harmony": A Multiethnic Catholic Parish on the Minnesota Prairie, 1881-1910
AN  - 764424394; 201064740
AB  - Explores the late-19th-century pluralistic, multiethnic Catholic parish, Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church (IHM) in Currie, MN, in terms of accounting for its longevity, ie, its success & unity despite parishioner ethnic & linguistic difference. The origins & development of IHM is traced from its founding by Bishop John Ireland & John Sweetman. Interethnic cooperation in church matters as a direct offshoot of extensive interaction outside the church is cited as the key reason for IHM's success as a multiethnic parish. This community interaction is described, & the role of Oliver & Ann Drinville as "cultural brokers" between Currie's disparate religious, socioeconomic, & ethnic groups is explained. Attention is then given to the character of cooperation in the church. D. Edelman

T1  - Intergroup evaluations, group indispensability and prototypicality judgments: A study in Mauritius
AN  - 758124161; 201056724
AB  - This paper focuses on the superordinate (national)-subgroup (ethnic) association in relation to group identifications, relative ingroup indispensability, relative ingroup prototypicality and their effects on outgroup and ingroup evaluations. Survey data were collected from a large sample of Mauritian adolescents (N = 1,784) from three ethnic groups (Hindus, Muslims, Creoles). National and dual identifiers were more positive towards the outgroups than ethnic identifiers. Furthermore, relative ingroup prototypicality and relative ingroup indispensability were empirically distinguishable constructs. The Creoles, who are of lower status, had higher scores on both these measures. Also it turned out that relative ingroup indispensability and relative ingroup prototypicality were independently associated to respectively more negative outgroup evaluation and more positive ingroup evaluation. The findings give a differentiated view of the idea that a complex representation of the superordinate category fosters outgroup acceptance.

T1  - Gay Mexican Pornography at the Intersection of Ethnic and National Identity in Jorge Diestra's La Putiza
AN  - 749354374
AB  - This article aims to offer an analysis of the way that issues of national and ethnic self identity are structured and constructed in Mexican gay pornography. Unlike theorists who regard pornography as a matter of sex discrimination and argue that it simply undermines any positive attitudes towards homosexuality, this article argues that Mexican gay male pornography has served as a point of self reference for homosexual men in the country, while it has also helped to foster a degree of visibility for the gay community in mainstream culture. Through an analysis of the film La Putiza (2006), made by the emerging porn house Mecos Films, it will be demonstrated that Mexican male homosexuals do not regard pornography as a cultural product intended to the objectification of the gay community and its members. This film clearly stresses ethnic and national identity as the basis to contest the hegemony of Anglo-European gay pornography in which notions of Latin(o) identity have been caricaturised and heavily troped. This film borrows elements that are pertinent to the specificity of the national gay imagery, as well as film genres that are regarded as quintessentially Mexican. Therefore, the combination of Aztec heritage narrative and wrestling subtexts permit to posit this film as an alternative to the kind of images of Latin(o) homosexuality that are portrayed in Western pornography, while it also stresses national identity by using themes that circulate in the national imaginary as exclusively Mexican. In short, the emerging Mexican gay pornographic industry and the film that it produces prove to be a site of contestation of the hegemony of "Latinised" images that have been offered in foreign pornographic accounts, while they also become a site of validation for gay men whose physicality or ethnic heritage has been rejected within the politics of the erotic.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Membership Status and Subjective Group Dynamics: Who Triggers the Black Sheep Effect?
AN  - 754039706; 201049575
AB  - In 3 experiments, participants (Ns = 50, 95, and 75, respectively) judged 2 ingroup or outgroup members who occupied 1 of 3 statuses-new members, full members, or marginal members. In each case, 1 of these members adopted a normative position and another supported a deviant position regarding a relevant issue. Participants upgraded normative ingroup full members and derogated deviant ingroup full members compared with all other members. In addition, derogation of deviant ingroup members was associated with a socializing and a punishing intention toward new members and full members, respectively. These results are discussed in terms of the group socialization model (e.g., Levine & Moreland, 1994) and the subjective group dynamics model (e.g., Marques, Paez, & Abrams, 1998).

T1  - Social insertion and racial prejudice: Distance from black people and socio-political variables: [1]
AN  - 1540513725
AB  - This article analyses the relationships between racial prejudice (flagrant and symbolic) and university students' membership of socio-political groups, their adhesion to political ideologies, and their attitudes related to the developed and developing worlds. A total of 418 students participated in the study. The results show a negative correlation between adhesion to left-wing ideology and social distance from black people. They also show that favourable attitudes to the developed world are positively correlated to the distance from black people. Finally, group memberships in social movements and in affective-religious communities inhibit the expression of symbolic racial prejudice. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Divergent Streams: Race-Gender Achievement Gaps at Selective Colleges and Universities
AN  - 758121778; 201057009
AB  - In this paper, we extend previous research on racial performance gaps at twenty-eight selective U.S. colleges and universities by examining differences in grade achievement and graduate rates across race-gender categories. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NLSF), we show that Black males, Black females, and Hispanic males attain significantly lower grades than other race-gender groups, and that Black males are thirty-five percent less likely to graduate on-time than other race-gender groups. Analyses consider an array of personal and institutional indicators of academic performance. Grades and graduation rates are improved by academic preparation (particularly high school grade point average), scholarly effort, and, for graduation rates, membership in career-oriented or majority-White campus groups. Grade performance and graduation rates are undermined by a hostile racial climate on campus, family stress, and stereotype threat, all of which disproportionately affect minority students. We conclude with recommendations to college administrators for ways of selecting and supporting minority students to reduce differentials in academic achievement across race-gender groups.

T1  - Desirable Difference: The Shadow of Racial Stereotypes in Creating Transracial Families through Transnational Adoption
AN  - 743043287; 201026574
AB  - The article analyzes how parents decide to adopt a child transnationally by detailing how the meaning of race is articulated in the formation of family. Drawing from my interviews with adoptive parents, I examine how they internalize ideas about different racial groups. For example, I investigate how what they have learned from the adoption agencies, their own perceptions of racial stereotypes, and their perceptions of the communities in which they reside influence their understanding of race. The article suggests that adoptive parents, when considering whether to adopt children from the U.S. or overseas, use a criteria dictated by racial stereotypes in understanding Asian Americans as the model minority, African-Americans as a deficient group, and Latinos occupying an intermediary position.

T1  - From ethnic cleansing to affirmative action: exploring Poland's struggle with its Ukrainian minority (1944-89)
AN  - 60353244; 201017556
AB  - ABSTRACT. The ambivalent attitude of Poland's communist leadership towards Poland's minorities - on the one hand violent and severely repressive, while on the other hand allowing for controlled liberties and offering protection - is the main focus of this article. In the mid-1940s, Poland's new communist leadership proceeded to expel and deport millions of Germans, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Ukrainians from their native territories. A decade later, the communist government adopted a policy that aimed at the reduction of discrimination and the creation of equal social and economic opportunities for the country's residual minority populations. This article explores the background of the wavering communist nationalities policies by focusing on Poland's Ukrainians. It demonstrates how the seemingly contradictory policies of ethnic cleansing and affirmative action were prompted by the same underlying political motivations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Real Italians and wogs: The discursive construction of Italian identity among first generation Italian immigrants in Western Australia
AN  - 743045448; 201026645
AB  - We explore the discursive construction of Italian identity among a bilingual sample of Italian-born Western Australians. Focus groups were held with two groups: Italians who had migrated to Australia as children and a group who had migrated as adults. We found intra- and inter-individual differences in identity construction, with much discourse devoted to demonstrating Italian authenticity and negotiating ethnic category boundaries. Shared markers of authenticity included language, heritage and food. The groups varied in their selection of referent groups to make authenticity claims, with the child migrants drawing upon the shared Australian stereotype of wogs to construct and authenticate their Italian-ness. In contrast, adult migrants constructed Italian identity through comparisons with the dominant Australian ethnic group and in relation to a broader migrant identity. The findings highlight the fluid and complex nature of ethnic identity and the need for further exploration of how it is constructed in talk. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Intra-ethnic fissures in ethnic movements: the rise of Mohajir identity politics in post-1971 Pakistan
AN  - 743042715; 201026657
AB  - The article charts the rise of Mohajir identity politics in Pakistan since 1971. Most accounts of Mohajir identity politics have focused mainly on one actor, that is, the Mohajir (now Muttahida) Qaumi Movement and their politics and secondly, have remained silent on intra-ethnic fissures within the Mohajir community. The present article builds on and criticises such accounts for their partiality and presents a more nuanced understanding of politics within the Mohajir community. On the theoretical plane, it criticises modernist and primordialist accounts of ethnicity and nationalism, both of which portray a homogenous picture of ethnic groups as based on unity and shared aims. It is shown that unity and shared aims are at best, a chimera, and that intra-ethnic fissure is as important to understand as is inter-ethnic conflict when it comes to analysing ethnic movements.
