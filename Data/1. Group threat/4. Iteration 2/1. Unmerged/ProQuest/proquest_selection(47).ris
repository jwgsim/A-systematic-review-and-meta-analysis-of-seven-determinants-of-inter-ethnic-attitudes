T1  - An aversive racism explanation for the influence of race, SES, and race-stereotypical crimes on jury decision biases against East Asian American defendants
AN  - 2661755855
AB  - Aversive racism, a subtle form of contemporary racism for persons who may hold egalitarian values, has been used to explain prejudice by jurors toward Black American and Latinx American defendants, but has yet to examine East Asian American defendants as targets of prejudice. After conducting a pilot study to find race-stereotypical crimes for Asian Americans and White Americans, the purpose of the main study was to examine mock jurors’ prejudice toward East Asian American defendants from an aversive racism perspective. A 2 (Race: White American or East Asian American) x 2 (SES: low or high) x 2 (Race-Stereotypical Crime: embezzlement or computer hacking) between-subjects design was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to read one of eight trial vignettes describing the crime the defendant had allegedly committed. They were then asked to render a verdict, recommend a sentence, and rate the defendant on various culpability and trait measures. Results showed mock jurors sentenced the low SES East Asian American defendant who committed a race-stereotypical crime more punitively than all other conditions. Mock jurors also found this defendant more culpable and rated him more negatively on a number of trait ascriptions. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Problematising mainstream Spanish antiracism: race, racism and whiteness
AN  - 2631378504
AB  - In Spain, (anti-)racism is of scarce relevance to public debates and, when the topic is broached, it has mainly been discussed in relation to non-EU migration. Besides, its historical link with colonialism generally remains unacknowledged. This article analyses the problematisation of ‘race’ and ‘racism’ in this context, as performed by hegemonic stakeholders (i.e. public servants, NGOs, experts) in the fields of anti-discrimination, Roma inclusion and immigrant integration policies. As the fieldwork materials illustrate, this understanding rejects ‘race’ not only from a scientific-biological perspective but also as a social-political category. Accordingly, racism is depoliticised and theorised in a twofold manner: (1) as a matter of stereotypes, prejudices and lack of information about the ‘Other’; (2) as the aggressive acts of explicitly racist individuals/organisations. The structural, historical and institutional dimensions of racism are addressed either as background context, or they are negated by public policies. By not confronting the uneven power relations (re)produced by racism, this approach reaffirms ‘institutional whiteness’ as the underlying perspective of mainstream Spanish anti-racism.

T1  - Profiling racial prejudice during COVID‐19: Who exhibits anti‐Asian sentiment in Australia and the United States?
AN  - 2605007301
AB  - Following the COVID‐19 outbreak, anti‐Asian racism increased around the world, as exhibited through greater instances of abuse and hate crimes. To better understand the scale of anti‐Asian racism and the characteristics of people who may be expressing racial prejudice, we sampled respondents in Australia and the United States over 31 August–9 September 2020 (1375 Australians and 1060 Americans aged 18 or above; source YouGov). To address potential social desirability bias, we use both direct and indirect (list experiment) questions to measure anti‐Asian sentiment and link these variables to key socioeconomic factors. We find that, instead of being universal among general populations, anti‐Asian sentiment is patterned differently across both country contexts and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, the most significant predictor of anti‐Asian bias is political affiliation. By contrast, in Australia, anti‐Asian bias is closely linked to a wide range of socioeconomic factors including political affiliation, age, gender, employment status and income.

T1  - Social Distance Reexamined: European Ancestry Groups in the Early Twentieth‐Century United States
AN  - 2548060335
AB  - Emory Bogardus' 1926 social distance survey revealed, not surprisingly, that native‐born Americans tended to view Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) Europeans as far less desirable than Northern and Western (NW) Europeans for most social relationships. This well‐known finding has been attributed to both racial/ethnic prejudice and social class prejudice. The present study investigates the relative contributions of these two forms of prejudice to the total prejudice against SCE Europeans, testing the prediction that social distance attitudes toward European groups in Bogardus' pioneering survey were significantly influenced by group differences in socioeconomic status (SES), net of the NW‐SCE European distinction. The prediction is supported in analyses that consider survey respondents' uniquely intense desires for social distance from those SCE Europeans that were visible because of their relatively high SES, notably, Russian‐ancestry Jews. The study concludes that social class prejudice substantially affected divisions among European ancestry groups in early twentieth‐century America.

T1  - Dual identity, conflict, and education: an exploration of the lived experience of social relationships of young British Muslim women who attend British universities
AN  - 2509111687
AB  - Previous research concerned with British Muslim women has explored a range of important issues. However, what is missing is research exploring the lived everyday social experiences, including the unique nature of identity formation in British Muslims. This qualitative study tried to address this gap. Five female British Muslims were interviewed, and their interviews analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Three key themes emerged from the data: Constructing identity, Experiencing prejudice in interactions, and Educating oneself and others. The findings demonstrate the complex nature of being a British Muslim woman, the impact of discrimination from various sources and the gendered nature of these experiences. It also highlights the active nature of identity formation, which occurs within and relates to a particular setting and particular experiences. Implications and future research are discussed.

T1  - The complex relationship between colorism and poor health outcomes with African Americans: A systematic review
AN  - 2472327744
AB  - Colorism has a deleterious effect on cognition and health impacting populations. Among African Americans, colorism and social stratification based on skin complexion, has profound sociological effects. These social relationships in daily living show the health burden associated with colorism is enormous. Dark‐skinned African Americans have lower socioeconomic status, diminished prestige, and are less likely to hold elected offices compared to their lighter skin counterparts. This systematic review critically examines a wider scope of effects colorism has on African American adults, a topic not well understood and underexplored. To what extent does colorism impact the psychosocial, educational, and economic outcomes of African Americans? What is the evidence for the efficacy of colorism research associated with poor health? PRISMA guidelines, which consisted of a 27‐item checklist and a four‐phase flow diagram, were used to evaluate research studies. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify and summarize qualitative and quantitative studies. The findings illustrate that African Americans with darker skin are significantly impacted by prejudice solely because of the color of their skin. The multidimensionality of colorism within society for African Americans delineates further damaging impacts on human health. Implications for social and policy changes are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice against members of a ridiculed working‐class group
AN  - 2448123252
AB  - In five experiments, we examined the stereotypes, emotions, and behavioural intentions associated with a Spanish working‐class group, known as chonis. We described a student (Experiments 1–3) or job candidate (Experiments 4–5) and presented participants with a picture showing a woman characterized either as choni or posh (an upper‐class group, Experiments 2–4) or with no picture (Experiments 1, 3–5). Depending on the condition, explicit information about her high social class (Experiment 1), performance (Experiment 3), or category (Experiment 5) was provided. Participants evaluated the candidate more negatively, felt less admiration, and were less willing to interact with her or to recommend her for a job when she was categorized as choni as compared to the other categories. These effects disappeared if the student/candidate had high socioeconomic status or performed excellently in the academic domain, but they were magnified for highly (vs. weakly) materialistic individuals. Class prejudice apparently has harmful effects on disadvantaged individuals, but can be mitigated by explicit information.

T1  - Mobility, familiarity and prejudice: living together in a multiethnic town in southern Laos
AN  - 2417139182
AB  - Research on coexistence and urban diversity (notably in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore) has demonstrated the ways individuals of diverse backgrounds routinely manage differences and interact meaningfully in multicultural societies, drawing on shared cultural knowledge and habits. This paper argues for a deeper exploration of societies where intercultural know-how is more limited and the capacity to negotiate difference has not been inculcated. This description fits several Southeast Asian societies wherein the politics of majority-minority is a dominant feature. This article investigates the possibilities of familiarity and friendship in a multiethnic town in southern Laos where the predominant ideology towards cultural diversity has been one of assimilation. In doing so, the paper reveals ways of creating a sense of belonging and community other than the practices of cultural accommodation. These processes draw on competences and dispositions which individuals have acquired through their mobility, producing a sense of togetherness, albeit contingent and fragmented.

T1  - Want to Improve Math Scores? An Empirical Assessment of Recent Policy Interventions in Canada
AN  - 2388009411
AB  - The Canadian provinces have implemented various strategies aimed at improving kindergarten through 12th-grade mathematics performance. There is no clear evidence which, if any, of these strategies improve achievement scores. We apply hierarchical linear modelling to the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment data to isolate the effects of policy interventions. We find that efforts to improve learning conditions can be worthwhile, but their effects are not as substantial as a school's socio-economic status composition, which elevates or depresses the academic achievements of all students. As barriers to school choice come down, ambitious parents will resort to active school choice, a strategy that may reduce social equity.Alternate abstract:Les provinces canadiennes ont instauré diverses stratégies visant à améliorer la performance en mathématiques des élèves de la maternelle à la 12e année. Rien ne démontre toutefois clairement lesquelles de ces stratégies, le cas échéant, augmentent bel et bien les taux de succès. Les auteurs appliquent la modélisation linéaire hiérarchique aux données de 2012 du Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des élèves, afin d'isoler l'incidence des interventions politiques. Ils constatent que les efforts visant l'amélioration des conditions d'apprentissage peuvent être utiles mais que leurs retombées ne sont pas aussi importantes que celles de la composition socio-économique de la clientèle scolaire, qui augmente ou diminue les résultats scolaires de tous les élèves. Avec la levée des obstacles au choix d'école, les parents ambitieux se prévaudront de ce choix, une stratégie qui pourrait être préjudiciable à l'équité sociale.

AB  - This research article critically analyses the photographs and illustrations that have been used to support arguments about Omar Khadr. Khadr was a 15-year-old who was captured by the US in Afghanistan, transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he was charged with murder and submitted to US interrogation. Throughout this process both supporters and opponents of Khadr have used pictures to support their claims. By examining and discussing these images it is possible to detect biases and prejudices that attempt to sway and influence the reader to the particular ideology of the writers. The article studies in depth images both for, and against, Khadr. It shows the different, printing and illustrating techniques that add menace to existing photographs, or soften the image for a more peaceful approach. In particular, it subjects the image of Khadr's damaged body being assisted by soldiers to a critical analysis to reveal what it really shows.

T1  - Structural racism as the fundamental cause of the academic achievement gap
AN  - 2235410844
AB  - Over six decades since the Supreme Court ruled that all American children have the right to a high quality education, the academic achievement gap remains an important social problem in the United States. Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: opposing constructions of mixed race in Australia
AN  - 2198982822
AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a 'situated politics of mixedness' is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations - the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in 'the big reveal' of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland 'white bread' Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how 'mixed race' is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences.

T1  - Factors Associated with North Korean Refugees’ Intention to Resettle Permanently in South Korea
AN  - 2153516019
AB  - Issues for North Korean refugee integration and resettlement have, in recent times, been a subject of great attention in South Korea. Previous studies documented that North Korean refugees faced significant obstacles in resettlement because of maladjustment and marginalisation, socioeconomic status differences between the North and the South, prejudice, suspicion, national identity, and strong nationalism. This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors that impede or facilitate the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea using a holistic approach (i.e. market and means, social connections, facilitators, and foundations). To this end, we analysed a sample of 405 North Korean refugees. Univariate comparison of descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were performed. Factors such as foundations (i.e. citizenship and other rights) were found to have strong positive associations with successful resettlement after controlling for sociodemographics and other characteristics. The study concludes that citizenship and rights need to be considered for the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea.

T1  - An Exploration of Femininity, Masculinity, and Racial Prejudices in <i>Herland</i>
AN  - 2136818807
AB  - Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935) helped spearhead the fin de siècle and early 20th‐century women’s rights movement and significantly contributed to the feminist literary genre with The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Despite her dedication to the women’s movement and contributions to feminist literature, her novel Herland (1915) features problematic undertones of racism, elitism, and masculine degradation. Within recent years, feminism has become a term that is synonymous with inclusivity, with a focus on intersectionality and the rights of not only women but others who have been disenfranchised by race, religious affiliation, sexuality, socioeconomic status, or gender identification. Given modern feminism’s focus on diversity, the racist undertones and focus on gender separatism in Herland places Gilman outside the feminist literary genre, particularly as it has been defined in recent decades.

T1  - 'They treat us like criminals': urban public spaces and ethnic discrimination in Italy
AN  - 2081349322
AB  - Mantovan's article analyses the processes that lead to discrimination against migrants in the public spaces of Italy's towns. Her analysis is based on a three-year research project conducted in northeastern Italy using mixed methods-ethnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, a press review, an analysis of relevant documentation and data collection-and remaining constantly in touch with research conducted in various Italian cities. Starting from an idea of a city whose evolution is the product of alliances, conflicts, active networks of individuals and their respective competing interests, Mantovan sheds light on how discrimination against immigrants in Italy's urban public spaces is the result of a process of social construction implemented by a number of social actors (journalists, citizens' committees, politicians and police forces) who represent the visible presence of migrants in these public spaces as deviant and unlawful, especially if they are undocumented immigrants and/or of low socio-economic status. She also argues for the importance of taking into consideration the contribution of economic and political dynamics, both global and national, to the generation of these phenomena by interacting with those at the local level.

T1  - Liberalism and the anxiety of belief
AN  - 2081347983
AB  - Anxiety about perceived threats to liberal freedom has played a double role in liberalism. On the one hand, such anxiety has driven the development of liberal institutions aimed at safeguarding freedoms. Yet another, problematic, side of this anxiety can also be found in the history of liberalism and in the policies and practices of contemporary liberal states. From the beginning, liberal intolerance of those perceived to be connected, through religious affiliation or beliefs, with arbitrary or absolute power and therefore deemed to pose a threat to the existing order has justified social exclusion and, in many cases, systematic violence. Rae's article examines the theoretical and political roots of this distinctive form of liberal anxiety, tracing the connection between anxiety about Catholicism and Catholics in John Locke's time and contemporary anxieties about the relationship between Islamism and Muslims in liberal states.

T1  - Does Asserting a Nonblack Identity Elicit Positive Evaluations? White Observers' Reactions to Black, Biracial, Multiracial, and White Job Applicants
AN  - 1986849627
AB  - How do white observers react when people with black heritage assert a biracial, multiracial, or white identity rather than a black identity? To address this question, I conducted two experiments in which participants evaluated a darker-skinned or a lighter-skinned job applicant who presented his identity as either black, biracial, multiracial, or white. The results show that identity assertions influenced how white observers categorized applicants but not how they evaluated applicants. Most white observers accepted the identity of both the lighter-skinned and darker-skinned applicant when they asserted that they were black, biracial, or multiracial, but observers did not accept the identity of the darker-skinned applicant who asserted a white identity. However, white observers did not perceive applicants who asserted that they were multiracial, biracial, or white as more hirable than applicants who asserted that they were black. Based on these results, I argue that racial identity assertions do not independently provide a pathway to racialized advantages.

T1  - Killing Fields: Explaining Police Violence against Persons of Color
AN  - 1972240546
AB  - This concluding article situates the police violence against persons of color in an historical context, suggesting that the current wave of killings replicates historical trends. A social science explanation is proposed to better understand the antecedents and consequences of police violence. A major strength of the articles in this volume is their delineation of causes of police violence and their consequences. The underlying and recurring explanation for police violence is stereotypical racial attitudes and their behavioral consequences. Effects of police violence extend beyond immediate victims to include communities of color. Comparisons with European police suggest that while lethal actions by police in Europe are far fewer, patterns of brutality and its justification mirror the U.S. context. The problem of police violence against persons of color is multidimensional and complex. This article concludes that there is no easy overarching solution or "fix" to this violence. Rather, each facet must be carefully examined--as this volume has done--and approaches focused on causes and consequences of specific problems should be developed and pursued.

T1  - "Not helping out": classed strategies of the (non) contribution of children in immigrant family businesses
AN  - 1913883009
AB  - This article analyses the role of immigrant entrepreneurs' class positions in understanding the participation of children in business activities. Immigrant entrepreneurship scholarship has highlighted how the participation of children depends on relations of reciprocity as well as on the lack of opportunities in paid employment. I argue that the (non) contribution of children has to do with the social mobility strategies that migrant families put in place. Drawing on the narratives of fifty-five Latin American entrepreneurs and family members in Spain, I explain (i) the role of the small firm in trajectories of social mobility, (ii) how class positions explain the (non) participation of children, and (iii) the mechanisms by which downward mobility is cushioned through practices of distinction for middle-class entrepreneurs. The article contributes to nuance our understanding of the role of family ties in migrant firms by integrating the impact of class on the lives of migrants' children.

T1  - African American Personal Presentation
AN  - 1830031114
AB  - A great amount of literature is dedicated to racial identity and self-perception, but very little addresses how hair may play a critical role in how African American women view themselves and others. African American women choose to wear their hair in a variety of styles, including weaves, wigs, dreads, chemically processed, or non-chemically processed (often referred to as "natural hair"). Researchers conducted a study that explored 282 African American females from urban and rural communities, varying in age, socio-economic status, and education levels and discussed the reporting of the hairstyles they currently wear, what styles they believe are more attractive/unattractive, what styles they believe are more professional/unprofessional, and what influenced the style they currently wear. In addition, these women completed the Rotter's Locus of Control and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scales. Regression analyses indicated there was a slight but significant positive correlation between a higher internal locus of control and those who choose to wear their hair in a natural state; however, the regression showed no statistically significant predictive value for hair selection. A discussion of the psychological implications for the findings, thoughts of self-perception, and how these findings can be used for future practice is addressed.

T1  - From apathy to obsession: the reactions of A. K. Chesterton and the British far right to imperial decline
AN  - 1835698144
AB  - Mulhall sets out to explain how, contrary to what one might expect, imperial decline was rarely a pressing issue for the British far right, usually falling below both the perceived threats of Communism and immigration on their list of priorities. By first explaining these unexpected findings and then placing them in an international comparative context, new evidence emerges that supports those imperial historians who subscribe to the 'minimal impact' orthodoxy regarding the effect of empire on the metropole. In addition, however, those aspects of the radical right that did concern themselves with imperial decline, namely A. K. Chesterton and the League of Empire Loyalists, are explored in depth, revealing a peculiarly British form of conspiratorial antisemitism that blamed imperial decline on secret Jewish power. This strand of conspiracy thinking, best articulated by Chesterton, is traced back to its origin so as to illuminate the continuity of ideas and ideologies between the interwar and post-war periods within the British far right. The result is an article that contributes to several existing historiographical debates and provides an exploration of a less well-known aspect of the work of A. K. Chesterton and conspiratorial antisemitism more generally.

T1  - Gradients in Depressive Symptoms by Socioeconomic Position Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in the EXPLORE Study
AN  - 1807594868
AB  - This study examines gradients in depressive symptoms by socioeconomic position (SEP; i.e., income, education, employment) in a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM). Data were used from EXPLORE, a randomized, controlled behavioral HIV prevention trial for HIV-uninfected MSM in six U.S. cities (n = 4,277). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (short form). Multiple linear regressions were fitted with interaction terms to assess additive and multiplicative relationships between SEP and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent among MSM with lower income, lower educational attainment, and those in the unemployed/other employment category. Income, education, and employment made significant contributions in additive models after adjustment. The employment-income interaction was statistically significant, indicating a multiplicative effect. This study revealed gradients in depressive symptoms across SEP of MSM, pointing to income and employment status and, to a lesser extent, education as key factors for understanding heterogeneity of depressive symptoms.

T1  - Why do Asian Americans academically outperform Whites? - The cultural explanation revisited
AN  - 1793587480
AB  - We advocate an interactive approach to examining the role of culture and SES in explaining Asian Americans' achievement. We use Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) 2002 baseline data to test our proposition that the cultural orientation of Asian American families is different from that of white American families in ways that mediate the effects of family SES on children's academic achievement. The results support our hypothesis, indicating that: (1) SES's positive effects on achievement are stronger among white students than among Asian-Americans; (2) the association between a family's SES and behaviors and attitudes is weaker among Asian-Americans than among Whites; (3) a fraction of the Asian-White achievement gap can be accounted for by ethnic differences in behaviors and attitudes, particularly ethnic differences in family SES's effects on behaviors and attitudes. We find that Asian Americans' behaviors and attitudes are less influenced by family SES than those of Whites are and that this difference helps generate Asians' premium in achievement. This is especially evident at lower levels of family SES. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15300570]

T1  - A Religious Worldview: Protecting One's Meaning System Through Religious Prejudice
AN  - 1725035927
AB  - For some people, religion strongly influences their worldviews. We propose that religious outgroups threaten the foundational beliefs of people with strong religious worldviews (RWVs) by endorsing alternative belief systems and that this threat contributes to religious prejudice. To examine these ideas, we developed a measure of RWV strength and assessed the role of RWV threat in religious prejudice. Across five studies, strength of RWV was related to religious prejudice, including derogation and denial of alternative religious viewpoints, as well as support for suppressing, avoiding, and even aggressing against religious outgroups. These responses were strongest toward religious outgroups whose worldviews were the most different, and therefore most threatening. Mediational analyses revealed that strong RWV people expressed heightened prejudice because of the worldview threat posed by religious outgroup members. These findings indicate that the avoidance and subjugation of religious outgroups can serve as a worldview protection strategy for some people.

T1  - Social Policy and Perceived Immigrant Labor Market Competition in Europe: Is Prevention Better Than Cure?
AN  - 1718065539; 201530983
AB  - Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Expanding the African-American Studies Paradigm to Include Health: a Novel Approach to Promoting Health Equity
AN  - 1929900433
AB  - Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health [care] is the most shocking and inhumane. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King’s declaration in 1966 speaks to the unrealized ideal of equal and appropriate attention to health as a human right and is echoed by the World Health Organization, which describes “the highest attainable standard of health”as a “fundamental right of every human being” (WHO 2012). Proponents of social justice share this view and understand the paradigmatic shift in thought and deed necessary to bring this view to reality (Marmot and Bell 2009; Hofrichter 2003). Inherent in the perspective of holding health as a human right is the notion of the “universal cultural value” of health as an indicator of the well-being of a community and the status of its members (Pinkney 2000, p.131). When health is robust, communities flourish. When health is compromised, communities are weakened. For marginalized individuals and communities,the notion of health is a ubiquitous yet often suppressed concern, until it becomes too great to ignore. Even then, without appropriate resources and support, it can be difficult to significantly reverse the course of poor health outcomes. African Americans bear a greater burden of death and disease compared to Whites. This speaks to the reduced vitality of African-American communities and underscores a history of marginalized citizenship. Further, those with lower socioeconomic statuses (SES) do not fare nearly as well on indices of health as those with higher SES (Banks et al. 2006). The complex mix of race and class has had severe consequences on the health of African Americans, resulting in disparities in health and health care that for many constitute a public health crisis (Satcher Health Leadership Institute, n.d.). Addressing these disparities requires innovative, multi-pronged approaches. One such approach involves a targeted expansion of the African-American studies paradigm to include health.The purpose of this discussion is to offer justification for expanding the African-American studies paradigm using a public health-oriented approach, specifically grounded in health education and promotion, to examine health disparities as a point of emphasis with a focus on social determinants of health.This discussion also offers practical recommendations for incorporating health in Black studies and presents dual models of inclusion.

T1  - Inequality Preservation through Uneven Diffusion of Cultural Materials across Stratified Groups
AN  - 1700673149; 201525212
AB  - Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other -- an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance.

T1  - The socio-economic well-being of internal migrants in Agbogbloshie, Ghana
AN  - 1788298813
AB  - The recent claims that migration can improve the well-being of migrants and their dependants back home has mainly focused on international migration to destinations that are considered developed. Few studies have focused on internal migration and its effects on migrants' wellbeing. Besides, whether migrations to areas that are considered not developed can also contribute to improving the well-being of migrants and their dependants back home remains unaccounted for in the literature. This study employed a quantitative design involving descriptive statistics, independent t- test and binomial test to examine the effects of internal migration on the wellbeing of migrants in Agbogbloshie-the most populous slum in Accra. The study found that the determinants of well-being; income, education and employment have improved for migrants after migration. The results implied that migration had a net positive effect on migrants' wellbeing. However, this benefit comes at a cost as migrant workers are engaged in works that post a lot of risk such as carrying very heavy loads, exposed to toxic substances and living in very poor accommodation. The paper recommends that efforts be made by governments to bridge the development gap between the north and south of the country so as to limit the rate of migration.

T1  - Phenotyping and Adolescence-to-Adulthood Transitions Among Latinos
AN  - 1616082366
AB  - Phenotyping the system of prejudice and discrimination, which gives preference to European physical characteristics and devalues those of Amerindians, Africans, and Asians, affects the lives of many Latinos in the US. This study examines the impact of phenotyping on academic and employment outcomes among Latino adolescents/young adults. Outcomes examined include the odds of graduating from high school, finding full-time employment after completing high school, and attending college. Socioeconomic status (measured at individual and school levels), family structure, quality of parent-child relationships, immigrant generational status, and other measures are included as controls. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression are utilized as analytical tools. Results indicate that, among Latinos, light skin and blue eyes are associated with better academic outcomes than having dark skin and brown eyes, while those with darker skin enter the labor market earlier than their light-skinned co-ethnics.

T1  - The 'Immigrant Paradox' Phenomenon: Assessing Problem Behaviors and Risk Factors Among Immigrant and Native Adolescents
AN  - 1680154443; 201513914
AB  - We investigated the 'immigrant paradox' phenomenon by examining differences in problem behavior engagement and exposure to risk factors across four adolescent groups: 1,157 first-generation, 1,498 second-generation, and 3,316 White and minority third or higher generations. Latent mean differences in problem behavior engagement (i.e., academic failure, aggression, and substance use) and risk factors (i.e., low socioeconomic status, poor family relationship, and low sense of school belonging) were associated with significant differences across adolescent groups. Results supported the generational status effect by demonstrating sequentially greater adolescent problem behavior engagement. However, the difference in exposure to risk factors across adolescent groups only partially supported the immigrant paradox. Further, the multiple group analysis of the relationships between risk factors and engagement in problem behaviors showed increased susceptibility among second generation immigrants for substance use, White natives for academic failure and substance use, and minority natives for physical aggression. Study findings have implications for understanding how the immigrant paradox leads to different adjustment patterns and problem behavior manifestations among immigrant and native adolescents.

T1  - What Makes Muslims Feel French?
AN  - 1660021864; 201505717
AB  - In this article, we analyze the extent to which Muslims self-identify as French. A common interpretation of Muslim political attitudes assumes that Islam fundamentally conflicts with mainstream European society and that when Muslims are more attached to their religion they will be less likely to identify as French. We examine this assumption by exploring whether Muslim national identification is more strongly related to religiosity or other factors such as socio-economic status, social networks, and immigrant integration. Our results offer some support for each explanation, but we find that religiosity is not the dominant force shaping Muslims' attitudes. Instead, factors associated with immigrant integration have the most profound relationship with Muslim identification. These conclusions are supported by the fact that religiosity and immigrant integration variables have similar effects on the national identification of Christian immigrants. Our findings suggest that focusing on religiosity is not the best way to analyze Muslims' attitudes or identities, and that tensions surrounding Muslims' self-identification with France are likely to decrease in future generations, as immigrant integration proceeds through the increased prevalence of birth in France, having French citizenship, and French language fluency.

T1  - Determinants of Perceived Skin-Color Discrimination in Latin America
AN  - 1700673973; 201525164
AB  - Discrimination on the basis of skin color persists as a serious social and political problem in many of the world's nations. Although numerous consequences of such discrimination have been enumerated, considerably less is known regarding the bases of perceived discrimination. In this study, individuals' perceptions that they have been the targets of skin-color discrimination are examined. Using 2010 America's Barometer data from six nations, a multifaceted account of the possible bases of perceived discrimination is devised and tested. Three classes of predictors are considered: (1) variables related to a person's skin color, race, and ethnicity; (2) extraneous demographic and psychological factors; and (3) aspects of the individual's regional social and political context. Results reveal that both skin color and racial and ethnic self-categorization strongly correspond with perceived discrimination, with additional, more modest, effects identified for socioeconomic status (wealth), personality (agreeableness), and the composition of a person's regional context.

T1  - Association Between Childhood School Segregation and Changes in Adult Sense of Control in the African American Health Cohort
AN  - 1650145660; 201502435
AB  - Objective. Cross-sectional associations between childhood school segregation and adult sense of control and physical performance have been established in the African American Health (AAH) cohort. Here we extend that work by estimating the association between childhood school segregation and 2-year changes in adult sense of control. Method. Complete data on 541 older AAH men and women were used to estimate the association between childhood school segregation and changes in the sense of control. Exposure to segregation was self-reported in 2004, and the sense of control was measured in 2008 and 2010 using Blom rank transformations of Mirowsky and Ross' 8-item scale. Declining subjective income and experiencing major life stressors between 2008 and 2010, as well as traditional covariates (demographic factors, socioeconomic status, self-rated health, racial attitudes and beliefs, and religiosity) were included for statistical adjustment. Multiple linear regression analysis with propensity score reweighting was used. Results. Receiving the majority of one's primary and secondary education in segregated schools had a significant net positive association (d = 0.179; p = .029) with 2-year changes in adult sense of control. Conclusion. AAH participants receiving the majority of their primary and secondary educations in segregated schools appeared to have been protected, in part, from age-related declines in the sense of control.

T1  - Routing Black Migration to the Urban US South: Social Class and Sources of Social Capital in the Destination Selection Process
AN  - 1512220470; 201408869
AB  - This article examines sources of migrant social capital (i.e. social networks and institutional assistance) that facilitated destination selection among African American migrants to a US southern metropolitan area-Charlotte, North Carolina. Charlotte is an emerging magnet city in the net in-migration of blacks to the US South since the 1970s. While research on black migration to the South suggests that family ties assist migrants in selecting destinations, scholars speculate that family ties are less important for migrants of high socio-economic status, who are born outside the South or who move to urban areas. Using qualitative narrative interviews with non-southern-born black migrants to Charlotte, this study identifies other sources of assistance that route blacks to their destination-employers, educational institutions (especially historically black colleges) and the ethnic media. Working-class migrants relied primarily on family and friends when selecting their destination, but middle-class migrants relied on a broader range of sources. Implications for theory about how class shapes the destination selection process are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Snakes and Ladders in Educational Systems: Access to Higher Education for Second-Generation Turks in Europe
AN  - 1512218884; 201408779
AB  - Based on the first international standardised survey on the second generation in Europe, I compare the school trajectories of youth from the same origin group (parents born in Turkey), with the same starting position (born in Europe) and the same socio-economic status (parents with only modest educational credentials) in six European countries. The differences between countries are substantial. The opportunity to enter higher education is seven times greater in the highest-performing country than in the lowest. These differences can be explained by the institutional arrangements in education in interaction with the available family resources. The article highlights the importance of the oft-neglected national school context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An Argument for Separate Analyses of Attitudes Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Men, Bisexual Women, MtF and FtM Transgender Individuals
AN  - 1357006002
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              While past research has certainly investigated a variety of correlates of U.S. attitudes toward lesbians, gays, bisexual men, bisexual women, male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transgender (LGBT) individuals, there are no U.S. quantitative studies that could be located that examined attitudes toward each of these groups separately. This is especially important because efforts to combat prejudices are likely to be most successful if they are based in research that explores how attitudes are both similar and different across specified targets of prejudice. Toward that goal, this essay underscores the significance of examining U.S. attitudes toward LGBT individuals as separate constructs. Both the gender and sexual orientation of the target of prejudice and the gender and sexual orientation of the respondent are highlighted as important constructs that should be considered when investigating U.S. attitudes toward LGBT individuals. First, I review previous U.S. studies that have examined attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Second, I offer arguments for how the intersections of gender and sexual orientation may affect attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Third, I discuss future considerations in studies of attitudes toward LGBT individuals in the context of multiple intersectionalities. I suggest that U.S. initiatives to reduce sexual stigma, gender nonconformity stigma, and transgender stigma should be grounded in research that highlights prejudicial attitudes as they vary by the target of prejudice and the respondents' characteristics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Latino Racial Reporting in the US: To Be or Not To Be
AN  - 1429623870; 201335828
AB  - This review focuses on how Latinos report their race. This is an area that has recently experienced a major surge of interest in both government and academic circles. This review of the literature examines how and why Latinos report their race on the census, in surveys and in more qualitative studies. It reviews the vibrant and growing scholarly literature relevant to the questions of the placement -- by self or others -- of Latinos along the US color line, what determines it and how the Census has coped and is coping with it. We begin with a brief review of the history of Latino classification in the census and then discuss the factors influencing racial reporting. These include national origin and skin color, acculturation and generational status, socioeconomic status, perceived discrimination and identification with others who have experienced actual discrimination, location, and question format. We end with a discussion of the implications of the recent 2010 Alternative Questionnaire Experiment conducted by the census, and conclude with suggestions for future research.

T1  - Intersectional understandings of disability and implications for a social justice reform agenda in education policy and practice
AN  - 1417526696; 201331981
AB  - This article explores the multiple and shifting ways in which disability intersects with other sources of social disadvantage. Disablism forms part of an intricate web of social conditions that subjugate certain forms of 'student-subjects' and create compounding forms of oppression and exclusion that need to be addressed through relevant education policy and practice. Intersectional understandings of disability expose the multiple dynamics that impact upon constructing disabled students' identities. These identities should not be regarded as fixed and transcendental entities gauged against varied bodily, mental and psychological differences, but should be understood in conjunction with the ways in which race, gender and socio-economic status intersect with the experience of disability. Intersectional understandings of disability, drawn from intersectional feminism and disability studies, destabilize reductionist accounts of individual pathology and privilege new forms of pedagogical thinking and acting that prioritize a social justice framework in tackling wider systemic rigidities and oppressive educational regimes.

T1  - Why are teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education socially biased? A mixed-methods research
AN  - 1551002755; 201430206
AB  - The consequences of educational differentiation have been at the centre of research in sociology of education during the past decades. Processes of educational allocation have, however, received much less attention. Despite the fact that research has shown that teacher recommendations in France and Germany are partly determined by pupils' social background, studies that inquire into the causes of this social bias seem to be virtually inexistent. This study aims to examine whether teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) are also socially biased, and if so what causes these differentials in advice, using a mixed-methods design. We found the advice given by primary school teachers to be partly determined by pupils' social background. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that teachers tend to evaluate pupils from low socio-economic status backgrounds less positively, due to their emphasis on specific pupil characteristics.

T1  - Social Class Identification Among Black Americans: Trends and Determinants, 1974-2010
AN  - 1266146569; 201300385
AB  - Although much research documents the growth of a "professional middle class" among African Americans over the past several decades, we know comparatively little about how Blacks see themselves in social class terms, and whether this has changed over time. In the current study, we use data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Surveys to analyze trends in, and the determinants of, Blacks' social class identifications (SCI) over the past four decades. Our results show that Blacks' tendency to identify as "middle class" has increased in concert with Blacks' socioeconomic status (SES) gains since the 1970s. Regarding the determinants of SCI, education and household income appear more consequential than occupational prestige and self-employment in shaping Blacks' self-reports of their own class positions. Finally, we see little evidence of change over time in the relationship between various SES characteristics and SCI, with one exception: Self-employment has become a more potent predictor of Blacks' SCI over the past several decades. Our results provide an important update to our knowledge of the dynamics of SCI among Black Americans. They also raise important questions for future research on the relationship between, and relative impact of, "race" and "class" in shaping Blacks' identities and their orientations toward American society.

T1  - Poverty and Health: The Mediating Role of Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 1322726308; 201314094
AB  - Social-class discrimination is evident in many societies around the world, but little is known about its impact on the poor or its role as an explanatory variable in the link between socioeconomic status and health. The current study tested the extent to which perceived discrimination explains socioeconomic gradients in physical health. Participants were 252 adolescents (51% male, 49% female; mean age = 17.51 years, SD = 1.03 years) who participated in Wave 3 of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the developmental consequences of rural poverty. Physical health was operationalized as allostatic load, a measure of cumulative wear and tear on the body caused by overactivation of physiological systems that respond to stress. Mediation analyses suggested that 13% of the effect of poverty on allostatic load is explained by perceived discrimination. The findings suggest that social-class discrimination is one important mechanism behind the influence of poverty on physical health. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Civilizing vs destructive globalization? A multi-level analysis of anti-immigrant prejudice
AN  - 1125218007; 201240235
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the latest wave of globalization on anti-immigrant prejudice. We discern and test two contradictory accounts of the impact of globalization on anti-immigrant prejudice from the prejudice and globalization literatures. On the one hand, there is the 'civilizing/integrative globalization' thesis, which implies that globalization should help to decrease prejudice by creating sustained and equal contact between previously alien cultures and peoples, and by spreading economic gains to everybody. On the other hand, there is the 'destructive globalization/globalization as a threat' thesis, which argues that globalization should increase anti-immigrant prejudice by intensifying competition over resources and by increasing perceived threat by native populations as a result of increasing immigrant populations. We test these two accounts using a multi-level analysis of 64 countries and nearly 150,000 individuals, derived from the World Values Surveys (waves 3-5). Our analyses reveal support for 'destructive globalization/globalization as a threat' thesis, but emphasize the multi-dimensional character of globalization. We find that citizens of countries with higher levels of trade openness have significantly more anti-immigrant sentiments. There is also some evidence that in countries where unemployment is accompanied by high levels of trade openness or the existence of large immigrant populations, citizens hold high anti-immigrant prejudice. By contrast, foreign direct investment (FDI) has a weak effect. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Understanding Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey: socio-economy, religion, and politics
AN  - 919903734; 201201634
AB  - In his recent article in Ethnic and Racial Studies, entitled 'Curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey', (Sarigil 2010) tests two rival hypotheses regarding Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey and, using data from the World Values Survey (WVS), finds that socio-economic status (levels of income and education) better explains the individual roots of Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey than does religiousness. In this paper, I offer both a methodological critique of Sarigil's research and a replication of his model with a more appropriate sample. I first argue that Sarigil's research design lacks internal validity because it studies Kurdish nationalism within a sample that predominantly consists of Turks, which invalidates his findings. I then replicate and expand Sarigil's model within a specific sample of Kurdish-speaking people in Turkey. The results show dramatic changes. Religiosity and political satisfaction seem to be better predictors of support for Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey than do socio-economic factors. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1520341425; 201413266
AB  - Ashkenazi (European) Jews have high average earnings, educational attainment, socio-economic status, and intellectual achievements. It is proposed that these can be at least partially explained by their high average IQ, which is estimated at 110. The Mizrahim (Oriental) and the Ethiopian Jews have lower IQs, estimated 91 for the Mizrahim and 70 for the Ethiopian Jews. There have been three principal explanations offered for the high average IQ of the Ashkenazi Jews. These are the Eugenic, the Persecution, and the Discrimination hypotheses. All provide plausible explanations and it may well be that all three of the factors they point to have contributed to this remarkable phenomenon. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Migration, Social Exclusion and Identity Issues of Macedonian Roma
AN  - 1037878585; 201231229
AB  - The key aspects of issues related to Roma identity are inevitably linked to traditional migration on one hand and the long-term exposure of Roma to discrimination and social exclusion on the other. Therefore, the debate about identity issues, which are also disputable within the framework of the Roma community, would not be feasible without a brief review of the historical patterns of the movement of the Roma, processes of change during the migration waves and preservation of awareness of belonging to a group with specific ethnic and cultural features. The contemporary analysis of the identity issues of Roma in Macedonia has an ambitious goal: through the application of three approaches used in the research of Roma, to give an overview of the causes and effects of the socio-economic status of Roma, migration and issues related to identity.

T1  - The Impact of Immigrant Concentration in Spanish Schools: School, Class, and Composition Effects
AN  - 1018368573; 201212833
AB  - The existence of a negative correlation between the concentration of immigrants in certain schools and the school attainment of its students is a well-documented empirical conclusion in the American and European sociology of education, yet sociologists of education are still debating why the migrant (and ethnic) composition of schools has such an impact on results above and beyond individual characteristics. Using a Spanish survey study (INECSE, Evaluacion de la Educacion Primaria 2003, Madrid, 2005), this article intends to confirm and measure the poorer results of students in schools where immigrants are more highly represented. It also seeks to identify potential explanations to account for variation in attainment due to the concentration of immigrant origin students in some schools. In the literature, the empirical analyses that seek to explain this empirical regularity are far less frequent, despite the fact that the list of its potential causes includes several mediating mechanisms. We deal with three main groups of causes that could be responsible for this regularity: (i) micro-interactions or peer group effects; (ii) compositional effects-the pupil population is not randomly distributed on the school map but according to important features that determine their future school attainment (such as socio-economic status); and (iii) school/classroom effects-given their contextual characteristics, the quantity and quality of their human and material resources, some schools offer a less stimulating learning environment.

T1  - Did Segregation Increase as the City Expanded? The Case of Montreal, 1881-1901
AN  - 1018352070; 201213678
AB  - Montreal in 1881 was highly segregated along four distinct social dimensions: language, religion, socioeconomic status, and sector of employment. By 1901 the population had doubled, and we examine changes in residential distributions over the two decades. Despite the increased integration of certain groups, segregation remains high, and multiple dimensions are still discernible. In addition to long-established communities of French Canadians, Irish Catholics, and Anglo-Protestants, we see new streams of immigrants occupying their own patches in the urban fabric. To make meaningful observations of sociospatial changes over two decades, we used a geographic information system (GIS) to situate individual census households with spatial precision on 1 of 12,000 lots in 1881 and 30,000 in 1901, so that we could reaggregate them into meaningful districts of different scales and districts with identical boundaries for both years of observation, thereby overcoming the major methodological problems hindering previous comparative analyses. Coupling well-established statistical indexes of segregation and diversity in a GIS framework lends new analytic power to grasp the scale of phenomena and inquire into behavioral choices of nineteenth-century households. The empirical evidence shows how both concentration and diversity were built into the urban fabric. This study also offers methodological cues for comparative studies in other places and periods.

T1  - Curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey: an empirical assessment of pro-Islamic and socio-economic approaches
AN  - 743047745; 201031798
AB  - Within the debates on curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey, the pro-Islamic approach puts emphasis on empowering the notion of 'Islamic brotherhood' between Turks and Kurds. The socio-economic approach, on the other hand, draws attention to improving the socio-economic status of the Kurds. By using World Values Survey data, this study tests these two distinct approaches. Logit estimates provide strong support for the socio-economic approach. Individuals with a better socio-economic status (i.e. higher level of education and income) are less likely to support Kurdish ethno-nationalist formations while religion-related factors do not have a significant impact. Some theoretical and policy implications are also provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Acculturative and neighborhood influences on subjective social status among Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers
AN  - 60355317; 201017626
AB  - Subjective social status (SSS) reflects an individual's perception of her/his relative position in the social hierarchy. However, little is known about culturally-relevant, multilevel predictors of low de la among low socioeconomic status (SES), minority populations. The goal of this study was to identify individual- and neighborhood-level variables predicting de la among 297 Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers living in several locations in Texas, with an emphasis on the association of de la with acculturative and socioeconomic variables. Participants were recruited and enrolled through the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service from August 2002 to March 2004. Determinants of de la were explored using a series of linear regressions. In analyses adjusting for demographics (including objective indicators of SES), speaking Spanish at home and work and living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, respectively, were associated with low de la . However, in analyses including demographics, acculturation, and neighborhood characteristics, only income, education, and acculturation remained associated with de la . Consistent with results from a previous study in the area (Franzini & Fernandez-Esquer, 2006), less acculturation predicted low de la among immigrant Latino smokers. However, unlike previous research, these associations were maintained after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the density of less acculturated Latinos within economically deprived neighborhoods might account for the disappearance of neighborhood effects in the final model.
