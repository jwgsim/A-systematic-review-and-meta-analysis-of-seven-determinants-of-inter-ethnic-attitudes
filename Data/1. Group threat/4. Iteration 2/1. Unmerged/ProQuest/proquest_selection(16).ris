T1  - We will rescue Italy, but we dislike the European Union: Collective narcissism and the COVID-19 threat: GPIR
AN  - 2669413223
AB  - Collective narcissists are hostile towards outgroup members, especially in response to threats against the ingroup. In the current study (N = 662; Polish community sample), we examined the associations between collective narcissism and intergroup relations using the agency–communion model of collective narcissism during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 threat in Poland. Assuming the COVID-19 threat is agentic (i.e., related to biological and economic danger), we expected it to be unrelated to collective narcissism’s communal aspect. We also expected that collective narcissists would enhance their ingroup image to modify the effects of the COVID-19 threat on intergroup relations. In general, collective narcissism was related to less favorable attitudes toward the European Union, more favorable attitudes toward China, and a willingness to help Italians. The agentic aspect of narcissism was unrelated to intergroup prosocialness, while the communal aspect of narcissism was unrelated to attitudes toward the European Union. The COVID threat suppressed unfavorable attitudes towards the European Union among collective narcissists. Therefore, the COVID threat has limited yet unexpected effects on attitudes toward outgroups among collective narcissists.

T1  - Immigration and the sociocultural divide in Central and Eastern Europe: Stasis or evolution?
AN  - 2647921729
AB  - Immigration has historically been of low salience in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East's limited politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of emigration and the presence of ethnic minority ‘others’. I argue that this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly related to anti‐immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are polarizing across the GAL‐TAN dimension and by education. Hence, immigration is bolstering a pre‐existing, socially structured divide around both nationalist and traditionalist values.

T1  - Exploring LGBT+ campus climate in the UK and Philippines: How prejudice and belonging shape inclusion in higher education
AN  - 2675939324
AB  - Although recent global developments suggest progress toward LGBT+ equality, institutional structures perpetuating differential treatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist. The present research employed a mixed‐method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis‐heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large‐scale survey assessing relationships among students’ social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well‐being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis‐heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates. Fostering belonging, through visible institutional support for intersectional LGBT+ student organisations and endorsement of LGBT+ inclusive policies and programmes, is recommended for creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBT+ students.

T1  - A four-dimensional model of Asian American stereotypes: GPIR
AN  - 2609041705
AB  - The content of the Asian American model minority stereotype is important for understanding how Asian American individuals are perceived. Existing theories about stereotype content may not capture the unique historical and cultural context that could affect perceptions of Asian American individuals. We have identified a more differentiated underlying structure with four dimensions—warmth, competence, self-centeredness, and submissiveness—that differ in their rated typicality and desirability for Asian and White Americans. We then developed the 16-item Asian American Stereotypes Scale to measure perceptions of Asian Americans on these four dimensions. Ratings on the different dimensions predict unique variance in attitudes toward Asian Americans and other minority groups, contact with Asians or Asian Americans, perceptions of size of the Asian American population, and system justification. The four-dimensional model and the Asian American Stereotypes Scale allow us to predict and examine the unique impacts of Asian American stereotypes in a way that differs from more general models.

T1  - The Different Faces of Social Tolerance: Conceptualizing and Measuring Respect and Coexistence Tolerance
AN  - 2594368934
AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies.

T1  - The multifaceted relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration in contemporary Italy
AN  - 2579221342
AB  - When analyzing the relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration, empirical research often leads to contrasting findings. By focusing on contemporary Italy, our contribution aims to provide evidence of two opposite effects that religiosity can exert on attitudes toward immigration. On the one hand, belonging to a religious community is expected to reinforce a social identity, leading to negative attitudes toward outgroups. On the other hand, religious commitment implies adhering to religious teachings which promote altruistic values, such as the acceptance of others. Since the two hypotheses pertain to different dimensions of religiosity, we propose to use a typology combining affiliation and church attendance, so that the two hypotheses can be tested as complementary. The first evidence we provide to support the hypotheses analyzes parallel survey data coming from the European Social Survey (ESS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). In particular, we point out that non-religious and highly religious people show more positive attitudes toward immigration than affiliated individuals with low religious commitment. Moreover, data from the 2018 ISSP module “Religion IV”, which includes more specific measures of religious identity and commitment, lend further support to our expectations.

T1  - Representation and resistance: A qualitative study of narratives of Deaf cultural identity
AN  - 2565791747
AB  - This qualitative study examines narratives of identity among deaf adults in Denmark who were raised within the Bilingual–Bicultural programme of education. At a time of threat to sign language and the Deaf community, the study explores the distinctiveness of a minority cultural identity rooted in sign language and elaborated through Deaf norms and values. Applying the social psychological theories of social identity and social representations, the analysis shows that while Deaf identity is developed through and against forces of marginalisation and the medicalising system of representation that cochlear implants reify, it both celebrates Deaf culture and embraces cross-cultural dialogue and exchange. The findings run against existing models of deaf identity that posit discrete Deaf (immersive) and bicultural identities. They also disclose the importance of studies of social identity that retrieve the theory’s original emphasis on cultural systems and context to explain identities and intergroup dynamics. Finally, the study has resonances for disability and other minority studies and movements that seek to pay attention to socially creative processes of critiquing normativity and enlarging understandings of culture and identity.

T1  - Seeing and treating the out-group like family: Transference effects in an ethnic context: GPIR
AN  - 2513520124
AB  - Transference effects occur when our impressions are guided by our mental representations of significant others. For instance, if a target resembles an individual’s significant other, then that person’s feelings toward their significant other will be transferred onto the target. The present research examines whether transference effects emerge even when the target belongs to an ethnic out-group. In two experiments, participants received descriptions of in-group and out-group targets who partly resembled their own (or another’s) positive significant other. The findings showed that resemblance to one’s own significant other improves attitudes and behavior toward both in-group and ethnic out-group targets, as found across 2 nations and 3 different ethnic out-groups. The present research hence provides evidence of robust transference effects across ethnic group boundaries.

T1  - Virtual Reality and Political Outgroup Contact: Can Avatar Customization and Common Ingroup Identity Reduce Social Distance?
AN  - 2507921931
AB  - This study (N = 217) explores the potential for virtual reality to decrease social distance toward outgroup members among women. Raising the salience of individuals’ real physical identity through avatar customization and common ingroup identity manipulations was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations.

T1  - They’re all out to get me! Assessing inter-group competition among multiple populations
AN  - 2571103154
AB  - With the changing demography of the United States, there has been a significant growth in the literature focused on inter-group attitudes. While this has advanced our understanding of how pervasive negative inter-group attitudes are among racial and ethnic populations, little work has been able to explore these attitudes across multiple populations. This is a significant drawback, as it prevents the ability to establish any frame of reference when examining any specific relationship among populations under study. Drawing on the 2008 Collaborative Multiracial Political Study (CMPS), we examine perceptions of both intra- and inter-group competition among Latinos, Blacks, Asian Americans, and Whites. Our research design makes four important contributions to the literature: (1) we examine the correlation between perceptions of competition across multiple racial groups simultaneously; (2) we include a measure of internal-competition to test whether perceptions of competition with one’s own group lead to higher levels of perceived competition with outside groups; (3) we test the relative impact of real and perceived neighborhood diversity on perceptions of competition; and finally, (4) we examine the relationship between perceived competition and other racial attitudes to gain a better understanding of whether perceptions of competition should be interpreted as evidence of inter-group tension or conflict.

T1  - Love knows no colour bar: Windrush, racism and <i>Flame in the Streets</i>
AN  - 2428991997
AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

T1  - Attitudes toward abortion, social welfare programs, and gender roles in the U.S. and South Africa
AN  - 2433998876
AB  - Public abortion attitudes are important predictors of abortion stigma and accessibility, even in legal settings like the U.S. and South Africa. With data from the U.S. General Social Survey and South African Social Attitudes Survey, we used ordinal logistic regressions to measure whether abortion acceptability (in cases of poverty and fetal anomaly) is related to attitudes about social welfare programs and gender roles, then assessed differences by race/ethnicity and education. Social welfare program attitudes did not correlate with abortion acceptability in the U.S., but in South Africa, greater support for income equalization (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41–0.85) and increased government spending on the poor (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49–0.91) correlated with lower abortion acceptability in circumstances of poverty. This was significant for Black African and higher educated South Africans. In the U.S., egalitarian gender role attitudes correlated with higher acceptability of abortion in circumstances of poverty (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03–1.36) and fetal anomaly (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01–1.31). This was significant for White and less educated Americans. In South Africa, egalitarian gender role attitudes correlated with higher abortion acceptability for fetal anomaly (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01–1.25) overall and among Black and less educated respondents, but among non-Black South Africans they correlated with higher abortion acceptability in circumstances of poverty. These results suggest abortion attitudes are distinctly related to socioeconomic and gender ideology depending one’s national context, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Reducing abortion stigma will require community-based approaches rooted in intersectional reproductive justice frameworks.

T1  - Profiles of Multi-cultural Identity Integration in a Conflictual Context
AN  - 2476845373
AB  - This study addressed the phenomenon of multiple social identities in a conflictual context. It examined the case of Palestinian-Christians living in Israel, a nation imbued with ethno-religious conflict, a complex combination of three distinct collective identities: national (Palestinian- Arab), ethno-religious (Christian), and civic (Israeli). The current study proposed a conceptual and methodological expansion of the "Bicultural Identity Integration" (BII) model (Benet- Martinez & Haritatos, 2005) as a way to assess different levels of integration between three types of identities (national, ethno-religious, and civic) in a sample of 383 Palestinian Christians with Israeli citizenship. Results revealed that the three integrations of BII (Arab-Christian, Arab-Israeli, Christian-Israeli) are positively predicted by favorable intergroup contact with Jews and Muslims and negatively by discrimination by these groups. Further, Latent Profile Analyses revealed four distinct identity profiles: two ("Pro-Arab" and "Pro-Israel") were highly conflictual and characterized by both discrimination and negative intergroup contact, and two ("Ambivalent" and "Peaceful") were characterized by less conflict across pairs of identities. These findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical contribution to the study of multiple social and collective identities in contexts of conflict, and their practical implications for the groups under study.

T1  - Effects of intergroup contact and relative gratification vs. deprivation on prejudice on both sides of the U.S./Mexico status divide
AN  - 2419853656
AB  - A study in the U.S.–Mexican intergroup context examined how collective relative gratification (RG) versus deprivation affects the relationship between intergroup contact and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice towards an out‐group. Participants were Mexican university students in Mexico (N = 239) and non‐Mexican students in California (N = 90). As predicted, Mexicans experienced less gratification/higher relative deprivation (RD), and low quality intergroup contact and expressed lower interpersonal closeness and higher subtle prejudice than U.S. Americans. Differences between countries were larger amongst participants reporting higher RD. Second‐stage moderated mediation analysis showed that the mediating effects of contact between country and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice, respectively, were larger amongst participants who felt relatively gratified than those who felt relatively deprived. These findings underline the importance of recognizing the moderating effect of differences in the RG versus RD levels of minority and majority groups when anticipating the potential benefits of intergroup contact for prejudice reduction.

T1  - How Would Low-Income Communities Prioritize Medicaid Spending?
AN  - 2507993099
AB  - Context: Medicaid plays a critical role in low-income, minority, and medically underserved communities, particularly in states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Yet, the voices of underresourced communities are often unheard in decisions about how to allocate Medicaid's scarce resources, and traditional methods of public engagement are poorly suited to gathering such input. We argue that deliberative public engagement can be a useful tool for involving communities in setting Medicaid priorities.
Method: We engaged 209 residents of low-income, medically underserved Michigan communities in discussions about Medicaid spending priorities using an exercise in informed deliberation: CHAT (CHoosing All Together). Participants learned about Medicaid, deliberated in small groups, and set priorities both individually and collectively.
Findings: Participants prioritized broad eligibility consistent with the ACA expansion, accepted some cost sharing, and prioritized spending in areas—including mental health—that are historically underfunded. Participants allocated less funding beyond benefit coverage, such as spending on healthy communities. Participants perceived the deliberative process as fair and informative, and they supported using it in the policy-making process.
Conclusion: The choices of participants from low-income, medically underserved communities reflect a unique set of priorities and suggest that engaging low-income communities more deeply in Medicaid policy making might result in different prioritization decisions.

T1  - An Ethnic Relations between Immigrant-based Groups in the Light of Florian Znaniecki's Theory. (Ethnic Relations as a Type of Social Relations: Case Study on Polish-Ukrainian Relations in Diaspora Situation)
AN  - 2431837783
AB  - This presentation is related to three aspects of the sociological theory of Florian Znaniecki and William Thomas: the concept of ethnic relations and immigrants attitudes in diaspora situation as well as the concept of recreate and building of an ethnic community. The main problem tackled in the paper can be narrowed down to the question: whether and how is the system of social relationships between different ethnic groups transferred into a migration situation? Relations between Polish and Ukrainian immigrants will be use as an example. What guides this paper is trading these realtions in the sphere of everyday life in one of New York's Lower Manhattan neighborhoods - East Village, where Polish and Ukrainian ethnic community in New York City formed in the second half of the 19th century. The text portrays the community eastablished by the immigrants, and especially its past and the character of Polish-Ukrainian neighborhood, which, as it turns out, resembles Polish-Ukrainian in the European borderland. In the analysis particular attention will be focus on microsocial determinants of mutual relationships as well as on the various elements of interethnic relations, including: spheres of cooperation, conflict areas, daily interactions, ethnic distance, mutual perceptions, etc. The text will give a short outline of the process of shaping and functioning of the ethnic community, its character, as well as the processes of changes of the ethnic community.

This study examined in-group favoritism (White preference) and out-group rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent (representing the Muslim minority) among White children in the Netherlands. Social preference for and rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent are compared with preference for and rejection of Black children. Social preference and rejection were measured using a task in which participants were presented with pictures of children with different ethnic appearances, and asked to select who they wanted to (not) play with, (not) sit next to, and invite for their birthday party. In addition, maternal implicit prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent and explicit attitudes toward their children’s interethnic contact were assessed. The study included 140 children aged 6 to 8 years (M = 7.26, SD = 0.77) and their mothers. The results reveal both in-group favoritism and out-group rejection. The Middle Eastern out-group was preferred less than the Black out-group. Reporting absolutely no reservations about children’s interethnic contact by mothers was associated with less rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent. Findings reveal that young children already show interethnic prejudice and that particularly people of Middle Eastern descent are devalued. The results show that maternal acceptance of child interethnic contact seems to play a role, and provide starting points for further investigation of the relation between parental and child interethnic attitudes.

T1  - Is negative mass media news always associated with outgroup prejudice? The buffering role of direct contact: GPIR
AN  - 2343004646
AB  - We examined the association of the combination of direct intergroup contact and mass media news with attitudes toward immigrants and gay people in Italy, hypothesizing that direct intergroup contact would buffer the negative association between media news and attitudes, but only when contact was intimate or positive. Measuring contact variables and attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1, N = 428; Study 2, N = 426) and gay men and women (Study 3, N = 220), we found that intimate and positive direct intergroup contact was associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroup members, whereas exposure to negative news was related to more negative attitudes. Moreover, our results supported the buffering hypothesis, as the negative association between negative news and intergroup attitudes was significantly weaker amongst respondents with higher levels of intimate and positive intergroup contact.

T1  - The role of group size in reactions to ostracism and inclusion: GPIR
AN  - 2109035393
AB  - Three experiments examined the effects of group size on reactions to ostracism and inclusion. Participants engaged in an online introduction activity with 2 or 6 other people and received likes from everyone (inclusion) or no one (ostracism). In Studies 1 and 2, group size had a significant effect on need satisfaction only when participants were ostracized, with larger groups threatening needs to a greater extent. These effects were evident during and immediately after the task, but not after a reflection period and delay. In Study 3, being ostracized by a larger group increased sadness and anger only when ostracism was public. Together, these results indicate that people react more negatively to ostracism by larger groups, but do not reap greater benefits in terms of need satisfaction or affect when included by larger groups. Implications for the ostracism literature and social media use are discussed.

T1  - Citizen Support for Military Expenditure Post–9/11
AN  - 2096241801
AB  - Citizens adjust their perceptions of military expenditure based largely on their worldview, as defined by their race, ethnicity, ideology, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and education. Worldview might also reasonably be impacted by nativity. We explore the relationship between nativity and public opinion about military expenditure. Native-born survey respondents are less likely to believe that military expenditures are excessive than those born abroad. Race, ethnicity, ideology, nativity, and confidence in the military are the most significant variables used in explaining attitudes about military expenditure. Interaction analysis carried out for this article and reported here demonstrates that Hispanic and Asian ethnicity impacts on public perception of military expenditure are significantly greater when factoring in the nativity of survey respondents. With a growing portion of non-native-born citizens joining the electorate, public opinion analyses regarding military expenditure should take into account nativity as well as SES, gender, race, ideology, education, and ethnicity when seeking to explain public opinion dynamics.

T1  - Truth Bias and Partisan Bias in Political Deception Detection
AN  - 2084681764
AB  - This study tests the effects of political partisanship on voters’ perception and detection of deception. Based on social identity theory, in-group members should consider their politician’s message truthful while the opposing out-group would consider the message deceptive. Truth-default theory predicts that a salient in-group would be susceptible to deception from their in-group politician. In an experiment, partisan voters in the United States (N = 618) watched a news interview in which a politician was labeled Democratic or Republican. The politician either answered all the questions or deceptively evaded a question. Results indicated that the truth bias largely prevailed. Voters were more likely to be accurate in their detection when the politician answered and did not dodge. Truth-default theory appears robust in a political setting, as truth bias holds (as opposed to deception bias). Accuracy in detection also depends on group affiliation. In-groups are accurate when their politician answers, and inaccurate when he dodges. Out-groups are more accurate than in-groups when a politician dodges, but still exhibit truth bias.

T1  - When intergroup apology is not enough: Seeking help and reactions to receiving help among members of low status groups
AN  - 2011519344
AB  - Relations between groups are characterized by competition and suspicion. As a consequence, members of low status groups may question the meaning of apologies offered by a high status group, especially under unstable status relations. In two experiments, the present research investigated the role of the intergroup versus interpersonal apology and the potential moderating effect of the stability of intergroup relations on low status group members' (a) help seeking (Study 1) and (b) responses to receiving help (Study 2) from a high status group. Consistent with our hypotheses, when status relations were unstable rather than stable, following a formal intergroup relative to an interpersonal apology by an Israeli official, Israeli‐Arab students sought less dependency‐oriented and more autonomy‐oriented help from an Israeli‐Jewish study coordinator (Study 1) and Jewish‐Ethiopian newcomers reacted more negatively when they read about an Ethiopian‐Jewish student receiving unsolicited dependency‐oriented help from an Israeli‐Jewish college student (Study 2). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Respecting the LDS/Mormon Minority on Campus: College Students’ Attitudes Toward Latter‐Day Saints
AN  - 2047457492
AB  - Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter‐Day Saints remain a minoritized and marginalized population in the United States at large, a pattern mirrored on the majority of college and university campuses across the United States. This study addresses how social identities, institutional contexts, and intergroup dynamics within the postsecondary education environment contribute to cultivating college students’ attitudes toward LDS/Mormons and Mormonism. Using data collected from 13,584 college students attending 52 institutions across the country, the study employs multilevel modeling to examine these relationships. The analyses highlight the importance of productive interreligious contact in a supportive institutional context for shaping out‐group attitudes. Affirming the interplay between social identity and intergroup contact, effects on out‐group attitudes vary to some extent by religion/worldview. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Being different at work: How gender dissimilarity relates to social inclusion and absenteeism: GPIR
AN  - 1978441021
AB  - We investigated how and when gender dissimilarity relates to two highly important individual work outcomes: social inclusion and absenteeism. We collected survey data among 397 employees from a university of applied sciences and combined these with data from the organization's personnel administration. Our results indicate that dissimilarity was negatively related to perceived work group inclusion. In addition, this negative effect was stronger when the group was perceived to have a negative diversity climate. Finally, there was a conditional indirect effect of gender dissimilarity on absenteeism through inclusion. That is, being different from other group members in terms of gender was associated with higher absenteeism through lower levels of perceived inclusion, but only when the group was perceived to have a negative diversity climate. Together, the present research demonstrates that sometimes being different is associated with more absences and underlines the importance of establishing a positive climate for gender diversity.

T1  - Racial attitude (dis)similarity and liking in same-race minority interactions: GPIR
AN  - 1928333122
AB  - Two studies investigate the relationship between racial attitude (dis)similarity and interpersonal liking for racial minorities and Whites in same-race and cross-race pairs. In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.

T1  - Taking it to the Street: Reclaiming Australia in the Top End
AN  - 1923055496
AB  - Since Cronulla, racism and the resurgence of White ethno-nationalism is again contesting the diversity of Australian national imaginaries. This paper argues, however, that encounters with Aboriginality and connection to Country provide fresh perspectives that affirm difference. The paper focuses on Broome and Darwin, two urban centres in northern Australia with a visible Aboriginal population that have been the focus of little contemporary research on intercultural relations compared to southern cities. Such an optics from the Top End is necessary, given its unique histories of Aboriginal and ethnic minority contact that predate White settlement, as well as the ongoing resistance to dehumanising, interventionist and racially discriminatory practices and policies. This paper places affirmative 'events of commoning' at the core of emancipatory politics. Such a politics is informed by the theoretical conceptualisation of commoning as a relational process of 'being-in-common' that unfolds in cooperative practices and collective action. We focus on two events - a protest event in Broome as response to the closure of remote Aboriginal communities and a 'celebration walk' through the streets of Darwin during NAIDOC week. These 'noisy' and 'quiet' struggles reclaim the street and provide the possibility to think about how a common world can be recomposed through embodied potentiality.

T1  - Changing Identities: A Case Study of Western Muslim Converts Whose Conversion Revised Their Relationship to Their National Identity
AN  - 1892718795
AB  - Few studies explore the impact conversion to Islam has on a Western individual's social identity configuration. This article focuses on six Western Muslim converts-three from Montreal, two from Berlin, and one from Copenhagen-who experienced difficulties relating to their national identities prior to conversion, exploring how it developed afterwards. A qualitative interview guide was adapted in a semi-structured format to the demands of each individual, and interviews were analyzed applying thematic content analysis. The participants reveal how they revised their social identity configuration upon conversion, ultimately reversing their antagonistic relationship to their national identity. Their narratives relate how political realities are embedded in the perception and development of the Western Muslim identity, necessitating a revaluation of their national identity as a form of social critique. Our results demonstrate how socio-political experiences of discrimination and race are all significantly implicated in the process of conversion and Muslim identity development.

T1  - Stereotyping the Shire: Assigning White Privilege to Place and Identity
AN  - 1922921454
AB  - Through a focus on the media's role in constructing and maintaining stereotypes of white privilege and racism, this paper investigates the stereotyping of the Sutherland Shire, Sydney, Australia, and its residents. Print media plays a significant role in constructing social identities, shaping public opinion and typecasting public perception. Using a media content analysis and surveys with residents and non-residents of the Sutherland Shire we (de)construct the area's positioning in media discourse as white, insular and privileged. Pivotal to this investigation was the 2005 Cronulla riots and their influence on assertions of white privilege and racism, in the media and by non-Sutherland Shire residents. While not vindicating some resident's roles in the riots, we reason that such typecasting provides an avenue for the predominately white media, and white Sydney to deflect responsibility for their own whiteness by attributing and spatializing racist sentiment to elsewhere in Sydney.

T1  - Opposing Gazes: Racism and Xenophobia in South African Schools
AN  - 1871594476
AB  - Utilising a qualitative case study approach, this research study set out to understand discrimination experienced by immigrant students in their interactions with South African students and the prejudice immigrant students expressed against Black South African students. Findings reveal that the discrimination experienced by immigrant students could be clustered into four broad themes, namely categorisations and prototypes; practised stereotypes; academic and social exclusion; and work ethic. Furthermore, statements immigrant students make about South African students seem to fall into two broad categories, namely lack of value for moral integrity and lack of value for education. Educating students to value human dignity and to view each other as cosmopolitan citizens of the world could be a way to ensure social cohesion and harmony of future generations to come.

T1  - The Unravelling of Identities and Belonging: Criminal Gang Involvement of Youth from Immigrant Families
AN  - 1865257114
AB  - Grounded in the experiences of 30 gang-involved respondents in Calgary, this Canadian study examined criminal gang involvement of youth from immigrant families. Our analysis showed that gang-involved youth had experienced multiple, severe and prolonged personal and interpersonal challenges in all facets of their lives and that gradual disintegration of their relationships with family, school and community had resulted in the unravelling of self-concept, ethnic identity, sense of belonging and sense of citizenship and progressively propelled them towards membership in high-risk social cliques and criminal gangs. Our findings brought attention to the need for coordinated, comprehensive support for youth from immigrant families through family-based, school-based and community-based programs.

T1  - Trump's Impact: The End of Sameness
AN  - 1865256240
AB  - In his startling run for president, Donald Trump dared to question the official orthodoxy that all races and ethic groups are the same. He is correct in that most seriously poor, many immigrants, and the radicals we face overeas all come from outside the West. Thus, according to world cultures research, they are much less individualist and more conformist than most Americans. This cultural difference goes far to explain the major challenges the United States faces both at home and abroad. But Trump's bold challenge offers no easy solutions.

T1  - Family and Schooling Experiences in Racial/Ethnic Academic Achievement Gaps: A Cumulative Perspective
AN  - 1862124599
AB  - The gap in academic skills between white and historically disadvantaged racial/ethnic minority children exists at school entry and grows over time. Research over the last two decades has identified the important role of schools in perpetuating these disparities and the limited role of family experiences. Much of this research, however, has relied on strategies that consider only snapshots of children's experiences and has assumed that family and schooling experiences have the same benefit for everyone. For this study, we examine racial/ethnic differences in children's achievement through a cumulative framework that focuses on differences in the overall amounts of accumulated experiences and whether these experiences have similar benefits for all children. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K), we find that cumulative experiences explain a moderate portion of the gap in reading and math gains between white and historically disadvantaged minority children. In addition, there is evidence that family and schooling experiences matter differently by race/ethnicity. [web URL: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0731121416629989]

T1  - Choosing to Stay: (Im)Mobility Decisions Amongst Mongolia's Ethnic Kazakhs
AN  - 1919661820
AB  - One of the defining characteristics of globalization is the increased flow of migrants across international borders. Fluctuating migration flows in rural communities of the Global South have the potential to significantly contribute to or undermine the livelihoods of local residents. Households that choose not to migrate, that remain immobile, play a key role in sustaining rural communities. Migration studies in the Global South, however, have largely neglected these households. Utilizing questionnaire and life history interview data collected between 2006 and 2009, we examine immobility amongst the Kazakh ethnic minority population in rural Mongolia. Our findings challenge the dichotomous portrayal of immobile households as either 'left behind' or 'embedded' within their community, providing evidence that immobility decisions are both fluid and flexible and require more interrogation from scholars. Our findings help broaden the social and cultural context in which immobility studies are conducted and the characterization of immobility amongst non-migrant populations. More broadly, this study contributes to our understanding of the implications to livelihood sustainability in rural communities.

T1  - Racial bullying and adolescent substance use: An examination of school-attending young adolescents in the United States
AN  - 1874421819
AB  - This article examines the association between race and racial bullying (bullying due to one's race), in relation to youth substance use in school attending young adolescents in the United States. Weighted unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models were run to assess if racial bullying involvement was associated with youth substance use. Data for this study come from the Health Behaviors in School-Aged Children survey (n = 7,585). An association between racial bullying status (not involve, bullying victim, bullying perpetrator, or mixed bullying victim/perpetrator) and youth substance was identified in this study. Racial bully perpetrators were most likely to have used cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana, followed by youth in the mixed victim/perpetrator group. When analyses were stratified by race, non-Hispanic White and Hispanic youth experienced an increased risk of cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use if in the perpetrator or mixed group (compared to those not involved with racial bullying). Non-Hispanic White and Asian youth were also more likely to report marijuana use if in the victim group. Non-Hispanic Black youth were more likely to use alcohol and marijuana if they were a perpetrator or in the mixed group, but they were not more likely to use cigarettes. Differences appear to exist in relation to racial bullying experience and substance across racial/ethnic group among youth in grades 7-10. Implications for prevention and educational professionals are discussed.

T1  - Backlash
AN  - 1851015856
AB  - Research suggests that members of advantaged groups who feel dehumanized by other groups respond aggressively. But little is known about how meta-dehumanization affects disadvantaged minority group members, historically the primary targets of dehumanization. We examine this important question in the context of the 2016 U.S. Republican Primaries, which have witnessed the widespread derogation and dehumanization of Mexican immigrants and Muslims. Two initial studies document that Americans blatantly dehumanize Mexican immigrants and Muslims; this dehumanization uniquely predicts support for aggressive policies proposed by Republican nominees, and dehumanization is highly associated with supporting Republican candidates (especially Donald Trump). Two further studies show that, in this climate, Latinos and Muslims in the United States feel heavily dehumanized, which predicts hostile responses including support for violent versus non-violent collective action and unwillingness to assist counterterrorism efforts. Our results extend theorizing on dehumanization, and suggest that it may have cyclical and self-fulfilling consequences.

T1  - Being a freshie is (not) cool: stigma, capital and disgust in British Pakistani stereotypes of new subcontinental migrants
AN  - 1843960150
AB  - Intra-ethnic discrimination, in the form of stereotyping of recent migrants by settled ethnic minorities, has been interpreted as internalized racism, displacing stigma and negotiation of local hierarchies of belonging. Stereotypes of 'Fresh off the Boat' migrants construct cultural boundaries and assertions of belonging, offering clues to processes of identity-making where ethnicity is complicated by ongoing migration. In British Pakistani portrayals of 'freshies', this assertion of difference coexists with familial ties and a high incidence of transnational marriage. Analysis of the figure of the 'freshie' in internet comedy videos, combined with qualitative research material, provides insight into dynamics of cultural and social capital, immigration and sexuality through manifestations of difference, similarity and disgust. Together these not only reveal the weakness of recent migrants' positions in structures of socio-economic and symbolic power, but the blurring of social categories, and the continuing importance of transnational kinship in negotiations of identity amongst British Pakistanis.

T1  - Understanding defensive and secure in-group positivity: The role of collective narcissism
AN  - 1855326941
AB  - Integrating psychoanalytic ideas of group idealisation with social identity and categorisation theories, this article discusses the distinction between secure and defensive in-group positivity. Narcissistic in-group positivity captures a belief in in-group greatness that is contingent on external validation. It reflects defensive in-group positivity, insofar as it stems from the frustration of individual needs, and predicts increased sensitivity to threats as well as undesirable consequences for out-groups and the in-group. Secure in-group positivity-that is, in-group positivity without the narcissistic component-is a confidently held positive evaluation of one's in-group that is independent of the recognition of the group in the eyes of others. It stems from the satisfaction of individual needs, is resilient to threats and has positive consequences for the in-group and out-groups. I review evidence for these two distinct ways people relate to their social groups and discuss theoretical and practical implications for understanding intra- and intergroup relations.

T1  - Identity construction through English language learning in intra-national migration: a study on Uyghur students in China
AN  - 1840854475
AB  - This study explores how a group of Uyghur minority students construct their identities in and through English language learning experiences as they move from Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region to study in a prestigious East coastal university in China. The research findings show that the processes of English language learning enable the ethnic minority students to develop multiple yet powerful identities, that is, a situated elite identity constructed as opposed to other Uyghur members and a positive heritage identity negotiated within the academic community, and allow them to imagine multilingual and multicultural memberships for themselves. The favourable identities thus forged are found to facilitate their adaptation to the host community. However, these minority elites are confronted with a series of problems in learning English compared to their Han counterparts, which hinder their socialisation into the society and upward social mobility. Finally, implications for policy-makers, the host institution, and ethnic students are discussed.

T1  - "Living in Our Own World": Parental Influence on the Identity Development of Second-Generation Ethiopian and Eritrean Youth During Their Formative Years
AN  - 1830616470
AB  - This study explored the process of identity formation of second-generation Ethiopian and Eritrean youth in Toronto, Canada. Analysis of 20 in-depth interviews presented pathways of acculturation whereby first-generation parents parlay their adaptive process onto their children, influencing the self-identity trajectories and repertoires of the children in their formative years. Findings suggest that parental, social, and cultural forces are an inseparable and critical component of the development of identity. Participants' identity formation in their formative years was one of high-level cultural identity with their parents' culture of origin.

T1  - Racialized classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school: the silencing, disparagement, and discipline of students of color
AN  - 1811371214
AB  - In both Europe and the US, racial and ethnic minority students experience discrimination at the hands of teachers that negatively impacts academic achievement. In the US, scholars have documented how a predominantly white teaching force racializes students of color through discipline and low expectations, which impact educational attainment. But in Europe, the denial of race's existence hinders research regarding structural explanations for minority educational inequality and often explains low educational attainment as a function of cultural differences. Examining classroom practices in a diverse Amsterdam primary school, this article documents racializing mechanisms that found minority students disproportionately disparaged, disciplined, and silenced. In addition, many were students under-recommended to higher level secondary school tracks. These findings reveal that Dutch schools are not racially meritocratic institutions and are relevant for scholars in the Netherlands and all other nations with educational institutions dominated by colorblind ideologies, white norms, and large immigrant populations.

T1  - The significance of race/ethnicity in adolescent violence: A decade of review, 2005-2015
AN  - 1814123937
AB  - As the United States enters a demographic landscape where racial and ethnic minorities will represent more than half of the adolescent population, this current state-of-the art review highlights pertinent research that focuses on race/ethnicity for interpersonal adolescent violence published between 2005 and 2015. A systematic and exhaustive search of several academic databases such as Criminal Justice Abstracts, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO Host was conducted. Google Scholar searches were conducted to locate articles that are "in press." This state-of-the-art review discusses the complexities in the relationship between race, ethnicity, and interpersonal adolescent violence, as well as the theoretical and policy implications. These studies are relevant because they elucidate existing criminological theories and inform policies and programs aimed at curtailing adolescent violence.

T1  - Are Peripheral Regions Benefiting from National Policies Aimed at Attracting Skilled Migrants? Case Study of the Northern Territory of Australia
AN  - 1811200502
AB  - Complex and interrelated trends in population and labour market dynamics in peripheral regions of developed countries have compelled them to use international skilled migration to address their skill shortages and facilitate economic development. Using the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia as a case study, this paper examines if and how these regions can benefit from a national policy for skilled migration, including the regional migration policy, which Australia has been operating since 1996-1997. The paper situates the regional migration policy in a context of the global competition for skills, explains how it came about and outlines the key characteristics of the NT as a peripheral region. An innovative approach to immigration data analysis permits formulating four propositions about the nature of international migration to peripheral regions. The analysis consists of tracking over a period of 17 years, the dynamics between all components of Australia's and the Northern Territory's permanent additions and comparing changes in the composition of their respective skilled migration streams. The paper proposes that peripheral regions benefit from skilled migration with a lagged effect as compared to Australia as a whole. It suggests that in order to better address skill shortages, they should also develop the capacity of the locally resident immigrant groups.

T1  - Adaptation, rationality, and advancement: ethnic Albanian organized crime in New York City
AN  - 1800073108
AB  - The objective of this research is to understand the expansion and advancement of ethnic Albanian organized crime groups in New York City. Many European law enforcement agencies have depicted Albanian organized crime groups as dangerous due to their ability to overcome obstacles, their propensity to use violence, and also because they have progressed from simple service providers to working within the highest echelons of international organized crime. This research examines whether Albanian organized crime groups in New York City have developed more stable structures through the strategic acquisition of information. The article tries to answer: Do Albanian organized crime groups in New York have a long-term strategy for advancement? Are they more risk-seeking and irrational than other organized crime offenders, or are they more risk-averse and rational? Are they malleable learning organizations? This study takes both a thematic and chronological approach, and examines the process of change across four key areas (structure of the criminal organizations; criminal activities; violence; and infiltration and corruption) and over three time periods (1975-1991; 1992-2002; 2003-2014). The conclusions are based on content analysis of court files and official government documents as well as interviews with law enforcement officials and Albanian organized crime offenders, inside and outside of U.S. Federal Prisons.

T1  - Rising Mercury, Rising Hostility
AN  - 1796341147
AB  - Recent social scientific research has examined connections between public opinion and weather conditions. This article contributes to this literature by analyzing the relationship between high temperature and survey response. Because hot temperatures are associated with aggression, irritation, and negativity, such conditions should lead to the expression of aggression, irritation, and negativity in survey response. This relationship is tested in a likely realm: feelings about policies relating to racial minorities. Data are drawn from the National Climatic Data Center and the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Logistic regressions demonstrate that even after controlling for demographic and geographic factors, average daily temperatures above 74°F are associated with preferences for a stricter immigration policy as well as against permissive affirmative action policies. Acknowledging the role of this contextual variable reduces nonrandom error in estimates of public opinion on these issues.

T1  - Organization-based self-esteem in work teams: GPIR
AN  - 1786223332
AB  - It is now known that organization-based self-esteem (OBSE) correlates consistently with employee attributes that are important to the success of organizations, such as in-role and extra-role job performance, job satisfaction, organization commitment, and turnover intentions (see Bowling, Eschelman, Wang, Kirkendall, & Alarcon, 2010; Pierce & Gardner, 2004). The three major categories of OBSE antecedents (organization systems, messages from significant others, and experiences of success) have also been well studied, with one major exception. We do not know if, or how the experience of working in a group (team) environment affects employees' OBSE level, and how OBSE might affect attitudes towards and the effectiveness of that group environment. This study develops hypotheses about the genesis of OBSE in work groups, and its relationships with work group satisfaction and perceptions of group member effectiveness. In three different organizations we found that OBSE correlates with coworker and team satisfaction, as well as perceived team member effectiveness. Theoretical and managerial implications of the results are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/3/394.abstract]

T1  - Explaining Ethnic Differences: Can Ethnic Minority Strategies Reduce the Effects of Ethnic Penalties?
AN  - 1802763152
AB  - Some social scientists are sceptical of the explanatory power of ethnicity and seek to explain ethnic differences by references to non-ethnic factors such as discrimination. We challenge this scepticism by considering two theoretical objections: there is no such thing as ethnicity and ethnic categories are unable to explain social processes; and by showing how ethnic strategies affect outcomes that cannot be captured in standard ethnic penalty analyses, we offer a new way to examine ethnic penalties in unemployment. We calculate a set of net ethnic penalties and then analyse longitudinal labour-force data to examine how strategies such as self-employment change ethnic penalties in unemployment amongst six different ethnic groups in Britain. The results show that self-employment reduces the ethnic penalty for Indians, Pakistanis-Bangladeshis and others, but not for Blacks, White-Others and White-British. This supports the argument that ethnicity can provide an explanation for some of the ethnic differentials in the labour market.

T1  - Is There an Oppositional Culture Among Immigrant Adolescents in the Netherlands?
AN  - 1772855778
AB  - This study examines oppositional culture among immigrant and majority adolescents in the Netherlands. Oppositional culture theory expects that immigrant adolescents would uphold positive attitudes towards education. The social exclusion theory predicts instead that immigrant adolescents develop an oppositional culture, particularly in ethnically concentrated schools. To test these ideas, we make use of one of the first large-scale studies on oppositional culture in the Netherlands, and in Europe more generally. Applying multilevel analyses to a survey across 340 schools among 11,215 adolescents aged 11 to 19, we find no clear evidence that immigrant adolescents support oppositional culture either more or less than majority adolescents. Results however showed that oppositional culture differs across schools and that in more ethnically concentrated schools, there is a higher tendency for ethnic minority adolescents to skip classes. Furthermore, oppositional culture finds more support among adolescents who are in a higher grade, male, and who attend a lower education track.

Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted in Toronto and Vancouver, the study examines how transnational cultural flow is articulated with social media and ethnic sociality. In the study, while the transnational flow of Korean media content was largely reliant on social media, it was renegotiated by the users' subject positions as ethnic minorities and by their ethnic networks in the Canadian cities.

T1  - Collective action from a distance: Distance shapes how people view victims of injustice and decreases willingness to engage in collective action: GPIR
AN  - 1752001314
AB  - The present research examines whether distance affects not only how people view victims of injustice, but also group members' willingness to engage in collective action. Across two experiments, examining both spatial (Experiment 1) and temporal (Experiment 2) distance, distant victims were seen as less familiar and more likely to be viewed at a relatively more superordinate level of identity (less in terms of subgroup identity) compared to near victims. In addition, participants were less willing to engage in collective action on behalf of distant victims, relative to near victims. Across studies, decreased collective action on behalf of distant victims, relative to near victims, was explained by the tendency to view victims in a more abstract way -- as less familiar (Experiment 2) and at a more superordinate level (Experiments 1 and 2). Across both studies, results also demonstrated that participants were less willing to engage in collective action on behalf of out-group targets, relative to in-group targets, which was explained by perceptions of familiarity (Experiment 2). Implications for collective action and more broadly social change are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/27.abstract]

T1  - Impact of Identity on Support for New Roles in Health Care: A Language Inquiry of Doctors' Commentary
AN  - 1735732704
AB  - Identity threat can be understood from a social identity perspective where people interrelate based on group memberships. Language use may indicate the presence of identity threat. We explored reactions of doctors to planned expanded roles for nurses to perform gastrointestinal endoscopy in Australia. Specialist doctors have traditionally performed endoscopic procedures, yet the level of doctor support for nurse endoscopy is relatively unknown. We present results of our valence and discourse analyses of text box responses in a national survey that explored doctors' attitudes toward this role expansion. We found low levels of support for the role, and frequent expression of identity threat in three main areas: (1) framing nurses as incompetent, (2) use of contracted statements to evoke authority, and (3) emotive expression. Findings indicated that stakeholders should consider intergroup attitudes when facilitating changes in health professional scope of practice.

T1  - Multiculturalism on Its Head: Unexpected Boundaries and New Migration in Singapore
AN  - 1724872546
AB  - This study investigates how discourses of multiculturalism shape public debates surrounding new migration in Singapore. Singapore's immigration policies led to the influx of Chinese and Indian professionals, many of whom share race and class identities with local Singaporeans. However, Singaporeans of Chinese and Indian backgrounds rejected these presumed similarities, using discourses of multiculturalism to differentiate themselves from co-ethnic migrants. Based on a content analysis of news reports and online forums, this study shows how local actors portrayed new migrants as too prejudiced or bigoted to adapt to Singapore's multiracial society, thereby creating a paradoxical application of multicultural ideals. This example highlights how contemporary immigration is creating diverse forms of inclusion and exclusion within migrant-receiving nations, challenging models, and policies of multiculturalism based solely on ethnicity and race. This paper also demonstrates how individuals can utilize the discourse of multiculturalism in forwarding their own interests and concerns. Scholarly debates have often portrayed multiculturalism as an ideology or policy imposed by state institutions, where local actors are left to either resist or accommodate such ideas. In the Singapore context, individual Singaporeans transform discourses of multiculturalism, creating a counter-discourse that challenges state immigration policies.

T1  - When bias binds: Effect of implicit outgroup bias on ingroup affiliation
AN  - 1767327297; 201605543
AB  - We tested a novel process we term implicit homophily in which perceivers' implicit outgroup bias shapes their affiliative responses toward ingroup targets with outgroup friends as a function of perceived similarity. Across 4 studies, we tested implicit homophily in the context of racial groups. We found that White participants with higher implicit anti-Black bias reported less affiliative responses toward White targets with Black friends compared with White targets with White friends, and this effect persisted above and beyond the effects of implicit pro-White bias and explicit racial bias (Studies 1-3). We further found evidence that this relationship between implicit anti-Black bias and affiliation exists because participants infer how comfortable targets are around outgroup members (Preliminary Study) and use this information to infer similarity on this dimension (Studies 1-3). Our findings also suggested that stigma transference and expectancy violation were not viable alternative mediators (Preliminary Study and Study 1). Finally, women's implicit anti-Black bias predicted their likelihood of having Facebook friends with Black friends, providing ecological and behavioral evidence of implicit homophily (Study 4). Implications for research on stigma by association, extended contact, affiliation, and network formation are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Us and Them: Black-White Relations in the Wake of Hispanic Population Growth
AN  - 1728663114; 201534018
AB  - How will Hispanic population growth affect black-white relations in the United States? Research on intergroup relations operates within a two-group paradigm, furnishing few insights into multi-group contexts. This study is based on an original experiment that combines behavioral game and survey methods to evaluate the impact of perceived Hispanic growth on attitudes and behavior. Results reveal opposite reactions among blacks and whites. Whites in the baseline condition contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients in a dictator game, whereas whites who first read about Hispanic growth contribute more to white recipients than to black ones. By contrast, blacks in the baseline condition contribute more to black recipients than to white ones, whereas blacks who first read about Hispanic growth contribute comparable amounts to black and white recipients. Patterns of identification mirror patterns of contributions: whites exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their racial group than with their national group, whereas blacks exposed to Hispanic growth identify relatively more strongly with their national group than with their racial group. Together, these results suggest that people respond to the growth of a third group by prioritizing the most privileged identity to which they can plausibly lay claim and which also excludes the growing group.

T1  - Does Anti-Hispanic Bias Motivate Opposition to Non-English Languages?
AN  - 1728660554; 201535385
AB  - Contemporary political debates about language policy in the United States focus on three primary policy issues: bilingual education in public schools, English-only legislation, and the access of non-English speaking citizens to political rights. Using the 'Multi-Ethnic United States' module from the 2000 General Social Survey (GSS), this article tests multiple attitudinal, behavioral, demographic, and contextual hypotheses for how Anglos and African Americans view bilingual policy issues. We examine the role of linguistic contact, self-interest, group threat, and discriminatory views of Latinos, finding that the latter-as measured by the 'Three Ds' (Derogation, Disrespect, and Distance)-are the strongest predictors of attitudes toward bilingualism. Distance (social distance from Latinos) is consistently significant, disrespect (doubts about Latino contributions to the United States.) is mostly significant, and derogation (Latino stereotypes) is occasionally significant. Also, political ideology and knowledge of a non-English language play important roles in the formation of favorable bilingualism opinions. However, the self-interest and group threat variables were largely insignificant. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of understanding how policy views may be structured by opinions about out-group individuals and cultures. Language can serve as a proxy for immigrants themselves, as negative attitudes toward Latinos are associated with negative attitudes toward bilingualism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - My Friend is Gay, But… The Effects of Social Contact on Christian Evangelicals’ Beliefs About Gays and Lesbians
AN  - 1962749713
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between social contact with gays and lesbians and beliefs about homosexuality, and explicitly investigates whether this relationship is different for Christian evangelicals than for others. We find that although social contact with gays and lesbians is related to beliefs about homosexuality in ways predicted by social contact theory, those with a gay or lesbian friend hold more positive attitudes, this is not the case for Christian evangelicals. In fact, analyses reveal that the effect of social contact for Christian evangelicals is significantly less than the effect for non-evangelicals. Results suggest that social contact alone is not enough to positively change Christian evangelicals’ beliefs about gay and lesbian individuals. This research adds to our knowledge about social contact by providing empirical evidence that all subgroups of the population are not affected equally by social contact with minority groups—an important piece of information for theoretical developments and policy makers.

T1  - An essentialism perspective on intercultural processes
AN  - 1700676770; 201524942
AB  - Essentialist theories are the beliefs that there are immutable essences underlying observed differences between social groups (e.g. racial group, cultural group). This paper reviews the intergroup dynamics and intrapersonal processes associated with essentialism. It also explores the interplay between the two. By explicating the intricate relationship between these psychological processes, the current paper aims to advance our understanding of intergroup relations and identify their implications for the study of multiculturalism. We posit that although the commonly observed negative intergroup outcomes, such as prejudices and biases, can be the byproducts of basic cognitive processes associated with essentialist theories, the social power dynamics in a given society also play important roles in shaping the relationships between essentialism and intergroup outcomes. We then discuss the implications of this understanding to our increasingly multicultural world. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National and regional proportion of immigrants and perceived threat of immigration: A three-level analysis in Western Europe
AN  - 1790890881
AB  - Immigration is of growing significance to the demographic makeup of Western Europe. A long-standing and highly disputed question is whether a larger number of immigrants are associated with more negative attitudes toward immigration or whether the reverse is true. Previous studies yielded contradictory results on various levels of analysis (national, regional, local). These inconsistencies may partly be linked to what is known as the 'modifiable areal unit problem' in spatial analysis. This article seeks to address this issue by analyzing the relationship between the percentage foreign-born and perceived group threat in 15 Western European countries on the national as well as on three differing regional levels (
 
  N
  = 70, 207, and 624 regions, respectively), together with survey data from the European Values Study's fourth wave. I expect threat effects to operate through national communication systems while contact and habituation to immigrants to work on the regional level. Consistent with theoretical expectations, the results show a positive correlation between the national proportion of immigrants and perceived threat, while the coefficients are negative on the regional level. More immigration might thus lead to a more negative evaluation of the presence of immigrants in European countries, but apparently not within the regions where most of the newcomers reside. Two recent examples illustrate this seemingly paradoxical relationship. As a methodological result, effect size and statistical significance vary with the delimitation of the regional units of analysis (
 
  Nomenclature des Unités Territoriales Statistiques
  (NUTS)-1, -2, or -3). This suggests that research in this field should pay more attention to how and why spatial units are defined.

T1  - Can we really reduce ethnic prejudice outside the lab? A meta-analysis of direct and indirect contact interventions
AN  - 1700674929; 201525026
AB  - The present meta-analysis tested the effectiveness of contact-based interventions for the reduction of ethnic prejudice. Up to now, a meta-analysis summarizing the results of real-world interventions that rest on the intergroup contact theory has been missing. We included evaluations of programs realizing direct (i.e.,face-to-face) and/or indirect (i.e.,extended or virtual) contact in real-world settings outside the lab. The interventions' effectiveness was tested shortly after their end (k=123 comparisons, N=11371 participants) and with a delay of at least 1 month (k=25, N=1650). Our data show that contact interventions improve ethnic attitudes. Importantly, changes persist over time. Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect contact interventions are successful. In addition, contact programs are effective even in the context of a serious societal conflict (e.g.,in the Middle East). Although changes are typically larger for ethnic majorities, there is an impact on minorities, too. Finally, contact interventions not only improve attitudes toward individuals involved in the program, their effects also generalize to outgroups as a whole. In sum, social psychology provides an intervention for prejudice reduction that can be successfully implemented in the practical field. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

Meanwhile, differences among these theories are going to be explained. Drawing on theories of immigration, this paper attempts to understand the questions of "what is in common among these theories or what has changed?" In addition, this paper demonstrates how important these prevailing theories are in understanding the ongoing assimilation process of second generation immigrants in the United States. Finally, the strength, limitations and weaknesses of these aforementioned theories are explained in detail.

T1  - MAPPING THE ROMA ETHNIC MINORITY
AN  - 1735657892; 201536887
AB  - The Roma ethnic minority is a community of overall deprivation. It lacks adequate space, municipal infrastructure, capital (social, cultural, financial, etc.), and tolerance by non-Roma. It also lacks the driving forces that could move the Roma from the margins of society and allow them to participate in the management of public good. One of the reasons is the fact that spatial planning providers only made it half way. They mapped the Roma settlements but failed to plan the social anchors which provide a settlement with satisfactory vitality. These anchors make up social, human and cultural capital, which are all important components of human resources development and thus a significant source of the development efficiency of the Roma community in Slovenia. The two pillars of development - human resources and development efficiency - should both aim at reducing the exclusion of the members of the Roma ethnic minority from the Slovene society. The paper presents the main findings of the research project entitled The Increase in Social and Cultural Capital in Areas with a Roma Population. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A discourse of civilization/culture and nation/ethnicity from the perspective of inner Mongolia, China
AN  - 1660022572; 201505549
AB  - After tracking the Chinese historical trajectory on the discursive relationship between Chinese civilization and the northern nomadic group, this paper examines the official discursive construction of the 'civilization' and 'culture' of ethnic minorities in contemporary China. Through the analysis of the Grassland Culture Research Project (caoyuanwenhua yanjiu xiangmu), an official project conducted in China in recent decades in response to the emergence of nomadic civilization studies as a distinct academic field, this article aims to show the way in which the concepts of civilization and culture are utilized in order to correspond to the official discourse of nation state and ethnicity in China, and the process by which Mongolian culture is thereby transformed. Civilization as a larger body supposed to include cultures was/is entitled to Chinese nation (zhonghua minzu), and a culture (wenhua) of a certain ethnic minority could only be a part of the Chinese civilization in Chinese academia today. 'Grassland culture ' is defined as a culture that is static, ahistorical, and therefore has to be reframed within the larger system of Chinese civilization. The concept of 'grassland culture' seems to be based more on the particular territory, rather than on the types of culture that have created and are owned by different ethnic groups. Therefore, it might be concluded that the project emphasized the geo-body of the Chinese nation state in order to retain the culture within the territory of China. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact and Compromise: Explaining Support for Conciliatory Measures in the Context of Violent Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1692289725; 201524083
AB  - Objectives: Informed by intergroup contact theory, this study explores the relationships between intergroup contact, perceived out-group threat, and support for conciliatory solutions to the violent conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Methods: Regression and structural equation models analyze public opinion data collected in Israel in 2011 and 2012. The analyses assess whether quantity and quality of Israeli Jews' contact with Israeli Arabs in day-to-day encounters are associated with their support for conciliatory policies. Results: The quality, but not the quantity, of contact is associated with lower levels of perceived Palestinian threat and, in turn, with increased support for compromise. Conclusion: The current study provides initial evidence that everyday interactions with Israeli Arabs, when they occur under optimal conditions, may have the potential to reduce Israeli Jews' perceptions of Palestinian threat and, in turn, increase their support for compromise.

T1  - Creating positive out-group attitudes through intergroup couple friendships and implications for compassionate love
AN  - 1692289594; 201521301
AB  - Building personal relationships with out-group members is an important catalyst of positive intergroup attitudes. In a 2 * 2 experimental design, Caucasian and African American individuals and couples were randomly assigned to interact in either cross-race or same-race individual dyads and couple pairs. Participants completed pretest measures of race attitudes and engaged in a high self-disclosure closeness-induction task with an in-group or out-group race member in pairs of couples or individuals and completed measures of self-disclosure and intergroup attitudes. These results suggest that intergroup contact in the presence of romantic partners may be particularly effective for improving intergroup attitudes. We explore the implications of these results for developing compassionate love toward out-groups. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Conceptualization of Sexual Orientation Identity Among Sexual Minorities: Patterns Across Sexual and Gender Identity
AN  - 1680153241; 201513941
AB  - This research analyzed how sexual minority individuals discussed identity when critiquing two sexual orientation scales. To better understand the diversity of sexual minority experience, analyses focused on the patterns of responses across sexual orientation identity (monosexual, plurisexual, and asexual) and gender identity (cisgender and transgender). Participants were self-identified sexual minorities who represented a range of gender identities. Using thematic analysis, four main themes were identified related to sexual orientation identity: (1) salience of identity, (2) social identity, (3) identity development and change, and (4) identity and the body. Discussion focuses on understanding the findings in the context of intersectionality theory and emphasizes the need to conceptually disaggregate sexual orientation and gender identity. The conceptualization of sexual orientation as centered on normative assumptions of monosexuality, verisexuality/nonasexuality, genderism, and cisgenderism is also explored.

T1  - Marital Assimilation between the Muslim Hui and the Han Majority in Contemporary Chinese Cities in the People's Republic of China
AN  - 1667951723; 201509673
AB  - This study discusses the marital assimilation of the ethnic Hui, the biggest Muslim minority group in China, with the Han majority in contemporary Chinese cities, using the 1% sample data of the 1990 Chinese Census. Unlike previous research which focus on demographical, social, and cultural characteristics of ethnic minority individuals on their marital choices, this study provides a community-level analysis scrutinizing local marriage market conditions on ethnic intermarriage rate in different geographical locations. Evidently, the Hui-Han intermarriage rate in different city units varies greatly, as high as over 80% while as low as less than 30%. Furthermore, the great variation in Hui-Han intermarriage rate has been found to be highly related to three aspects of local ethnically related structures, which are ethnic demographic compositions, ethnic stratification, and interethnic contact structure. This study adds to the understanding of the integration process of Muslim minorities in a host society of a different religion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - INTERSECTIONALITY AND THE FOREIGN-BORN: EXPLAINING THE VARIATION IN THE IMMIGRATION ATTITUDES OF IMMIGRANTS *
AN  - 1751968728
AB  - This study uses an intersectionality approach to explain the variation in immigration attitudes of the foreign-born with data from the 2006 Pew Research Center's Immigration Survey. The results indicate that Black male immigrants with less than a high school degree are pro-immigrant compared to White male immigrants with a similar level of education. However, Latino male immigrants, who are typically White, are more likely to be positively affected by additional education, as are Black female immigrants, with respect to developing a pro-immigrant attitude. These differences only emerged in the interactive models. The intersectional framework offers a nuanced view of immigration attitudes and may be helpful to social organizations that work with native-born and foreign-born residents to build better intergroup relations.

T1  - Exposure to Outgroup Members Criticizing Their Own Group Facilitates Intergroup Openness
AN  - 1708527559; 201530141
AB  - A major barrier to conflict resolution is group members' tendency to hold on to the ingroup's narrative of the conflict and reject the outgroup's perspective. In the current research, we propose that voicing internal criticism to an outgroup crowd can undermine such orientations and foster intergroup openness. Across four experiments, Israeli Jews who were exposed to a Palestinian criticizing Palestinians were more open to the Palestinians' perspective of the conflict, than those not exposed to the criticism. This effect was obtained when the criticism was related (Study 1) and unrelated (Study 2) to the conflict, and was consistently mediated by increased hope about the future relations between the groups. Study 3 showed that the effect is more pronounced among those who believe that groups can change. Study 4 established that perceptions about the outgroup as open-minded underlie the effect of ingroup criticism on hope, and further demonstrated downstream effects of openness.

T1  - EFFECTS OF HIV/AIDS PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON ATTITUDE AND BEHAVIOR: INTERPLAY OF PERCEIVED THREAT AND SELF-EFFICACY
AN  - 1567048441; 201435049
AB  - We examined how perceived threat affected attitude and behavior toward condom use with main and nonmain partners, among at-risk young adults with varying levels of self-efficacy. Participants were 170 heterosexually active, single students at a northeastern university in the United States. Exposure to HIV/AIDS public service announcements was found to increase perceived susceptibility, which facilitated a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners but not with nonmain partners. High self-efficacy promoted a positive attitude toward condom use with main partners, and condom use with main and nonmain partners. The interaction effects revealed that high, compared to low, self-efficacy motivated more condom use with main and nonmain partners when perceived susceptibility was lower.

T1  - Does communicating disappointment in negotiations help or hurt? Solving an apparent inconsistency in the social-functional approach to emotions
AN  - 1494300604; 201401906
AB  - On the basis of a social-functional approach to emotion, scholars have argued that expressing disappointment in negotiations communicates weakness, which may evoke exploitation. Yet, it is also argued that communicating disappointment serves as a call for help, which may elicit generous offers. Our goal was to resolve this apparent inconsistency. We develop the argument that communicating disappointment elicits generous offers when it evokes guilt in the target, but elicits low offers when it does not. In 4 experiments using both verbal (Experiments 1-3) and nonverbal (Experiment 4) emotion manipulations, we demonstrate that the interpersonal effects of disappointment depend on (a) the opponent's group membership and (b) the type of negotiation. When the expresser was an outgroup member and in representative negotiations (i.e., when disappointment did not evoke guilt), the weakness that disappointment communicated elicited lower offers. When the expresser was an ingroup member and in individual negotiations (i.e., when disappointment did evoke guilt), the weakness that disappointment communicated elicited generous offers from participants. Thus, in contrast to the common belief that weakness is a liability in negotiations, expressing disappointment can be effective under particular circumstances. We discuss implications for theorizing about the social functions of emotions. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Own Group Oppression, Other Group Oppression, and Perspective Taking
AN  - 1680154081; 201514106
AB  - This survey research examined the relationship of awareness of own versus awareness of other group oppression across sexism, racism, and homonegativity, by including perspective taking (PT) as a moderator. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that awareness of sexism (own group oppression) predicted awareness of racism (other group oppression) in a sample of 116 European American females (Study 1), whereas awareness of racism (own group oppression) did not predict awareness of homonegativity (other group oppression) in a sample of 113 U.S. racial minorities (Study 2). High PT, compared to low PT, did not predict a stronger relationship between awareness of own and awareness of other group oppression. Post-hoc speculation on the role of PT in intergroup relations and implications for research and counseling are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Contingent Effect of Race in Juvenile Court Detention Decisions: The Role of Racial and Symbolic Threat
AN  - 1728661383; 201535669
AB  - Race and racial stereotypes have long been recognized as influencing the formal social control of youth. Recent analyses have moved beyond identifying disproportionate minority contact (DMC) and toward assessing the contingencies under which race has a lesser or greater impact on juvenile court outcomes. While often confounded, the racial threat and symbolic threat perspectives offer conceptually distinct explanations for DMC. The racial threat perspective proposes that racial disparities in sanctioning are at least partly the result of perceptions among Whites that the minority group threatens their economic and political hegemony. Alternatively, the symbolic threat perspective proposes that intergroup inequality fosters perceptions that minorities are a threat to middle class norms, values, and standards motivating Whites to discriminate. The current study employs hierarchical generalized linear modeling to discern the salience of these two perspectives to understanding racial bias in preadjudication detention. To do this, we merge county-level Census data with data on nearly a decade's worth of delinquency cases in one Southeastern state. Our results offer limited support for the racial threat perspective but strongly support the symbolic threat perspective in indicating that the impact of race on detention is contingent upon interracial socioeconomic inequality in the community at large.

T1  - The social geography of ethnic minorities in metropolitan Paris: a challenge to the French model of social cohesion?
AN  - 1448992881; 201342789
AB  - In order to address the specific social challenges of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the poorest urban neighbourhoods in Paris, new policies of social cohesion have been implemented over the past three decades that focus on place of residence rather than on ethnicity or national origin. The design of a social cohesion policy that deals with socio-geographic inequality rather than with ethnicized populations as such has been a subtle way of addressing the ethnic issue without directly calling into question the postulate of republican universalism. From this perspective, Audebert attempts to understand the role of place and social geography in the formalization of collective identities that have emerged in response to decades of public policies that have been unable to respond to the social, economic and political demands of ethnic minorities. He also attempts to analyse how the French state has relied on social geography as a way to address racial and ethnic issues without directly endowing them with an institutionalized dimension. His hypothesis is that the issue of social cohesion in contemporary France and the way it is dealt with by republican institutions is above all a matter of social geography. The French approach that gives prominence to the urban territorialization of social inequalities over the ethnic categorization approach remains firmly based on republican ideals. Nonetheless, such a policy is innovative in the French context, as it differs from the French traditional assimilationist model and takes into account social and cultural diversity in large metropolitan areas. Audebert's article provides a better understanding of the influence of this integration model on the construction of Otherness. It puts into relief the role of urban geography in the emergence of ethnicity and the design of innovative policy that addresses the issue of cultural diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Two Signatures of Implicit Intergroup Attitudes: Developmental Invariance and Early Enculturation
AN  - 1463012637; 201345659
AB  - Long traditions in the social sciences have emphasized the gradual internalization of intergroup attitudes and the putatively more basic tendency to prefer the groups to which one belongs. In four experiments (N = 883) spanning two cultures and two status groups within one of those cultures, we obtained new evidence that implicit intergroup attitudes emerge in young children in a form indistinguishable from adult attitudes. Strikingly, this invariance from childhood to adulthood holds for members of socially dominant majorities, who consistently favor their in-group, as well as for members of a disadvantaged minority, who, from the early moments of race-based categorization, do not show a preference for their in-group. Far from requiring a protracted period of internalization, implicit intergroup attitudes are characterized by early enculturation and developmental invariance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predictors of Collective Guilt after the Violent Conflict
AN  - 1417523563; 201335027
AB  - After a violent conflict many post-conflict communities remain ethnically divided and normalization of the inter-group relations is hindered not only by in-group norms and interpretation of past events, but also by collective guilt. Although collective guilt has proved to be an important indicator of post-conflict social repair, more research is needed to define its predictors. This study, conducted in an ethnically divided community, confirmed that collective guilt acceptance and collective guilt assignment in our sample are typical for the post-conflict pattern of intergroup relations -- people readily assign guilt to the outgroup but are unwilling to accept the guilt of their in-group. This suggests that the process of community social reconstruction has not considerably progressed. Our findings also suggest that the two aspects of collective guilt -- assignment and acceptance -- are predicted by similar sets of variables. Both collective guilt assignment and collective guilt acceptance are influenced by identification with in-group which influence is fully or partially mediated with the justification of the in-group's wrongdoings. This indicates that in the post-conflict setting relationship towards the in-group may be more important for experiencing collective guilt than the relationship towards the out-group. Relationship towards out-group, although not crucial, also plays a role in experiencing collective guilt. Specifically, both affect towards and cognitions about out-group members predict collective guilt assignment (with cognition being stronger predictor than positive affect), whereas only (absence of) positive affect predicts acceptance of collective guilt and the cognitive aspect is not predictive.

T1  - Diagnosing Discrimination: Stress from Perceived Racism and the Mental and Physical Health Effects
AN  - 1347782597; 201318647
AB  - Differences in health between racial groups in the United States are significant and persistent. Many studies have documented these differences as a result of a variety of different social factors. An emerging emphasis is the impact of racism in its various forms on physical and mental health. Social stress theory conceptualizes racism as a social stresssor which can produce negative health consequences for racial minorities. This study uses binary logit and negative binomial regression models of four items from the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to test social stress theory and examine the relationship between stress symptoms from perceived racism and overall health (N=32,585). The effect of race on the experience of emotional and physical stress symptoms from racism is substantial. Furthermore, experiencing both emotional and physical stress from perceived racist treatment is an important factor in predicting the number of poor mental and physical health days, indicating that the experience of stress from perceived racism is related to overall poorer health.

T1  - Bending without breaking the mould: race and political representation in the United Kingdom
AN  - 1322723532; 201310831
AB  - Saggar draws together research evidence and practitioner insights to evaluate and interpret change in race and political representation in Britain. The starting point is to ask: how far have British democratic institutions been responsive to the emergence of an ethnically diverse society? There have been significant impacts of such diversity on attitudinal change, demographic and electoral composition and political participation. Saggar's article proceeds in four parts. First, the issue of the political integration of ethnic minorities is discussed, including theoretical debates about political difference in outlook and in behaviour across and within ethnic groups, as well as the ways this may be connected to ethnic background. Second, key normative and empirical arguments are examined about why political change and ethnic pluralism matters, and to whom. The structure, institutions and processes that shape representative outcomes form the backdrop to the remainder of the article. The third section highlights aspects of the party and electoral landscape that disproportionately influence the electoral prospects for discrete minorities. Finally, attention is given to the rise of a 'political class' and discusses how these filters can skew the opportunities available to minorities. Saggar concludes with a discussion of long-term political integration, the emerging focus on executive appointments, and how, through political integration and social cohesion, minorities can affect the wider political system they have joined.

Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cultural Division Among Diasporic Nigerians: A Systemic Dilemma
AN  - 1429629517; 201335749
AB  - In my childhood, it was quite noticeable that distinctions between Yoruba, Edo, Ibo, and Hausa were minimal. At independence in the early 1960's, Nigeria's population stood at fifty-six million, compared to about 152 million today. Between 1960 and 2008, Nigeria, a multi-ethnic and multireligious nation with considerable development potential, fell into the ethnic clashes over distribution of scarce resources among competitive interest groups. Nigeria cultural divisions are very complicated phenomena. This essay reviews the degree of normlessness, alienation, powerlessness and cultural estrangement among diasporic Nigerians and how social dynamics, such as differentiated ideology and social distance, have affected the participation of ethnic minorities within their Nigerian counterparts. In addition, to a great extent, the cultural division faced by the diasporic Nigerians gradually increased bias among ethnic groups often against their own group interest.

T1  - To share or divide power? Minorities in autonomous regions, the case of the autonomous region in Muslim Mindanao
AN  - 1567049160; 201435110
AB  - Autonomy granted to minority groups as a form of power-sharing may not necessarily address the representation and welfare needs of the smaller minorities within the autonomous government. Although numerically insignificant, the smaller minorities' disempowerment and discrimination can lead to these groups' further marginalization and weaken the democratic viability and legitimacy of the autonomy project. What institutional mechanisms would work best for minorities-within-minorities in an autonomous region? Should similar power-sharing or consociational arrangements be replicated within the region? Or, are power-dividing measures and the integrative approach more appropriate for regional stability and democratic governance? Analyzing the institutional design of and practices in the Philippines' Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, this paper concludes that a combination of power-sharing and power-dividing measures are needed to address the gaps in representation and protection of welfare of all ethnic groups for both the short- and long-term viability of regional autonomy.

T1  - (Re)scaling identities: Embodied others and alternative spaces of identification
AN  - 1448996396; 201342868
AB  - This article draws attention to life as an 'internal stranger' in the city, the nation and other spatial formations. It explores the habitability of the different spatial formations and the possibilities of identification for ethnic minority groups. Drawing on research on citizens in Copenhagen of Pakistani origin, the study employs theoretical ideas of estrangement, identification and recognition in order to obtain a thorough understanding of the complexity and the contradictory character of their spatial identities and affiliations. A turning point in the double processes of estrangement and identification is ambivalence in affiliation to the Danish nation expressing the discrepancy between feeling Danish and not being recognized as a full member of the Danish imagined community. This emotional ambivalence gives rise to what we call jumping scale in identification and a search for alternative spaces of identity.

T1  - Information flow and influence in collective choice
AN  - 1315601576; 201307345
AB  - If decision-relevant information is distributed among team members, the group is inclined to focus on common information and to neglect unique information. This classical finding is robust in experimental settings, in which the distribution of information is created by experimental design. The current paper examines information sharing when access to information is not restricted. We analyzed archival search and discussion data obtained from business executives completing a personnel selection exercise. Information popularity in the population from which groups were composed predicted both the number of group members accessing items during information searches and whether the group discussed the items. The number of group members who accessed an item predicted whether information was repeated during discussion, and repetition predicted which items were included on an executive summary. Moreover, cognitively central group members were more influential than cognitively peripheral members. One implication is that collective information search and discussion highlights information that is perceived as relevant in the population from which groups are composed.

T1  - Intergroup Relations among the Ethiopian Youth: Effects of Ethnicity, Language, and Religious Background
AN  - 1221408905; 201244154
AB  - This study examines the level of intergroup relations among Ethiopian university students coming from ethnically and religiously diverse backgrounds. The article conceptualized intergroup contact in terms of students' cross-group friendship. It investigates the extent to which intergroup contact is affected by attitude towards other ethnic (IEA) and religious (IRA) groups, their perceived cross-ethnic cohesiveness (CEC), ethnic-orientation, and patriotism. Data were gathered based on a survey of 188 students drawn from one of Ethiopia's public higher education institutions. The findings reveal that the majority of the students showed favorable attitude towards other ethno-cultural and religious groups, and attitude towards other ethnic groups (IEA) is found to be independent of one's ethnic background. Nevertheless, while cross-ethnic friendship is negatively affected by language difficulties, failure to make friends from religious out-group is associated with strong conformity with the teachings of the respective religions. Finally, the article forwards policy recommendations for increased intercultural understanding and improved intergroup relations.

T1  - Not all prejudices are experienced equally: Comparing experiences of racism and sexism in female minorities
AN  - 1023028898; 201223700
AB  - Research exploring the perspectives of stigmatized people has examined general processes related to experiencing prejudice. Past work, however, has invoked the assumption that prejudices against different group memberships are experienced in a similar manner. Across three studies we directly compare experiences of racism and sexism among female minorities and show, in contrast, that people respond to different forms of prejudice in distinct ways. In Study 1 we examined the attributions invoked by Asian women to explain prejudice and discovered that participants made stronger internal attributions to explain racism than sexism. In Study 2 we investigated emotional reactions to prejudice and found that Asian women report experiencing more depression following a race-based rejection than a gender-based rejection. In Study 3 we observed that Asian women reported perceiving more racism than sexism in their environments. Implications for advancing theories of prejudice experiences are discussed.

AB  - This article investigates the operations of minority schools, and the subsequent on-the-ground experiences of ethnic minorities in Beijing at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels. The article suggests that the 'inter-sectionality' of ethnic identities, particularly minority-majority, rich-poor and urban-rural, must be factored in when examining the varying differences between minorities who have graduated from Beijing's minority schools and non-Beijing ethnic minorities, who have enrolled in the capital city's universities. The article draws upon recent statistical data, interviews with minority actors and public stakeholders, and participant observation in the city's schools and universities.

T1  - Internet use and online social support among same sex attracted individuals of different ages
AN  - 907925389; 201124624
AB  - The current research addressed age differences in internet use among Same Sex Attracted (SSA) individuals. In general, online communities are found to be a source of social support, especially for minority group members. However, it is unclear whether younger and older SSA people differ in their use of these communities. The present research examined age differences in use of online communities, hypothesizing that young SSA people primarily use these for social interaction and support, whereas older SSA people use online communities to seek sexual contacts. Study 1 examined age differences in motives to start using these websites. Study 2 examined age differences in use of online profiles and online social support. Results of both studies confirmed our hypotheses. Younger compared to older SSA people are found to receive more online social support, whereas older SSA use the internet more for sexual purposes. Our findings provide first time evidence of the relation between sexual orientation, age and internet use. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among young Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch
AN  - 919903140; 201201748
AB  - Background: This study examines the associations between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents and young adults living in the Netherlands. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional data from a sample of 199 Turkish-Dutch and 153 Moroccan-Dutch respondents, aged 15-24 years, using multiple logistic regression analyses. Discrimination was measured on group level and personal level. Depression was measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: Respondents that experienced perceived discrimination on a personal level were more likely than those that experienced no perceived discrimination to have depression (OR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.59-6.47). This association was larger for the Moroccan-Dutch (OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 1.75-16.16) compared with the Turkish-Dutch (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.03-7.40). Analysis of separate group level discrimination items, measuring different domains, revealed an association between discrimination on school and depression for the Moroccan-Dutch (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.16-6.78). Conclusion: Personal level perceived discrimination is associated with depressive symptoms among young minority group members with a Turkish or Moroccan cultural background. This indicates that discrimination is an important factor that should be taken into account in developing public health policies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rethinking state-ethnic minority relations in Laos: Internal resettlement, land reform and counter-territorialization
AN  - 1037879114; 201231115
AB  - Democratic participation and the political weight of ethnic minorities have generally increased across Southeast Asia. Indigenous movements, alliances with nongovernmental organizations and legal challenges have become important instruments for laying claims on customary resources and influencing or countering state territorialization. While such strategies are generally not feasible in one-party states such as the Lao People's Democratic Republic, minorities may also engage in more subtle and covert forms of counter-territorialization. This paper provides a detailed account of local responses to internal resettlement and land reform in two minority villages of northern Laos. Drawing upon Michel Foucault's description of governmentality, it discusses the functioning of state-ethnic minority relations and argues for a critical yet nuanced perspective on the agency of ethnic minorities vis-a-vis state territorialization.

T1  - Through whose eyes? The impact of identification on judgments of group status: GPIR
AN  - 1910239632
AB  - This paper examines how group identification influences individuals' judgments of the in-group's status. Across four studies, using multiple manipulations of identification and measurements of group status, we demonstrate that increased identification with one's group positively influences judgments of the in-group's status. Moreover, we find confirmatory support for our prediction that this relationship is mediated by collective self-esteem. Implications of this research for social identity theory and both intragroup and intergroup status perceptions are discussed.

T1  - Daily Encounters Between Hans and Uyghurs in Xinjiang: Sinicization, Integration or Segregation?
AN  - 887499780; 201118086
AB  - In September 2009, the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China claimed that Xinjiang benefits from respect and harmony between the ethnic groups. This rhetoric is faithfully propagated by national media: they uniformly praise the unity amongst the Han and Uyghurs through the common slogans of minzu tuanjie (ethnic unity) and hexie guanxi (harmonious relations). Going beyond the official documents and propaganda, my purpose is to explore the relations between these two ethnic groups. I will focus on the ideas, words and actions of Han and Uyghur young people living in Urumqi who are often under-represented in official sources, or other forms of written and scholarly discourse. While comparing their behaviour, I argue that ethnic disharmony between Hans and Uyghurs exists, but it is simplistic to blame only the Chinese government or one of the ethnic groups, and naive to ask what China can do to solve the problem. Instead, by exploring what the social agents in the young educated society in Xinjiang truly think of ethnic relations between them and the "other," this paper presents a comprehensive picture of the issue. My ethnographic research interprets how people remember, interpret and sometimes exaggerate their ethnic traditions and cultural practices in daily life in relation to the other ethnic group. The findings demonstrate how young people are determining the course of ethnic relations by constructing movable social barriers that result in segregation between them, raising doubts about the future possibilities for ethnic harmony.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Evaluations of Race-Based Exclusion in Urban Minority Children and Adolescents
AN  - 1037881780; 201233465
AB  - There is a dearth of published research on the role of intergroup contact on urban US ethnic minority children's and adolescents' evaluations of racial exclusion. The current investigation examined these issues in a sample of low-income minority 4th, 7th, and 10th grade (N = 129, 60% female) African American and Latino/a students attending predominately racial and ethnic minority US urban public schools. Using individual interviews, participants were presented with scenarios depicting three contexts of interracial peer exclusion (lunch at school, a sleepover party, and a school dance). Novel findings were that intergroup contact was significantly related to low-income urban ethnic minority youth's evaluations of the wrongfulness of race-based exclusion and their awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion. Further, significant interactions involving intergroup contact, context, age, and gender were also found. Findings illustrated the importance of intergroup contact for ethnic minority students and the complexity of ethnic minority children's and adolescents' judgments and decision-making about interracial peer exclusion.

T1  - Group Identity, Ethnic Separatism and Multiple Out-Groups: The Basque Case
AN  - 856403268; 201106800
AB  - Within the context of the Basque Country in Spain we examined how ethnic (Basque) and national (Spanish) identification relate to the evaluation of Spaniards, Basques, Andalusians and Catalans. On a sample of adolescent participants we tested a structural equation model which considered identity content (Basque separatism) as a mediator of the relationship between group identifications and group evaluations. While Spanish and Basque identification were associated with a positive evaluation of Spanish and Basque in-groups, respectively, the evaluation of out-groups that are relatively similar to the in-group were not affected by identification. In contrast, dissimilar out-groups tended to be evaluated more negatively by higher in-group identifiers. Basque separatism mediated the negative relationship between Basque identification and the evaluation of Spaniards and of Andalusians as a prototypically Spanish subgroup. It is concluded that identification relates differently to the evaluation of different out-groups, and that the ideological content of identity plays an important role in determining intergroup relations.

T1  - The Ethnic Composition of the Neighbourhood and Ethnic Minorities' Social Contacts: Three Unresolved Issues
AN  - 1018368572; 201212894
AB  - It is frequently supposed that the ethnic composition of a neighbourhood affects ethnic minorities' social contacts with natives, co-ethnics and other ethnic minorities. Research to date, however, falls short in several ways. First of all, previous studies often did not consider social contacts with co-ethnics and other ethnic minorities. Second, although different mechanisms (i.e. meeting opportunities, ethnic competition theory, 'third parties' and constrict theory) point to different dimensions of the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood (the percentage of ethnic minorities, the percentage of co-ethnics, and ethnic diversity), there is a lack of research that systematically studies these different dimensions of the ethnic composition of the neighbourhood in relation to ethnic minorities' social contacts. Third, other relevant neighbourhood characteristics (economic disadvantage and residential mobility) are often neglected. The present study sought to address these three unresolved issues. Results of multivariate multilevel analyses of survey data on ethnic minorities in the Netherlands (N = 4,216) show that both the percentage of ethnic minorities and the degree of ethnic diversity relate to less contact with natives, but more contact with co-ethnics and other ethnic minorities. The percentage of co-ethnics is only related to more contact with co-ethnics. Results and policy implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudice: rethinking geographies of oppression
AN  - 758129750; 201059867
AB  - Despite equal opportunities legislation in many western societies, overt prejudice against minority groups is still evident. Yet, despite the persistence of equality issues, 'prejudice' is a term that is not widely employed in geography because of its association with a particular history of meaning within social psychology. In this paper I explore the concept of prejudice and its relationship to geographical research on discrimination and oppression. Then using original empirical research in three communities I examine how prejudice is justified and articulated by majority people. In doing so, I explore the complex intersectionalities of negative attitudes towards specific minority groups and the ways that specific mechanisms of sub-ordination can reinforce and support one another.

T1  - Group Devaluation and Group Identification
AN  - 758122044; 201056998
AB  - In three studies, we showed that increased in-group identification after (perceived or actual) group devaluation is an assertion of a (preexisting) positive social identity that counters the negative social identity implied in societal devaluation. Two studies with real-world groups used order manipulations to show that the (perceived or actual) devaluation of an in-group led individuals to increase their identification with this in-group. Group devaluation most strongly and consistently increased individuals' satisfaction, rather than solidarity, centrality, or the other components of Leach et al.'s (2008) measure of identification. A third study showed that giving Black Britons the opportunity to identify with this in-group immediately after evidence of its societal devaluation reduced feelings of vulnerability (but not rejection). Although there was consistent evidence of the (perceived or actual) group devaluation ^1 group identification link, the group identification ^1 (perceived) group devaluation link was much stronger. Implications for theory and research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sport events and ethnic reconciliation: Attempting to create social change between Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim sportspeople in war-torn Sri Lanka
AN  - 754045510; 201054214
AB  - Reconciliation is about bringing disparate communities together and creating the communication necessary to reduce intergroup barriers, generate understanding, and connect with others to achieve a peaceful togetherness. This article investigates the role of sport events in contributing to reconciliation and inclusive social change between disparate communities in ethnically divided Sri Lanka. Following an interpretive mode of enquiry, findings suggest that if strategically designed, sport events allow the establishment of interpersonal friendships and the creation of inclusive social identities along national lines, organizational lines, common interests and imagined factors. Events can create 'momenta of togetherness' for members of disparate ethnic groups and as such may contribute to positive social change and a sense of imagiNation. While sport events provide a starting point, booster and catalyst for positive social change and development on a community level, they need to be integrated into a larger agenda of socio-political support to make a significant contribution to reconciliation and peace in divided societies.

T1  - Being "In" With the In-Crowd: The Effects of Social Exclusion and Inclusion Are Enhanced by the Perceived Essentialism of Ingroups and Outgroups
AN  - 1928322917
AB  - Social belonging is an essential human need. Belonging to social groups serves an important role in shaping our social identities. Nonetheless, research indicates that exclusion by ingroup and outgroup members seems equally aversive. The current studies test the hypothesis that unlike more trivial groups (e.g., smoking or computer preferences), highly essentialized groups may lead to differential effects of ingroup versus outgroup rejection. Consistent with this, exclusion and inclusion by racial ingroup members (relative to racial outgroup members) exacerbated the sting of rejection and the glow of inclusion (Study 1). In a second study, direct manipulations of essentialist beliefs about ingroups and outgroups (i.e., political affiliations) led to the same results. These results offer a novel demonstration that essentialized ingroup--outgroup distinctions enhance the sting of social exclusion and the positivity of social inclusion.

T1  - 'Where the Danger Lies': Race, Gender, and Chinese and Japanese Exclusion in the United States, 1870--1924
AN  - 743067166; 201043300
AB  - Race too often is used as the explanatory variable for understanding immigration exclusion, marginalizing the significance of race making, ethnic differentiation, and gender construction in particular. This article explores these processes by examining exclusionary policies implemented against Chinese and Japanese immigrants from the mid-1870s to 1924, the year the National Origins Act was passed. Politicians, intellectuals, and moral reformers used a gendered logic--the construction of idealized gender norms, roles, and sexual propriety and the attachment of these meanings to male and female bodies--to distinguish Japanese immigrants from the Chinese immigrants they followed, allowing for ethnic differentiation and dissimilar policies. The convergence toward exclusion rested on a racialized logic--the construction and attachment of inferior status and meanings to immigrant groups through discourse, formal and informal categorization, or social closure--which claimed that the Japanese were unassimilable and racially undesirable like the Chinese. Exclusionists focused on the immigrant women, decrying their sexual and gender impropriety as evidence of the groups' threats to the sanctity of white families, which imperiled the nation. Gender and race both mattered in these logics and their meanings were constructed as their salience interconnected. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Editorial introduction: Young people, social capital and ethnic identity
AN  - 743066658; 201043341
AB  - British empirical analyses investigating the relationship between ethnicity and social capital tend to highlight the views and experiences of adult minority ethnic individuals. In contrast the experiences of young people remain an under developed, but growing, research area. Our interest in this special issue stems from the desire to promote young people's voices in public and policy debates, particularly those from minority ethnic groups and communities, and to bring to the fore their experiences. Drawing on empirical research conducted in the Caribbean, England, Finland, Italy and Northern Ireland, the collection of articles explores the social capital of young people across diverse ethnic and cultural settings. We draw on theories of ethnicity and social capital to explore the ways in which they might be utilised as social resources by young people. We consider how ethnicity and cultural belonging might be regarded as both positive and negative forms of social capital among young people. We also critically reflect on ideas about social capital and ethnicity to assess the extent to which new forms of identities, networks and participation are emerging in the real life contexts of young people belonging to cultural and ethnic minority communities.

T1  - Patterns of cross-orientation friendships in high schools
AN  - 743043227; 201029457
AB  - Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

T1  - Perceived Entitativity and the Black-Sheep Effect: When Will We Denigrate Negative Ingroup Members?
AN  - 743045285; 201026391
AB  - Although ingroup favoritism is a robust effect, there are notable exceptions. For example, the outgroup extremity effect indicates outgroup derogation, whereas the black-sheep effect indicates ingroup derogation. We propose that perceived entitativity, the degree to which a group is viewed as a unified social entity, may help explain ingroup derogation. Negative ingroup members from high perceived entitativity groups may pose a meaningful threat to the perceiver's social identity that can be alleviated by denigrating the target (i.e., the black-sheep effect). Participants evaluated high or low quality essays attributed to ingroup & outgroup members. Participants did not differentiate based on ingroup/outgroup membership for low perceived entitativity groups. However, when rating high perceived entitativity groups, ingroup extremity emerged. These results confirm & provide explanations for ingroup denigration. Adapted from the source document.
