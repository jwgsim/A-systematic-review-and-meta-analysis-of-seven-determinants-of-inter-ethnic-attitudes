T1  - Immigration, Identity, and Anonymity: Intentionally Masked Intolerance in Ireland: IMR
AN  - 2685962023
AB  - Newcomers to Ireland confront a context of reception shaped by large-scale historical emigration and more recent immigration defined by an increasingly diverse set of origin contexts, both within and outside the European Union (EU). How has the Irish population responded to these groups, and how openly do Irish residents express their views toward different immigrant groups? We test this response using a survey experiment, which offered respondents an anonymous way to express any negative attitudes to immigrant groups they may have had. Results from the survey experiment show that Irish residents’ support for Black and Polish immigrations is overstated when expressed directly. In contrast, their sentiment toward Muslim immigrants is notably insensitive to the level of anonymity provided, indicating little difference between overt and covert expression of support (or antipathy). In other words, when race/ethnicity or EU origin is made salient, Irish respondents are more likely to mask negative sentiment. When Islam is emphasized, however, Irish antipathy is not masked. We find that in-group preferences, instead of determining support in an absolute sense, shape the reluctance with which opposition to immigrant groups is overtly expressed.

T1  - ‘In your own head everyone is staring’: the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy
AN  - 2624032272
AB  - This article explores the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Using a narrative inquiry methodology, 25 young people between 18 and 29 years participated in in-depth interviews. Their narratives highlighted growing perceptions of difference and how the negative actions and attitudes of a few people in their past continued to shadow their current lives. Influenced by perceived negative attitudes of others to disability and their own internalisation of these, the young people conceptualise a binary of normalcy and difference, finding themselves liminally positioned, somewhere in between, and mostly seeking to avoid a disability association. In new social situations, the young people reported engaging in disability identity management work, while often resisting having disability as part of their identity. These can be conceptualised as acts of resilience and of resistance in the face of oppressive social forces. There is a powerful counter narrative in a sub group of the participants who were actively engaged with peers with experience of disability. For these young people, the inclusion of disability within social identities became possible. The findings of this study have implications for our understandings of managing identities in young lives, particularly for those in marginal positions.

T1  - Integrating Canadian Youth: The State of Intergroup Contact, Belonging, and Support for Immigration
AN  - 2620026518
AB  - This paper reports the results of a survey examining 168 immigrant and non-immigrant youth's perspectives of intergroup relations, support for immigration, and feelings of belonging in Canada. Using Allport's (1954) contact theory and the multiculturalism hypothesis (Berry et al., 2021) as a framework, the data is analyzed in the context of relative levels of intergroup contact, friendship, immigration-related knowledgeability, and perceived diversity. This study finds that, overall, the Canadian youth surveyed were more supportive of immigration than older generations and reported high levels of intergroup positivity and frequent intergroup contact. Moreover, intergroup contact and intergroup friendships were positively associated with feelings of belonging, whereas support for immigration was associated with immigration-related knowledgeability and perceptions of diversity.

T1  - The Effects of Populist Identity Framing on Populist Attitudes Across Europe: Evidence From a 15-Country Comparative Experiment
AN  - 2631533223
AB  - We investigate the effects of populist messages that (a) stress the centrality of “ordinary” people, (b) shift blame to the “corrupt” elites, or (c) combine people centrality and antielitist cues on 3 dimensions of populist attitudes: anti-elitism, homogeneous people, and popular sovereignty. We conducted an extensive 15-country experiment in which we manipulated populist communication as social identity frames (N = 7,271). Multilevel analyses demonstrate that messages stressing the centrality of the ordinary people activate all dimensions of populist attitudes. In contrast, anti-elite messages activate anti-elitism attitudes only for those individuals with lower levels of education and extreme positions on the ideological left–right spectrum. Our findings suggest that populist political communication plays a key role in activating populist attitudes across Europe.

T1  - Ambivalent Effects of Positive Contact Between Women and Men on Collective Actions for Women’s Rights
AN  - 2556958989
AB  - Positive intergroup contact, under some conditions, can undermine the interest of members of both socially disadvantaged and advantaged groups to act for equality. However, little is known about whether similar effects appear in a unique form of intergroup relations, gender relations. In two correlational studies and two experiments, we investigated the relationships among quality of contact, perceived discrimination, fusion with the feminist movement, and willingness to engage in collective action for women’s rights. For women (Study 1a), positive contact with men was associated with less perceived discrimination, less fusion, and less collective action. For men (Study 1b), the relationships were in the opposite direction. Studies 2a and 2b revealed that recalling experiences of gender discrimination nullified the effects of contact for both women and men as compared to a control condition. Thus, when discrimination is not explicitly recognized, positive contact might have sedative effects on women, but mobilizing effects on men.

T1  - Enfranchising immigrants and/or emigrants? Attitudes towards voting rights expansion among sedentary nationals in Europe
AN  - 2549028155
AB  - Normative debates and comparative studies on voting rights regulations are lively. However, little is known on what citizens think of enfranchising migrants. This paper starts to fill this gap. We conducted an original survey in 26 European countries (n = 16,555). In most countries, an (often narrow) majority of sedentary nationals supports enfranchising emigrants. In all countries, no majority favours the enfranchisement of immigrants, although falling short of a majority in several cases. Being a woman, a bi-national citizen, but also younger, and leaning to the political left is associated with higher support for enfranchising immigrants. However, no individual-level characteristics, apart from age, is associated with the support for enfranchising emigrants. An exclusive national identity is associated not only with lower support for enfranchising immigrants but for emigrants, as well. Furthermore, larger relative sizes of immigrant population fuel support for enfranchisement of this group.

T1  - Moderators of intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups: A comprehensive test of predictions from system justification theory
AN  - 2546134409
AB  - We examined hypotheses proposed by System Justification Theory (SJT; Jost, Banaji, & Nosek, 2004) regarding intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups, using large samples of online participants (total N = 715,721), spanning 8 intergroup domains and 14 nations. Using a meta-analytic approach, we tested these hypotheses at the individual level (as SJT is generally articulated), as well as at the social group level. Consistent with SJT, individual-level analyses revealed that disadvantaged groups demonstrated outgroup favoritism on Implicit Association Tests (IATs; i.e., implicit measures), but demonstrated ingroup favoritism or no intergroup preference on self-report (i.e., explicit) measures. Additionally, these average effects were characterized by high heterogeneity, and follow-up exploratory analyses revealed that intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups was moderated by the intergroup domain: Whereas some disadvantaged groups consistently displayed outgroup favoritism (e.g., age, weight), others consistently displayed ingroup favoritism (e.g., sexual orientation, religion), and yet others displayed diverging patterns on implicit and explicit measures (e.g., race, ethnicity). Consistent with SJT, intergroup evaluation on all measures was moderated by self-reported conservatism. Furthermore, the magnitude of these relationships depended on the level of analysis, with small effects emerging at the individual level and medium-sized effects emerging at the social group level. Social group-level analyses also indicated that intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups was moderated by stigma. Overall, these findings support and extend the predictions of SJT, but the relatively complex patterns of intergroup evaluation in disadvantaged groups identified here illustrate a need for further theory development and more theory-driven research in this domain.

T1  - Meta-humanization reduces prejudice, even under high intergroup threat
AN  - 2507170702
AB  - Meta-dehumanization, the perception your group has been given less than human qualities, contributes to a vicious cycle of outgroup dehumanization and hostility, such as hate crimes and support for discriminatory policies. Minimal research has investigated potential benefits of meta-humanization, or perceiving your group has been given dignified qualities. Across 7 studies (N = 1,261) in Canada and the United Kingdom, we focus on Muslim–non-Muslim relations and provide the first empirical evidence to suggest that (a) there is an indirect effect of meta-humanization through outgroup humanization that reduces prejudice and (b) that perceived high intergroup threat moderates the indirect effect of meta-humanization. Studies 1a and 1b reveal that humanization mediates the indirect effect of meta-humanization on prejudice. Studies 2a and 2b replicate these results as well as demonstrate that perceived threat moderates the indirect effect, and Study 2c extends this by testing the perspective of Muslims. Studies 3a and 3b further demonstrate an interaction between high threat and meta-humanization on prejudice and interest in intergroup contact. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the growing literature on meta-dehumanization, meta-humanization, and intergroup relations more broadly.

T1  - Local labour market competition and radical right voting: Evidence from France
AN  - 2448280781
AB  - How do the economic effects of immigration affect radical right support? The evidence in support of the labour market competition theory — which posits that the economic threat posed by immigration to jobs and wages leads to radical right voting — has been mixed. On the one hand, individual‐level surveys underreport economic drivers because of social desirability bias. On the other hand, contextual studies show contradictory findings due to an over‐reliance on units of analysis that are too aggregated to meaningfully capture the competitive threat posed by immigrants. This paper identifies the influence of labour market competition on radical right voting at a local level in contexts where native workers are directly affected by the arrival of immigrants who have similar or higher skillsets. Using an original longitudinal dataset of fine‐grained municipal electoral, demographic and economic data from France over the 2002–2017 period, the paper provides empirical evidence of local contextual influences of economic competition between natives and immigrants of any skillset. Under local conditions of material deprivation, measured by the local unemployment rate, the effect of labour market competition on municipalities’ radical right vote share is amplified. Moreover, higher radical right support is observed in municipalities with a higher share of any one of the following groups: low‐skilled natives, medium‐skilled immigrants or high‐skilled immigrants. This supports the hypothesis that immigrants with higher qualifications are compelled to accept lower‐skilled jobs, and are thus perceived as a competitive threat to low‐skilled natives. By reconciling radical right contextual studies and research on the political economy of immigration policies, this paper highlights the importance of a local analysis in detecting the effect of labour market competition on radical right support. This paper also explains why some local areas are more prone to radical right support than others over time.

T1  - Applying Sociological Theories of Emotions to the Study of Mass Politics: The Rally-Round-the-Flag Phenomenon in the United States as a Test Case
AN  - 2558592062
AB  - A remarkable progress has been made in integrating emotions into studies of various aspects of social life, but sociological theories of emotions, which center on group membership and meaning-making, have not been applied to the study of political attitudes and behavior. In order to demonstrate the utility of integrating sociological theories of emotions into the analysis of large-scale political phenomena, this study revisits the rally-round-the-flag effect (i.e., sudden increases in public support for national leaders during war or security crisis). The article claims that rallies are driven by emotional reactions to leaders’ rhetoric promising to restore the nation’s collective honor and status through military action. Analysis of survey data collected during and between two rally periods (2001–2003) in the United States supports this argument vis-à-vis competing theories of attitude formation that ignore the role of emotions or apply a non-sociological framework that detaches emotions from collective identities and meaning-making.

T1  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities: A meta‐cognitive approach to persuasion
AN  - 2398196181
AB  - Attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities are becoming critical for promoting diversity and egalitarianism within organizations. The few interventions designed to promote positive attitudes toward people with disabilities have relied on changing either the direction and/or the amount of thoughts people generate with regard to this discriminated, understudied group. In the present research, we examine the impact of a different psychological process of attitude change based on meta‐cognition, or thinking about thinking. We used a meta‐cognitive approach to changing prejudiced attitudes because thoughtful processes are often overlooked or denied with regard to this particular group. Specifically, we explored the impact of thought confidence on attitude change across two studies designed to change attitudes toward the incorporation of people with disabilities in companies. In each study, participants first generated either positive or negative thoughts about the proposal (thought valence manipulation). Then, the confidence in those thoughts was measured (Study 1) or manipulated (Study 2). In concert with the self‐validation hypothesis, results showed that when thought confidence was relatively high (vs. low), thought valence had a greater impact on attitudes. Thus, thought valence was more predictive of attitudes when participants were confident in their thoughts. Specifically, confidence in thoughts enhanced persuasion for positive thoughts but reduced persuasion for negative thoughts. These findings provide insights into assessing effects of interventions aiming at improving attitudes toward the inclusion of minority groups in organizations.

This study examines how prejudice and realistic threat impact White Americans’ attitudes toward accepting refugees and immigrants in general. Using data from the 2016 American National Election Study and the 2016 Chicago Council Survey, I show that even though refugees differ from other immigrants in terms of their legal status and the rhetoric pertaining to them, attitudes toward immigration policies relating to both refugees and immigrants in general are primarily driven by prejudice.

T1  - Difference and punishment: Ethno-political exclusion, colonial institutional legacies, and incarceration
AN  - 2331598526
AB  - One dominant theoretical explanation for higher incarceration rates across the world focuses on how a nation’s level of diversity or minority presence broadly writ unleashes racial resentment that can lead to incarceration. This article contends that population heterogeneity alone offers an incomplete picture of how ethnic-based tension can affect incarceration rates. Rather, we argue that majority ethnic groups around the world use prison systems in order to govern and manage minority populations, especially those systematically excluded from power. In addition, we argue that these political structures have their roots in a nation’s colonial legacy, a legacy that shapes a nation’s contemporary incarceration rates. Results from our quantitative analysis reveal that controlling for competing explanations, there are positive associations between ethnic political exclusion and the length and form of a nation’s colonial experience and rates of incarceration.

T1  - What would you know about it? Managing ingroup vs. outgroup perceived support of same-sex vs. mixed-sex romantic relationships
AN  - 2312419974
AB  - Social support for relationships is an important predictor of relationship well-being, duration, and mental and physical health. But does the source of the support matter? This article examines whether there is potential moderation by the ingroup versus outgroup status of the person offering the support. Specifically, in a sample of 407 individuals in mixed-sex versus same-sex relationships, we assessed how much social support individuals perceived for their relationship from members of their social network who were queer versus straight. Those in same-sex relationships had significantly more queer members within their social networks than those in mixed-sex relationships (38.6% vs. 8.1%). We found that although those in both types of relationships perceived more support for their relationships from ingroup network members, only those in mixed-sex relationships demonstrated a stronger association between ingroup (straight) support and relationship well-being. Those in same-sex relationships showed relatively weak associations between network members' support for the relationship and their relationship well-being, regardless of source. Results are interpreted in light of the social identity perspective, and we also discuss the potential for attributional ambiguity and discounting of others' opinions about their relationships within the context of same-sex relationships.

T1  - Religiosity or racism? The bases of opposition to religious accommodation in Quebec
AN  - 2202918660
AB  - Though Canada is internationally lauded for the success of its multiculturalism policies, debates about immigrant integration have arisen in recent years. These debates have turned on the extent to which religion should be accommodated in the public sphere. They have also been disproportionately concentrated in the French‐speaking province of Quebec. This paper asks whether this disproportionality is due to the Quebec population being particularly unfavourable to religious accommodation and, if so, whether this disfavour is grounded in racial antipathy toward newcomers or in the province's unique religious history. The findings show that while opposition to religious accommodation is higher in Quebec, and higher among francophones, it is rooted more in the low level of religiosity of the francophone population than in racial animus. These results emphasise the importance of correctly conceptualising distinctions between ethnocentric and culturally based sources of group conflict in multicultural settings such as Canada.

T1  - Identity‐centrality, dimensions of uncertainty, and pursuit of subgroup autonomy: The case of Sardinia within Italy
AN  - 2118274308
AB  - Although group‐related uncertainties have been shown to drive subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy, it is unclear whether all group‐related uncertainties motivate subgroup autonomy. We hypothesized that social identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, about one’s subgroup is a key driver of support for subgroup autonomy. We measured Sardinian participants’ (N = 174) relative subgroup (Sardinian) and superordinate group (Italian) identity‐centrality, identity‐uncertainty, and politico‐economic uncertainty to predict support for subgroup autonomy and superordinate group fragmentation. Results showed that subgroup identity‐uncertainty, not politico‐economic uncertainty, elicited stronger support for subgroup autonomy, especially among highly identified subgroup members. Superordinate group fragmentation was predicted by relatively weaker superordinate identity‐centrality. Results suggest that subgroups’ pursuit of autonomy is driven by the hopes of reducing identity‐uncertainty.

T1  - Organs and organisations: Situating ethics in organ donation after circulatory death in the UK
AN  - 2100879305
AB  - Controlled organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) has recently been revived in the UK, as part of attempts to increase organ donation rates. The re-introduction of DCD has subsequently become the focus of bioethical controversy, since it necessitates intervening in the care of dying patients to obtain quality donor organs. Transplant policy responses to these concerns have generated new legal and ethical guidelines to address uncertainties around DCD, producing claims that the UK has overcome’ the ethical challenge of DCD. In contrast, by drawing on Lynch's call to ‘respecify’ ethics, this paper argues that ethics in DCD cannot be reduced to abstract directives for practice, but, instead, are composed and dealt with as an organisational problem. To do this, I utilise data from an ethnographic study examining the production of the ‘minority ethnic organ donor’ within UK organ donation settings; in particular, the data pertains to a case hospital which was in the process of developing a DCD programme during the period of fieldwork. Findings show that the ethics of DCD are encountered as practical sets of problems, constructed in relation to particular institutional locales. I describe how these issues are worked-around by creating conditions to make DCD organisationally possible, and through the animation of standard procedures into acceptable forms of practice. I argue that ethics in DCD go far beyond normative bioethical principles, to encompass concerns around: the reputation of hospital Trusts, public perceptions of organ donation, the welfare of potential donor families, and challenges to the work of health professionals caring for dying patients. The paper enriches understanding of ethics in science and medicine by showing how ethics are assembled and negotiated as a practical-organisational concern, and calls for further examination of how DCD gets constructed as a potential problem and is made to happen in practice.

T1  - Invisible to the state. Institutional sexual stigma and collective action of LGB individuals in five East European countries: GPIR
AN  - 1910840053
AB  - As demonstrated in past research, institutional sexual stigma negativly affects the well-being of nonheteronormative individuals. In this contribution we investigate the effects that heterosexist legal regulations exert on collective action of LGB (lesbian, gay, and bisexual) people. Building on different theoretical traditions, we propose a model linking institutional sexual stigma (a macrolevel phenomenon) to individual behaviour (a microlevel phenomenon). To verify our assumptions we use data from a cross-cultural study (N = 1,365) conducted in five East European countries (i.e., Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland) differing in the extent to which they grant full civil rights to sexual minorities. In line with our hypotheses we find that, by promoting internalized homophobia and subsequently undermining in-group identification, institutional sexual stigma suppresses collective action of LGB individuals. As weak LGB activism impedes social change towards more progressive legislation, a vicious circle is set in motion.

T1  - Searching for Tomorrow--South Sudanese Women Reconstructing Resilience through Photovoice
AN  - 1886222562
AB  - Constricted definitions of resiliency have limited application to refugees who typically negotiate complex interpersonal, intercultural, historical, and geopolitical factors in order to overcome the challenges of flight, exile, forced migration, and resettlement. Researchers were approached by eight South Sudanese refugee women resettled in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, who were interested in exploring alternative notions of resilience through reflection, dialogue, and action. Participatory action research methodology was chosen to co-create knowledge as an alternative to Western-centric resiliency discourse. This approach prioritizes under-represented voices through democratic co-participation, reflecting the lived experiences of refugees through collaborative research strategies and maximizes the capacity of this minority population to meaningfully contribute to the academic discourse. Using Photovoice, a technique that employs still photography and text captions, participants used aesthetic expression to deconstruct and reconstruct notions of resilience. Six, monthly 3-h focus groups were conducted on topics pertaining to resilience during which still images were reviewed. Adopting a grounded theory approach, line-by-line coding and thematic analysis of the focus group transcripts were completed in order to respond to the research question. Faith and spirituality, circles of support, and the global community were the key overarching themes describing participants' resilience process which enabled participants to survive their past foster support in the present and harness hope for the future. At each stage, supporting and protective factors and threats undermining resiliency were identified. In conclusion, recommendations for an enhanced conceptualization of resilience were made for resettlement service providers and those engaging with refugee populations.

T1  - Multicultural Media Use and Immigrant Settlement: A Comparative Study of Four Communities in Ottawa, Canada
AN  - 1886222538
AB  - Multicultural media serve as important sources of information for immigrant settlement. However, little is known about the role of multicultural media in the process of immigrant settlement. Our aim was to address this gap and to advance understanding of multicultural media use and immigrant settlement through a detailed empirical study involving four ethnocultural and immigrant communities (EICs)--the Chinese, Spanish-speaking Latin American, Somali, and South Asian--in Ottawa, Canada. Using a conceptual framework combining notions of immigrant contexts of reception, and immigrant settlement and information seeking, we present and analyze the findings of a large survey data set (N=1212) comparing types of multicultural print, broadcast, and digital media use by immigration category, length of stay, and yearly household income. Based on our findings, we argue that variations exist in the use of multicultural media both within and across the four participating EICs; while factors such as availability of multicultural media as well as length of stay in Canada and, to some extent, household income play a role, immigration category is less significant. Furthermore, we advance that although EICs do use various types of multicultural media, they tend to favor digital media. These findings contribute to improved understanding of the role of multicultural media use in the everyday lives of EICs and provide directions for future research and for the development of relevant policies and practices to address immigrant information needs and facilitate their settlement process.

T1  - “A bitter diversion”: Afro-Cuban immigrants, race, and everyday-life resistance
AN  - 1891616262
AB  - This article offers insight into how race intervenes into the everyday lives of post-1980 Afro-Cuban immigrants living in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California. Drawing from in-depth interviews, it explores their responses to being constantly questioned about their racial and ethnic identities by people of various backgrounds, including “white” Cubans and people of Mexican origin. While they perceive some inquiries to be simply the result of curiosity, they believe other questions denote a rejection of their multiplicity and their blackness. They counteract such “micro-level rejections” through the use of affective strategies, including humor and “negative” emotion. By focusing on such resistance strategies, the study highlights Afro-Cuban agency and affirms the emotional work they put forth as they confront the daily annoyances that come from being deemed an “other.” Furthermore, the article captures how Afro-Cubans challenge normative definitions of Cuban American identity and complicate questions about racial/ethnic identity and blackness.

T1  - Losing Wallets, Retaining Trust? The Relationship Between Ethnic Heterogeneity and Trusting Coethnic and Non-coethnic Neighbours and Non-neighbours to Return a Lost Wallet
AN  - 1879382767
AB  - The constrict claim that ethnic heterogeneity drives down social trust has been empirically tested across the globe. Meta-analyses suggest that neighbourhood ethnic heterogeneity generally undermines ties within the neighbourhood (such as trust in neighbours), but concurrently has an inconsistent or even positive effect on interethnic ties (such as outgroup trust). While the composition of the living environment thus often seems to matter, when and where remain unclear. We contribute to the literature by: (1) scrutinizing the extent to which ethnic heterogeneity drives down trust in coethnic neighbours, non-coethnic neighbours, unknown neighbours and unknown non-neighbours similarly; (2) comparing effects of heterogeneity aggregated to geographical areas that vary in scale and type of boundary; and (3) assessing whether the impact of heterogeneity of the local area depends on the wider geographic context. We test our hypotheses on the Religion in Dutch Society 2011-2012 dataset, supplemented with uniquely detailed GIS-data of Statistics Netherlands. Our dependent variables are four different so-called wallet-items, which we model through spatial and multilevel regression techniques. We demonstrate that both trust in non-coethnic and coethnic neighbours are lower in heterogeneous environments. Trust in people outside the neighbourhood is not affected by local heterogeneity. Measures of heterogeneity aggregated to relatively large scales, such as, administrative municipalities and egohoods with a 4000 m radius, demonstrate the strongest negative relationships with our trust indicators.

T1  - Digital belongings: The intersections of social cohesion, connectivity and digital media
AN  - 1871585235
AB  - The rapid proliferation and ongoing transformation of digital technologies and social media platforms have had a substantial influence on the participatory cultures of young people and their associated social connections. This social/digital nexus raises important questions of social cohesion, with digital technologies at once augmenting social interaction whilst simultaneously creating an uneven landscape of access for participation. To address this interface of the digital and the social, this paper presents a qualitative study of 24 tertiary students from ethnic minority backgrounds living in Auckland, New Zealand, who use social media. Incorporating a pre-screening questionnaire, a one-week social media diary and semi-structured interviews, this study presents the ways in which digital belongings influence participants' practices of friendship and family. The ways that connective media influence, and even constrain interaction alongside the politics of belongings, are theorised to further examine the meanings and experiences behind participants' social media usage and social contact. By integrating these ideas, this paper presents the ways in which young university students use social media and the extent to which digital interaction and networking influence social participation and social cohesion.

T1  - Direct and extended intergenerational contact and young people's attitudes towards older adults
AN  - 1816560100
AB  - Research suggests that positive intergenerational contact can improve young people's attitudes towards older adults. However, today's age-segregated society may not provide ample opportunities for positive contact between younger and older adults to occur on a regular basis. In three studies, we investigated whether the positive attitudinal outcomes associated with direct contact might also stem from a more indirect form of intergenerational relationship: extended contact. In Study 1 (N = 70), extended contact was associated with more positive attitudes towards older adults even when controlling for direct intergenerational contact (contact frequency and contact quality). In Study 2 (N = 110), the positive effects of direct and extended contact on young people's age-related attitudes were mediated by reductions in intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety. The mediational effects of intergroup anxiety were replicated in Study 3 (N = 95) and ingroup norms additionally emerged as a mediator of the positive effects of extended contact on young people's attitudes towards older adults. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at tackling ageism.

T1  - The Trump Hypothesis: Testing Immigrant Populations as a Determinant of Violent and Drug-Related Crime in the United States*
AN  - 1812542694
AB  - Objectives 
To test the "Trump Hypothesis": whether immigrants are responsible for higher levels of violent and drug-related crime in the United States, as asserted by Donald Trump in his 2015 presidential campaign announcement. This is achieved using recent crime and immigration data, thus testing the common public perception linking immigrants to crime, and providing an updated assessment of the immigrant-crime nexus. 
Methods 
Rates of violent crime and drug arrests by state are pooled for 2012-2014. These are compared against pooled statistics on foreign-born and Mexican nationals living in the United States, as well as estimates of undocumented foreign and undocumented Mexican population by state. The data are analyzed using correlation and multivariate regressions. 
Results 
Data uniformly show no association between immigrant population size and increased violent crime. However, there appears to be a small but significant association between undocumented immigrant populations and drug-related arrests. 
Conclusions 
Results largely contradict the Trump Hypothesis: no evidence links Mexican or undocumented Mexican immigrants specifically to violent or drug-related crime. Undocumented immigrant associations with drug-related crime are minimal, though significant. The Trump Hypothesis consequently appears to be biased toward rhetoric rather than evidence.

T1  - Are Residential and Workplace Concentration Correlated for Immigrants? Evidence for Sweden
AN  - 1811906031
AB  - In immigrant-receiving countries, immigrants are often concentrated in residential neighbourhoods with high concentrations of immigrants. In addition, they are concentrated in workplaces with high concentrations of immigrants. Many researchers have assumed that these are two sides of the same coin, so that policy affecting residential segregation could be expected to influence workplace segregation. Using Swedish register data for 2007, we directly assess whether immigrants who live in residential neighbourhoods concentrated with immigrants also work in firms concentrated with immigrants. We find that there is very little correlation between residential and workplace segregation, suggesting that policy could profitably target both types of segregation separately.

T1  - Mixed Couples and Critical Cosmopolitanism: Experiences of Cross-border Love
AN  - 1801919014
AB  - Research on intermarriage until now has focused mainly on the challenging nature of interculturality and on the adaptation strategies of migrant spouses. As a consequence, native-born partners' change in an intercultural family environment has been scarcely envisioned. What we suggest in this study of mixed couples in Spain is a necessary turn on the positive aspects of cross-cultural communication and on in-couple learning dynamics, which develop in the process of mutual intercultural adaptation. Our purpose is to shed light on cross-border love as a space of self-transformation where the original forms of dialogue and hyphenated social identities are built. Mixed couples have shown to be valuable cases for exploring and exemplifying dynamics of cosmopolitanism on a micro level. The results of this study provide empirical evidence to support the theory of critical cosmopolitanism and cross-cultural adaptation and transformation theory.

T1  - Ethnic Identity in Emerging Adults in Sub-Saharan Africa and the USA, and Its Associations with Psychological Well-Being
AN  - 1784567849
AB  - Ethnic identity as a social dimension of identity is argued to be developmentally important for psychological well-being. However, the relationships between these constructs are mainly examined in Western contexts, amongst dominant-non-dominant groups. We investigate ethnic identity across the mainstream group of a prototypical Western society (the USA) and several multi-ethnic sub-Saharan African countries (Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia), as well as how it relates to psychological well-being. A total of 1255 university students (61.8% females, Mage=20.94 years, SD=2.97) completed a questionnaire with ethnic identity and psychological well-being measures. Results indicated that ethnic identity was most salient in two different South African ethnocultural samples and least salient in a mainstream US sample. These results suggest that groups that are more exposed to ethnic strain in multicultural societies tend to have more salient ethnic identities. Furthermore, the underlying structure in the ethnic identity psychological well-being relationship was similar across groups. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Divided and Conquered: Immigration Reform Advocates and the Passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act
AN  - 1786515758
AB  - During and immediately after World War II, immigration reform advocacy groups successfully challenged the restrictionist spirit of the 1924 Immigration Act by blocking several proposals to halt immigration and by pushing for moderate reforms. Concerned that the blatantly racist act undermined US foreign policy interests and tarnished the country's image abroad, Congress, with the full support of the executive, repealed Chinese exclusion laws; granted citizenship and naturalization rights to Indians and Filipinos; and admitted war brides, fiancées, and European refugees outside the quota system. Marinari argues the debate and the negotiations over the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act demonstrate the limits of the inclusiveness of the US political system during the early years of the Cold War and the difficulties of creating diverse coalitions among ethnically diverse immigration reform advocates.

T1  - Securitization of migration and the far right: the case of Greek security professionals
AN  - 1774373966
AB  - Since the events of 9/11, security concerns have gained unprecedented dominance on western governments' national and international political agendas; Greece has been no exception. The success or failure of a far right party, like Golden Dawn, depends on the effectiveness of the government to regulate immigration and to develop policies aimed at combating the racism which pervades the political culture of society at this particular juncture, when the country is experiencing severe crisis. The aim is to provide an account of the rationale of the securitization of migration from the perspective of Greek security professionals. We argue that the extreme securitizing perceptions of security professionals have been exploited and assisted by far-right extremist groups, which instilled racial violence, hate speech/crime into society, resulting in patterned, unreflective, and routinized security practices and discourses which are more in line with the beliefs and values advocated by the extreme right.

T1  - Vile vigilance: An integrated theoretical framework for understanding the state of Black surveillance
AN  - 1768022945
AB  - The family is the principal source of socialization and protection against racism for many Blacks. Transmitting values, norms, morals, and beliefs (i.e., racial socialization) to successive generations is done to promote racial awareness and to prepare an individual to survive in racist environments. Further, developing a sense of security, resiliency, and cultural pride provides psychological protection against racial prejudice and discrimination. Protective socialization is even more critical when it becomes the difference between life and death at the hands of law enforcement-a fate faced by too many Black males as a result of racist policing practices, including the over-patrolling of Black communities. Because discriminatory surveillance and over-patrolling can incite a number of social, physical, and mental health issues, a holistic approach to understanding the interaction between Blacks and law enforcement is critical. This article reviews the Mundane Extreme Environmental Stress (MEES) model, racial socialization theory, and Family Stress Model in the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the patterns of interactions between Blacks and law enforcement, the immediate and long-term effects of unjustified shootings on Black families and communities, and the response of sociopolitical systems. The new theoretical framework will be used to inform the work of human service providers and practitioners by identifying targets for interventions to improve relations and trust between Black communities and law enforcement institutions.

T1  - How ordinary people view Muslim group rights in Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany: significant 'gaps' between majorities and Muslims?
AN  - 1784151267
AB  - Taking four countries-Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany-with distinct state approaches and public debates over accommodating Muslims, we study the views of ordinary people from the majority and Muslim populations on Muslim group rights. We compare their responses to questions on mosque-building, teachers wearing religious symbols, and religious classes in schools, to determine whether there is a significant 'gap' between the majority and Muslim minorities. We find highly significant 'gaps' between the majorities and Muslims over Muslim group rights in all countries, with the majorities less supportive. Importantly, it is a shift by the majority population against Muslim group rights that produces this 'gap' as the question moves from provision for Christians to Muslims, while Muslims hold similar views over rights for Christians and their own religion. In Britain and Germany, the two countries where church/state relations privilege Christianity over other religions, majorities especially support Christian over Muslim group rights. The British findings are remarkable, because a country which substantially grants and has the most supportive public debate for Muslim group rights, produces the largest 'gaps' between its majority and Muslims. We think this is due to political context, where in contrast to the Netherlands, there is no outlet for political opposition to Muslim group rights.

T1  - Developments and Complementarities in International Migration Paradigms
AN  - 1760244490
AB  - This paper reviews studies of international migration in the early twenty-first century by critically examining developments in the settlement, assimilation and adaptation paradigms before considering diasporic and transnational approaches, and complementarities in migration studies. The aim is to suggest first where considerations from sub-disciplines can benefit other sub-disciplines, and second, where communications across disciplines can be extended beyond those underway.

T1  - Immigrant Enclave Thesis Reconsidered: Case of Chinese Immigrants in the Enclave and Mainstream Economy in Canada
AN  - 1760241857
AB  - Since the development of the immigrant enclave thesis, there has been a disagreement regarding whether the immigrant enclave hurts or benefits individual immigrants' earnings. The controversy mainly arises from the imprecise way by which enclave participation is measured and from the difference in performance between entrepreneurs and workers. This study uses data from the 2006 Census of Canada to examine how Chinese immigrants who participate in the mainstream economy and enclave economy differ in earnings. Using "the language used most often at work" to determine enclave participation, the study finds that actual and net earnings of Chinese immigrants in the enclave are lower than those of their counterparts in the mainstream economy. However, when the interaction between human capital and enclave participation is considered, human capital brings a net negative return to enclave participants, but at the same time, a positive effect associated with enclave participation. The positive effect may be understood as coming from unmeasured ethnic and cultural features of the enclave that provide a cushion to lessen the magnitude of income disadvantages in the enclave. The study suggests that there is evidence to support both sides of the debate: enclave participants have lower net returns, but the enclave provides a cushioning effect in reducing earnings disparities. The study suggests that integration policy towards immigrants may consider immigrant enclaves as providing some support to immigrants to soften some disadvantages, but enclaves do not offer the same opportunities as the mainstream economy.

T1  - How Symbolic Boundaries Shape the Experience of Social Exclusion: A Case Comparison of Arab Palestinian Citizens and Ethiopian Jews in Israel: PROD
AN  - 1754113863
AB  - Symbolic boundaries, understood as the conceptual distinctions used to demarcate in-groups and out-groups, are fundamental to social inequality. While we know a great deal about how groups and individuals construct and contest symbolic boundaries along lines of class, race, ethnicity, religion, and nationality, less attention is given to (a) national belonging as a component of symbolic boundaries distinct from citizenship and (b) comparing how distinct symbolic boundaries shape individuals perceptions of, and reactions to, instances of stigmatization and discrimination. To examine these issues we compared two marginalized groups in Israel, Arab Palestinian citizens and Ethiopian Jewish immigrants. Analyzing 90 in-depth interviews, we find that exclusion based on boundaries of nationality engenders different ways of interpretating and responding to stigmatizing and discriminatory behavior, compared with exclusion based on racial and ethnic boundaries. While Ethiopians see everyday stigmatizing encounters as part of their temporary position as a recently immigrated group from a developing country, and react accordingly with attempts to prove their worth as individuals and ultimately assimilate, Palestinians view the line between them and the Jewish majority as relatively impermeable and attempts to fully integrate as mostly useless, viewing solidarity and education as a means to improve their group's standing.

T1  - "There's Hardly Anything Left": Poverty and the Economic Insecurity of Elderly Filipinos in Toronto
AN  - 1815477165
AB  - As the Canadian population becomes more racially diverse, so does its elderly population. This article focuses on elderly Filipinos, whose country of origin has become the largest source of immigrants to Canada since 2006. It draws from a university-community partnership and a mixed method research of surveying 250 and interviewing 20 elderly Filipinos in Toronto to document their economic condition. With seven out of ten living in poverty, our research reveals that economic insecurity is a fact of life for most elderly Filipinos in Canada. We elaborate on their impoverished living situation by delineating three major themes from our literature review (understanding poverty, factors contributing to poverty, and outcomes of poverty) and by foregrounding particular experiences of elderly Filipinos that illustrate and extend these themes. Taking intersectionality as our analytical paradigm, we consider the poverty of elderly Filipinos as shedding light on the interlocking ways in which later life circumstances are intricately shaped and impacted by class, race, gender, and immigration. Their economic insecurity is also intimately connected to the deskilling and deprofessionalization of Filipinos in Canada, a major structural condition that has produced and reinforced the ongoing marginalization of this racialized minority community. Alternate abstract:Comme la population canadienne affiche de plus en plus une diversité raciale, il en va ainsi de ses aînés. Cet article met l'accent sur les personnes âgées de race philippine, dont le pays d'origine représente la plus grande source d'immigrants au Canada depuis 2006. Afin de documenter leur condition économique, l'étude adopte une recherche partenariale université-communauté ainsi qu'une approche mixte de sondages sur 250 aînés philippins habitant à Toronto, et d'interviews sur 20 d'entre eux. Avec sept candidats sur dix vivant sous le seuil de la pauvreté, notre recherche révèle que l'insécurité économique est une réalité quotidienne pour la plupart des aînés philippins au Canada. Nous nous penchons sur leur situation précaire en délimitant trois thèmes majeurs propre à notre analyse documentaire (la compréhension de la pauvreté, les facteurs qui contribuent à la pauvreté, et les effets de la pauvreté) et en mettant de l'avant les particulières expériences des aînés philippins qui illustrent les thèmes en question. En utilisant la notion d'intersectionnalité comme point de vue analytique, nous considérons que la pauvreté des aînés philippins met la lumière sur les façons dont les circonstances de la vie à un âge avancé sont intrinsèquement moulées et influencées par la classe sociale, la race, le sexe et l'immigration. En outre, leur insécurité économique est intimement liée à la déqualification et à la déprofessionnalisation des Philippins au Canada, des composantes majeures qui ont entraîné, puis renforcé la marginalisation continue de cette communauté minoritaire racialisée.

T1  - Markers of identity in Martinique: being French, black, Creole
AN  - 1751730935
AB  - Martinican identity involves the negotiation of multiple markers of difference. These often conflicting identities have been powerfully played out as a form of cultural politics: the Negritude movement, which emphasised African roots, the Creolite movement, which proclaimed Martinique's identity as a unique mix of multiple cultures, and the ever-present pull of the French assimilationist state. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between these intellectual and political discourses and the lived experiences of people living on the island. It draws on examples of what are labelled intellectual, environmental, social, and Creole markers, and explores the ways in which identity is inscribed on Martinique's physical, social, and cultural landscape. Using the prism of markers as an analytical tool to think through the ways in which identity has been asserted, prescribed, and analysed in Martinique, it examines the interplay between diverging manifestations of identity: intellectualized from above and lived, practised, and contested from below.

AB  - This article examines the significance of the growing presence of Mexican immigrants in Hawai'i. Drawing on Census Bureau data, qualitative surveys and in-depth interviews, we discuss Mexican immigrants' experiences as economic and cultural outsiders in Hawai'i and their encounters with police and immigration enforcement. We argue that Hawai'i's case requires an analysis of the role of US settler colonialism and its intersections with racism and economic inequality currently absent in theoretical models developed to understand the volatility that Latinos introduce to Black-White dynamics.

T1  - Integration through Sports? Polish Migrants in the Ruhr, Germany
AN  - 1744618394
AB  - Sport, and football in particular, is described in socio-political discourse as an effective way to integrate immigrants. This thesis will be tested by means of a case study examining Polish migration to the mining areas of the Ruhr from the 1870s. It will be shown that, up until World War I, the sport participated in by Polish miners served, in contrast, as a means of nationalization, ethnicizing, and as an aid to furthering Polish ethnic identity. Only during the Weimar Republic were football clubs in the Ruhr actually used as a vehicle for integration and assimilation for males among the Polish minority. After World War II, memories of these footballers from among the Polish minority were either repressed or reduced to folklore. Based on this historical case study, sport appears in principle to be ambivalent between its ability to form "we" groups and the building of bridges between nationalities.

T1  - The Dynamics of Race and Ethnicity in the US Coal Industry
AN  - 1744618365
AB  - By the turn of the twenty-first century, scholars had transformed our understanding of class, race, and ethnicity in the rise and demise of the US coal industry. Under the twin impact of the modern Black Freedom Movement and the rise of the New Labor History, studies of American labor and race relations fragmented during the late twentieth century. Following the lead of pioneering labor historian Herbert Gutman, one influential body of scholarship resuscitated the early history of the United Mine Workers of America and accented the emergence of remarkable forms of labor solidarity across the color line during the industrial era. Before this scholarship could gain a firm footing in the historiography of labor and working-class history, however, social activist and labor scholar Herbert Hill forcefully argued that emerging emphases on interracial working-class cooperation downplayed the persistence of racial divisions even during the most promising episodes of labor unity. In significant ways, the Hill-Gutman debate fueled the florescence of whiteness studies and the myriad ways that both capital and labor benefitted from a racially stratified workforce. Based upon this rapidly expanding historiography of coalminers in America, this essay explores how the overlapping experiences of black and white miners established the foundation for modes of cooperation as well as conflict, but the persistence of white supremacist ideology and social practices repeatedly undermined sometimes heroic movements to bridge the chasm between black and white workers.

T1  - Media, Racial Identity, and Mainstream American Values
AN  - 1784145824
AB  - A survey of 499 Black, Asian, and White American college students assessed their endorsement of "mainstream" American values, uncovering a 6-factor values structure, with some notable significant differences between the races. As expected, White respondents' own personal value orientations most closely matched their assessments of mainstream American values, and stronger racial identity (from a social identity perspective) corresponded to an even closer match. A variety of media consumption measures correlated with personal/mainstream American values congruence, with greater media exposure predicting greater endorsement of mainstream values, but most relationships were eclipsed when controlling for demographics, race, and racial identity. Predictors that maintained under controls included music TV and sports programming exposure, pointing to the potential importance of such particular media forms in the process of value-based cultural assimilation and reinforcement.

T1  - Freedom of religion, women's agency and banning the face veil: the role of feminist beliefs in shaping women's opinion
AN  - 2100413765
AB  - Several countries have imposed bans on the wearing of face veils, a controversial option considered in Bill 94 by the province of Quebec in 2010. This paper examines non-Muslim women's support for the acceptability of the niqab in public spaces. Analysing the 2010 Quebec Women's Political Participation Survey, we find that key feminist arguments - that wearing the niqab is a woman's free choice, a matter of freedom of religion and a visible symbol of women's oppression - are important drivers of opinion. Their role in shaping opinion, however, is complex and mirrors divisions among feminist groups in the province. Additional attitudinal drivers include generation, exposure to the practice and openness to immigration. Equally important, our findings suggest that being a member of a racial minority, feelings of cultural insecurity and religiosity are of little consequence for thinking on the issue.

T1  - What Difference Does Difference Make? The Persistence of Inequalities in Healthcare Delivery
AN  - 1735658578; 201536863
AB  - Scholars across many disciplines have amassed a mountain of research documenting how social differences along lines of race, class, gender, and sexuality shape how those who need medical attention are cared for in the US healthcare system. Here, we aim to succinctly review a selection of studies that have considered the many ways both patients' and healthcare providers' social identities can impact care delivery. After establishing how these differences influence patient-provider interactions and patient diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes, we argue that a critical sociological perspective can help us to better understand why these inequities persist despite decades of research calling attention to them. Specifically, we suggest that research guided by symbolic interactionist and intersectional frameworks can generate more comprehensive analyses of inequality in healthcare delivery and help researchers delve deeper into the complex interactional processes undergirding disparities in care provision. We conclude by highlighting recent work that illustrates the value of this approach. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - INVESTIGATING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN LATINO ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS
AN  - 1842827815
AB  - Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS), this study explores psychological distress in Latino/Latino intraracial and Latino/White interracial relationships. The term Latino refers to ethnicity, which emphasizes national origin as opposed to race. However, this paper classifies Latino relationships as either an intraracial or interracial relationship for the sake of consistency and simplicity. A social stress framework informs this study as two stressors-perceived discrimination and relationship satisfaction-are examined in relationship to distress. The buffering effect of social support is observed as well. Results show that perceived discrimination is an important stressor for both relationship groups, but relationship satisfaction is only important for Latino/Latino relationships. Social support buffers the impact of discrimination, but only for Latino/Latino relationships. Interaction effects that explore the influence of gender and social class with key explanatory variables are also investigated.

T1  - My Friend is Gay, But... The Effects of Social Contact on Christian Evangelicals' Beliefs About Gays and Lesbians
AN  - 1768537011
AB  - This paper examines the relationship between social contact with gays and lesbians and beliefs about homosexuality, and explicitly investigates whether this relationship is different for Christian evangelicals than for others. We find that although social contact with gays and lesbians is related to beliefs about homosexuality in ways predicted by social contact theory, those with a gay or lesbian friend hold more positive attitudes, this is not the case for Christian evangelicals. In fact, analyses reveal that the effect of social contact for Christian evangelicals is significantly less than the effect for non-evangelicals. Results suggest that social contact alone is not enough to positively change Christian evangelicals' beliefs about gay and lesbian individuals. This research adds to our knowledge about social contact by providing empirical evidence that all subgroups of the population are not affected equally by social contact with minority groups -- an important piece of information for theoretical developments and policy makers.

T1  - Media Effects on Support for European Integration in Old and New EU Member States
AN  - 1695229684
AB  - The study measures the strength of media effects on attitudes to EU integration. Media exposure is the independent variable; support for European integration is the dependent variable; socio-economic conditions and cognitive-cultural variables are contextual variables. The analysis covers 27 EU member states at the time of 2009 EP election. Both micro-level variables and country-level effects were taken into consideration in hierarchical linear models. Data from the PIREDEU study was used. Analyses document weak influence of media exposure on attitudes. The overall positive effect is mostly concentrated in stable democracies with well-developed media systems.

T1  - Resilience of Ideology as a Vanguard of Movement: A Study of North Eastern Turbulence
AN  - 1761679609; 201602239
AB  - Ideology is a very crucial component of any movement and for its understanding. Unlike other features of a movement, which are easily perceived and made explicit, ideology is often vague and may or may not be present at the early stage of a movement. The article analyses an aspect of ideology wherein its capacity to withstand economic and political forces is considerably minimised. Examination of some past and present movements supports the proposition that sometimes ideology loses its resilience when lured by economic and political incentives. However, rare instances of open acceptance of failure of ideology to withstand the lure of economic and political benefits are often misunderstood for its resilience. Ideology that shapes and protects identity of certain majority group is also bound to change to accommodate smaller groups for various reasons.

T1  - Hispanic Immigration and Black Violence at the Macro-Level: Examining the Conditioning Effect of Victim Race/Ethnicity
AN  - 1700676215; 201525221
AB  - Much attention has been devoted to the relationship between Hispanic immigration and violent offending at the macro-level, including how it varies across racial and ethnic groups. Unfortunately, little attention has been paid to the conditioning effect of the race/ethnicity of the victim, or how Hispanic immigration is associated with crime by one racial/ethnic group against members of the same or different groups. Using National Incident-Based Reporting System offending estimates and American Community Survey data, we examine the association between Hispanic immigration and black intra- and intergroup (black-on-white and black-on-Hispanic) homicide, robbery, and serious index violence in over 350 U.S. communities. We employ advanced imputation methods to address missing data that have constrained much prior research, as well as utilize crime measures adjusted for the likelihood of random contact between groups. Findings suggest that (1) Hispanic immigration has a positive association with black violence on the whole, but that (2) this association is conditioned by the race/ethnicity of the victim. Our results reinforce the importance of distinguishing across offender-victim dyads in research on the immigration-crime nexus, particularly in light of competing theoretical expectations. Directions for future research and policy are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnolinguistic Identification, Vitality, and Gratifications for Television Use in a Bilingual Media Environment
AN  - 1662632213
AB  - This article tests a model predicting minority language television consumption. We examine how four media gratifications (diversion, ethnolinguistic identity, surveillance, parasocial companionship) mediate the relationship between ethnolinguistic identification and choice of ingroup language television viewing. The study is performed among (minority) Hungarian speakers in Transylvania, Romania. Self-report questionnaire data from 401 Hungarian-speaking high school students in Csíkszereda/Miercurea Ciuc (a majority Hungarian locale) and Brassó/Braov (a minority Hungarian locale) allowed us to compare high and low local vitality conditions. Analysis indicates that diversion (entertainment) and ethnolinguistic identity gratifications for watching ingroup language television are the strongest mediators of the influence of identification on ingroup language television use. We examined four moderators of these indirect effects (objective vitality, subjective vitality, intergroup contact, and intragroup contact). The moderators revealed a number of rather complex effects which are discussed with regard to the local intergroup context and broader issues of media and intergroup relations.

T1  - Local Voting Rights for Non-Nationals: Experience in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium
AN  - 1829550399
AB  - This article explores the impact of local voting rights accorded to non-nationals in Sweden, the Netherlands and Belgium. The first two countries have some three-decade experience with such voting rights; while in Belgium, the expanded franchise was first exercised in 2006. Drawing on qualitative research carried out in the three countries, the author reviews the rationale for the reforms, the parameters of the franchise and trends in migrants' democratic involvement, including their election to municipal and other representative bodies. In Sweden and the Netherlands, non-nationals' turnout in local elections is generally lower than that for citizens and has tended to decline over time (although there are exceptions, such as the 2006 Dutch local elections in Amsterdam and Rotterdam). Non-nationals' participation in Belgium's two commune elections since the law was changed was low (and dropped slightly between 2006 and 2012). Introducing non-national local voting rights may be making a modest contribution to migrant political integration (including through the election of representatives from a migration background) in the three countries, but other factors, including political parties' recruitment strategies and minority community mobilization, are probably more important. As for lessons that could be applied elsewhere, the author is critical of rules that create obstacles to non-nationals' electoral participation and thus seem to contradict what should be seen as a gesture of inclusion.

T1  - Transgender people of color at the center: Conceptualizing a new intersectional model
AN  - 1667948938; 201509476
AB  - Some transgender people in the USA actively experience changes in institutional power linked to transitioning. As such, they serve as informants to the interconnections of institutional inequalities and social identities and positions. Centering the experiences of 'trans' people of color and drawing from feminist standpoint theory, I theorize a multifaceted prism to expand upon existing intersectional models by linking multifaceted social positions to institutional inequalities and challenging dichotomous understandings of categories. I then use this multifaceted prism to critique my own positionality as a researcher and to analyze experiences of trans people of color.

T1  - The presence of the past: Identity continuity and group dynamics
AN  - 1758417025
AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to ingroup continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

T1  - Symbolic Racism and Emotional Responses to the 2012 Presidential Candidates
AN  - 1708527405; 201528667
AB  - Racial attitudes toward African American candidates are partially explained by symbolic racism, which has replaced overt racism in responses to these candidates. However, as typically operationalized, symbolic racism as applied to candidate assessments fails to account for the emotions generated by a political campaign. Symbolic racism's effects are moderated when emotional responses to Barack Obama are included in a candidate evaluation model, while emotions remain an important predictor. While symbolic racism and negative emotions lower evaluations, the presence of the positive emotions generated by the 2012 campaign counteracted both. Inclusion of both symbolic racism and emotion is necessary to understand perceptions of Obama as a black presidential candidate. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Associations of Race/Ethnicity and Suicidal Ideation among College Students: A Latent Class Analysis Examining Precipitating Events and Disclosure Patterns
AN  - 1622296346; 201438372
AB  - The aim of this paper was to examine precipitating events for suicidal ideation and how these experiences relate to disclosure in a diverse sample of college students were examined. Among non-Hispanic White students, relationship/academic problems were most associated with ideation. A romantic break-up increased the odds of getting help. Among racial/ethnic minority students, family/academic problems were most associated with ideation and students who reported multiple events were less likely to get help compared with those not reporting events. Future research should examine the reasons for interpersonal conflict among this high-risk group and their attitudes about helpseeking, and identify cultural norms associated with disclosure.

T1  - Ethnic diversity, segregation and the social cohesion of neighbourhoods in London
AN  - 1660023549; 201505795
AB  - The question of whether and how ethnic diversity affects the social cohesion of communities has become an increasingly prominent and contested topic of academic and political debate. In this paper we focus on a single city: London. As possibly the most ethnically diverse conurbation on the planet, London serves as a particularly suitable test-bed for theories about the effects of ethnic heterogeneity on prosocial attitudes. We find neighbourhood ethnic diversity in London to be positively related to the perceived social cohesion of neighbourhood residents, once the level of economic deprivation is accounted for. Ethnic segregation within neighbourhoods, on the other hand, is associated with lower levels of perceived social cohesion. Both effects are strongly moderated by the age of individual residents: diversity has a positive effect on social cohesion for young people but this effect dissipates in older age groups; the reverse pattern is found for ethnic segregation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact and Attitudes Toward International Students in Australia: Intergroup Anxiety and Intercultural Communication Emotions as Mediators
AN  - 1520336524; 201412259
AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

T1  - Is Ethnicity Identifiable?: Lessons from an Experiment in South Africa
AN  - 1567046229; 201435137
AB  - Ethnicity is frequently posited as an important factor in civil violence and other political contexts. Despite the attention that ethnicity receives, its effects depend on an important, but mostly ignored, assumption that ethnicity is identifiable within and across groups. There is likely considerable variation in peoples' abilities to identify each other. Certain individuals within groups might be better at identifying others' ethnicities; further, different types of information might aid identification better. We contend that the strength of an individual's ethnic identity influences her ability to identify others correctly. We test this argument using an experiment in the Eastern Cape of South Africa in which individuals attempted to identify members of the major black ethnic groups. We find that the average individual struggles to identify ethnicity correctly in many conditions. Individuals with a stronger identity, however, are often better at correctly identifying the ethnicity of others relative to the average individual. When receiving contradictory information, individuals with stronger identities were sometimes deceived more easily than others. These results have implications for a diverse set of studies relying on the identifiability assumption. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Political Representation of Minorities as Collateral Damage or Gain: The Batwa in Burundi and Rwanda
AN  - 1641424150; 201500307
AB  - There is a remarkable discrepancy between the political representation of the Batwa ethnic minority group in Burundi compared to in Rwanda. Whereas Rwanda's focus on citizenship prevents the Batwa from claiming recognition as a politically salient societal segment, Burundi's governance model, characterized by ethnic, consociational power-sharing, guarantees the political representation of the Batwa in the legislative assemblies. The difference is mainly due to the various modalities of political transition that both countries have experienced. While in Rwanda, regime change came about through a military victory, Bumndi's transition from conflict to peace involved a long and complex peace-negotiations process, with international mediators viewing the armed conflict and its resolution in explicitly ethnic terms. The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement was a foundational moment for the recognition of the political participation rights of the Batwa in Burundi, despite the fact that they were not actively involved in Burundi's armed conflict, or in the peace negotiations. The comparative analysis in this paper offers insights into the potential of peace processes with respect to improved minority-rights protection following violent conflict.

T1  - Whither multiculturalism? Global identities at a cross-roads
AN  - 1559007622; 201432145
AB  - Technological advancement and the quantum leap in global trade had enabled many countries to enter an era of multiculturalism where intergroup contact with members of another ethno-cultural community is the norm rather than the exception. While this phase of economic development is considered progressive by many, it is also regarded as a perilous stage in nation building. Immigration, acculturation, and intergroup tensions will form the nexus of all future contestations with the various social groups negotiating with and/or vying against one another for political rights and status. At the same time, the notion of culture has become increasingly blurred given the multiplicity and interwoven nature of social identity arising from the transnational human movement and the transmission of values. With these considerations in mind, this chapter explores and extrapolates the emerging fabric of multiculturalism across various continents using a historical, socio-political, and psychological lens. Contemporary acculturation and intergroup frameworks are re-visited with the aim to discover new theoretical insights, while keeping in mind the possible trajectory of multiculturalism and how diversity will be managed in the decades to come.

T1  - US Census Classifications and Arab Americans: Contestations and Definitions of Identity Markers
AN  - 1448991638; 201342861
AB  - Arab Americans represent an ethnic group that has been deeply divided over state and Census official classifications of racial, ethnic and ancestry identities. Classified as 'white' by race due to historical court cases, there have been initiatives by Arab American organisations to obtain a sub-race or alternative racial/ethnic checkboxes since the 1980s. The rise of multiculturalism and ethnic pride, combined with influxes of new, more diverse immigrants, has created large segments of Arab Americans who do not feel 'white' and who perceive themselves as persons of colour. The divergent opinions on the race issue and disputes over the meaning and value of 'Arab' and of 'Middle Eastern' led to many contestations of the US federal classifications on race and ethnicity from the mid-1990s. Ongoing negotiations and alliances with the Census Bureau have highlighted the differences between Arab American organisations over self-definitions of community as well as strategies for obtaining state recognition as an ethnic group. Since 1980, the most viable solution has been to create an aggregate ethnic or ancestry group from responses that range from country of origin to broader regional identifiers. The logistical challenges of defining identity markers for Census enumeration have emphasised the diversity and complexity of the communities in question. Through archival legal research, census records, congressional testimonies and interviews with key players, this paper examines how the state's racial definitions have acted to split and unite different elements within the community defined as 'of Arab ancestry'.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup concern for disaster victims of the Japan earthquake
AN  - 1417521865; 201331771
AB  - The study examined the relationships between out-group perception, perceived intergroup conflict, emotions, and concern for out-group victims in the context of the Japanese earthquake of 2011. Six hundred and eighty-six participants in China completed a questionnaire immediately after the earthquake. Results showed that the image of Japan and historical conflicts between the two nations significantly predicted intergroup emotions. A positive image of Japan enhanced Chinese respondents' perceived competence of the Japanese people, which, however, appeared to mitigate concern for the victims. Positive emotions increased participants' concern for Japanese victims. Implications of the research findings are discussed with reference to research on intergroup relations and help following disasters. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Devolving Ethnic Conflicts: The Role of Subgroup Identities for Institutional Intergroup Settlements
AN  - 1373429569; 201328551
AB  - Institutions can contribute to regulating interethnic conflict; however, in many cases, they fail to bring about lasting peace. The article argues that the negligence of subgroup identities accounts for some of this failure. Ethnic groups are often treated as unitary actors even though most consist of various linguistic, tribal, or religious subgroups. When interethnic conflict is settled, subgroup differences may come back to the fore. This 'resurgence' can lead to subgroup conflict about the political and economic resources provided through intergroup institutional settlements. This can in turn undermine the peace-making effect of intergroup arrangements. Different subgroup identity constellations make such destructive effects more or less likely. The article focuses on self-government provisions in the aftermath of violent interethnic conflict and argues that lasting intergroup arrangements are especially challenging when they involve 'contested' ethnic groups.

AN  - 1364702537; 201323576
AB  - This study systematically explores the factors that affect collective identity associations within the Alevi community in Turkey by employing the social identity approach and examining survey data collected through fieldwork. The results show that Kurdish Alevis express lower levels of attachment to their religious identity as compared to Turkish Alevis. The results also indicate that personal experiences of discrimination tend to increase one's prioritization of Alevi identity. Last, no significant differences are observed regarding group identity between Alevis who reside in urban areas and those who live in rural areas. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1347783126; 201318658
AB  - This article reconstructs the history of the nationalist movement among the Dusunic peoples also known as Kadazandusun in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and its demise following the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. It analyses how the 'Kadazan nationalists' elaborated a modern, objectified culture based on cultural traits, symbols and traditions of rural peoples and used print media and local radio to spread it. When the Dusunic peoples were integrated as a minority in Malaysia, the nation builders acquired control of all the main media and excluded their languages and culture. The article then analyses the dynamics of the struggle between the ethnic group and the central government as reflected in cultural production, language development and loss, and in ethnic naming. While these issues reveal competition between various native elites they have nevertheless allowed the growth of a sense of belonging to a Dusunic ethnic group, however named.

T1  - Does Circular Migration Lead to "Guest Worker" Outcomes
AN  - 1315601675; 201307538
AB  - At first at the level of the European Commission, and increasingly also in the European Union's member states, it is being recognized that past labour migration management tools have more or less serious drawbacks in that they produce undesired outcomes and do not sufficiently attain the objectives for which they were designed. The welfare states of north-western Europe are discovering that their desire of the past three decades to restrict labour immigration as much as possible is no longer "in sync" with changing labour market demands, which are growing both for the highly skilled and the unskilled. In order to satisfy the demand for unskilled labour, schemes are being proposed that would allow for circular migration. The European Commission is a forceful promoter of these schemes. Member states such as the Netherlands, which we take as a case in point, are also considering modes by which to allow temporary unskilled labour migration, but seem intent on employing regulatory tools that are not very different from those used in the "guest worker" era, which brought about large-scale settlement. Up to the present time, the resulting ethnic minority groups are the subject of large integration efforts on the part of the receiving states. This begs the question of the extent to which "circular migration" would be different from "guest worker" schemes, in its management and its outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - We disagree with Dixon et al. by maintaining that prejudice is primarily rooted in aversive reactions toward out-group members. However, these reactions are not indicative of negative attributes, such as trait bigotry, but rather normative homophily for peers with similar perceived attributes. Cognitive biases such as stereotype threat perpetuate perceptions of inequipotential and subsequent discrimination, irrespective of individuals' personality characteristics.

T1  - Reducing dehumanisation outcomes towards Blacks: The role of multiple categorisation and of human identity
AN  - 1373428227; 201328361
AB  - This contribution addresses the issue of reduction of dehumanisation towards Blacks, an outgroup that has been historically targeted by heinous prejudice. The study tested, for the first time, whether the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity represents the most optimal condition for reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. The main dependent variables were attribution of secondary emotions and inalienability of human rights. Results highlighted the combination of multiple categorisation and human identity as the most effective strategy in reducing dehumanisation towards Blacks. Evidence of this study sheds light on the possible ways through which conceiving others in terms of complex categorical criteria, that is, as members of the human group in conjunction with other communal or different social categories, can lead to more harmonious intergroup relations.

T1  - 'Survival Employment': Gender and Deskilling among African Immigrants in Canada
AN  - 1766833719
AB  - Recent research points to a growing gap between immigrant and native-born outcomes in the Canadian labour market at the same time as selection processes emphasize recruiting highly educated newcomers. Drawing on interviews with well-educated men and women who migrated from countries in sub-Saharan Africa, this paper explores the gendered processes that produce weak economic integration in Canada. Three-quarters of research participants experienced downward occupational mobility, with the majority employed in low-skilled, low-wage, insecure forms of "survival employment". In a gendered labour market, where common demands for "Canadian experience", "Canadian credentials" and "Canadian accents" were uneven across different sectors of the labour market, women faced particular difficulties finding "survival employment"; in the long run, however, women's greater investment in additional post-secondary education within Canada placed them in a somewhat better position than men. The policy implications of this study are fourfold: first, we raise questions about the efficacy of Canadian immigration policies that prioritize the recruitment of well-educated immigrants without addressing the multiple barriers that result in deskillling; second, we question government policies and settlement practices that undermine more equitable economic integration of immigrants; third, we address the importance of tackling the "everyday racism" that immigrants experience in the Canadian labour market; and finally, we suggest the need to re-think narrowly defined notions of economic integration in light of the gendered nature of contemporary labour markets, and immigrants' own definitions of what constitutes meaningful integration.

T1  - Cooperation Dynamics in a Multiethnic Society: A Case Study from Tamil Nadu
AN  - 1266143668; 201300493
AB  - The importance of ethnic diversity in determining social outcomes and reducing generalized cooperation is increasingly well documented. Theory suggests that cooperation in human groups may depend on reciprocal altruism and frequency of contact, yet these factors have not been linked with ethnic diversity. This study explores how fine-scale components of cooperation -- social exclusivity and reciprocity -- relate to broad-scale social conditions -- ethnic diversity and ethnic stratification -- in villages in Tamil Nadu's Palani hills. Both ethnic diversity and ethnic stratification are associated with declines in indirect reciprocity, although stratification has a larger effect. In addition, stratification is linked to increased social exclusivity. Moreover, measures of direct reciprocity in the form of agricultural labor exchanges are uncorrelated with both diversity and stratification. These results imply (1) that ethnic stratification is more detrimental to cooperation than is ethnic diversity, (2) that social exclusivity and ethnic stratification are mutually reinforcing, and (3) that direct reciprocity is more robust to cooperative failure across ethnic boundaries than is indirect reciprocity. These results confirm and extend current theory of human cooperative regimes and may be of value for community development in multiethnic settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Outgroup Helping as a Tool to Communicate Ingroup Warmth
AN  - 1023031210; 201223743
AB  - The authors extend previous research on the effects of metastereotype activation on outgroup helping by examining in more detail the role of group impression management motives and by studying direct helping (i.e., helping the outgroup believed to hold a negative view of the ingroup). Data from three experiments provided full support for the communicative nature of direct outgroup helping by demonstrating that outgroup helping in response to a negative metastereotype was predicted by participants' concern for the image of their ingroup, but not by their self-image concerns. Moreover, group image concerns predicted outgroup helping but not ingroup helping and predicted outgroup helping only when a negative metastereotype was activated, compared with a positive metastereotype, or a (negative or positive) autostereotype. The results also ruled out an alternative explanation in terms of denying the self-relevance of the metastereotype.

T1  - Balm for The Soul: Immigrant Religion and Emotional Well-Being
AN  - 1766830186
AB  - Immigrants can face insurmountable odds in their acculturation to the new society, and subsequently suffer from poor emotional/mental health. Using immigrant data from the United States, Australia, and Western Europe, this paper tests the relationship between immigrant religious involvement and emotional well-being. Results demonstrate that regular religious participation is associated with better emotional/mental health outcomes. Conversely, non-religious group involvement (i.e., ethnic associations, leisure groups, work groups) do not have as equally a positive association with emotional well-being. This pattern is consistent across all countries examined in this study, suggesting that religion has a unique relationship with immigrant emotional well-being regardless of national context. Therefore, it is posited that in easing the emotional/mental adjustment of immigrants, religion is not an artifact of context or of a particular religious group, but a generality of immigrant adaptation. Policy implications for the study's findings are discussed. Yet to him, in his troubled state, Christianity brought also the miracle of redemption. Poor thing that he was, his soul was yet a matter of consequence. For him the whole drama of salvation had been enacted: God had come to earth, had suffered as a man to make for all men a place in a life everlasting. Through that sacrifice had been created a community of all those who had faith, a kind of solidarity that would redress all grievances and right all wrongs, if not now, then in the far more important aftermath to life.

T1  - Multiculturalism from Above and Below: Analysing a Political Discourse
AN  - 1081865185; 201235399
AB  - Comments on Nasar Meer and Tariq Modood's "How Does Interculturalism Contrast with Multiculturalism?" (same journal issue). I argue in this paper that multiculturalism is a political discourse that is always positioned. Augmenting Meer and Modood's consideration of the merits of multiculturalism vs. interculturalism, I highlight the central role that multiculturalism from above can play, at least in Britain, in facilitating, indeed requiring, intercultural or inter-faith openness and dialogue. It is thus extremely counterproductive, I argue, that politicians tend to use multiculturalism as a euphemism for immigration or extremism. All they achieve by the failure-of-multiculturalism discourse is a growing sense of alienation among religious and ethnic minorities who in any case rely on autonomous internal resources to perpetuate their culture and religion and create 'community'.

T1  - Perceiving Status (In)stability in a Low-Status Group: The Effects of Identification on Explicit and Implicit Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1037886682; 201230957
AB  - We examined whether perceptions of status (in)stability moderate the effects of ingroup identification on explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. We expected that identification with Italians (low-status group) would enhance ingroup bias toward (US) Americans (high-status group) more when status was unstable rather than stable. We also predicted that the effects of identification on bias would be driven by ingroup enhancement for explicit attitudes and by both ingroup enhancement and outgroup derogation for implicit attitudes. The results revealed that identification increased explicit ingroup evaluation and ingroup bias independently from status (in)stability. However, identification increased implicit outgroup derogation only with unstable status. The results are discussed with reference to social identity theory and to the importance of considering both explicit and implicit attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Effect of Classroom Diversity on Tolerance and Participation in England, Sweden and Germany
AN  - 1023030546; 201223877
AB  - The belief is widespread in educational circles that ethnically mixed schools contribute to inter-ethnic tolerance and community cohesion. Some political science studies, however, have found that trust and participation are lower in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. This paper explores the relation between classroom ethno-racial diversity, ethnic tolerance and participation in England, Sweden and Germany using data from the IEA Civic Education Study among 14-year-olds. Controlling for various conditions at the individual and classroom levels, it finds a positive effect of classroom diversity on ethnic tolerance in Sweden and Germany, which is in agreement with the contact perspective on inter-ethnic relations. However, it does not find an effect on tolerance in England. Moreover, classroom diversity only shows a positive relation with participation in Sweden. The effect of diversity thus varies substantially across the two outcomes of interest and the three countries examined. It is therefore tentatively concluded that country-specific factors shape this effect to a significant degree. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Study of social interaction among students of Vision Schools in Malaysia
AN  - 1023029100; 201224013
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the social interaction among students of various ethnic groups at Vision Schools in Malaysia. The focus is mainly on Malays, Chinese and Indians with a sample size of 642 students. This research applies the quantitative and qualitative approach. For the qualitative approach, the researcher used focus group interviews and observations to examine social interaction among students of various ethnic groups. In this research there is one independent variable to explain and predict eleven independent variables. Hypotheses were analysed using post-hoc and multivariate analysis at a p < 0.05 significance level. Findings of the study indicated there were significant difference in the mean score levels for all the independent variables. Study showed high social distance scale for Malay and Chinese students. All the dependent variables effected social interaction among students. Based on the results various suggestions have been recommended and it is hoped that these suggestions will help those involved in teaching and learning to have a better understanding concerning social interaction among Malay, Chinese and Indian students at Vision Schools in Malaysia.

T1  - Turf Wars: Local Context and Latino Political Development
AN  - 1018353297; 201212825
AB  - Research demonstrates that competition over resources can have an important influence on minority political behavior. To date, however, the effects of these local conditions on Latino political behavior have gone largely unexamined. Employing a most similar case study design to overcome the lack of data on intragroup attitudes and political behavior nationally, we examine the voting behavior of Cubans and non-Cuban Hispanics in two Florida counties. The group position thesis holds that status inequalities and perceived discrimination yield out-group hostilities that can influence political behavior. In Miami, where Cubans are dominant, we expect non-Cuban Latinos to report greater pan-Latino competition and that anti-Cuban attitudes will influence non-Cuban Hispanic voting. In Tampa, where non-Cuban Latinos live in communities where Cubans are not dominant, we expect lower levels of perceived competition and Cuban-related attitudes to be inconsequential to the vote. The results confirm that power relations in the local arena constitute an important influence on the political behavior of Latino immigrants.

T1  - Protestant work ethic's relation to intergroup and policy attitudes: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 1018342780; 201212787
AB  - The Protestant work ethic (PWE), the belief that hard work leads to success, is prevalent in many cultures and has been related to negative attitudes toward disadvantaged groups (prejudice) and social policies targeting them. Given recent theorizing and findings suggesting that PWE is not necessarily associated with prejudice among all people or in all contexts, this meta-analysis examined the direction and strength of PWE's relation to prejudice (37 eligible studies) and policy attitudes (16 studies) among published and unpublished studies across 38 years. Results revealed not only significant positive relationships between PWE and both types of intergroup attitudes but also significant moderators of these relationships. There were significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both prejudice and policy attitudes among samples in Western countries (Canada, England, New Zealand, USA), and marginally significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both types of attitudes the older the mean age of the sample (within Western countries). PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes also varied by the target group of the attitudes. Findings support a more nuanced view of PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes, suggesting that PWE does not always promote greater prejudice; rather its consequences are culture and context bound.

T1  - "My Life was Filled with Constant Anxiety": Anti-Immigrant Discrimination, Undocumented Status, and Their Mental Health Implications for Brazilian Immigrants
AN  - 894174172
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Mental Health              Immigration reform and the various costs associated with undocumented immigration have been in national headlines in the past few years. The growth of Latinos as the US' largest ethno-racial minority has sparked debates about the "browning" of the United States and led to an increase in anti-immigrant discrimination. While some researchers have documented the effects of racial discrimination on the mental health of ethno-racial minorities in the United States, less has explored how anti-immigrant discrimination and undocumented status influence the mental and psychological well-being of Latino immigrants, more specifically Brazilian immigrants, in the United States. Relying on data from in-depth interviews conducted with 49 Brazilian return migrants who immigrated to the United States and subsequently returned to Brazil, this paper will examine how their experiences living as racialized and primarily undocumented immigrants in the United States influenced their mental health. Specifically, I demonstrate that respondents experienced ethno-racial and anti-immigrant discrimination and endured various challenges that had negative implications for their mental health. This paper will also discuss additional factors that researchers should take into account when examining immigrants' mental health and the challenges immigrants encounter in a racialized society with increasing anti-immigrant sentiment.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Sword's Other Edge: Perceptions Of Discrimination And Racial Policy Opinion After Obama
AN  - 896169205; 201120530
AB  - This study explores the impact of a momentous political event, the election of the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, in 2008, on perceptions of racism and opinions about racial policy. A representative panel study of Americans interviewed immediately before and after the election reveals a roughly 10 percent decline in perceptions of racial discrimination. About one quarter of respondents revised their perceptions of discrimination downward. We explore several explanations for this decline. First, motivated-reasoning theory would predict larger declines among those whose priors tell them that racism was a diminished force to begin with. Second, changes could be concentrated among those who have the least contact with out-group members, or who are less knowledgeable about politics, and therefore weight Obama's victory heavily in deciding how much racism exists in America. Third, based on theories of emotion and cognition, anxiety but not anger before the election might trigger substantial updating of beliefs. We found the drop in perceived discrimination to be widespread across groups in the population, with conservatives but not necessarily racially resentful whites exhibiting somewhat larger declines. Residential racial context had no effect on changes in perception, though declines were larger among the least politically knowledgeable. More notably, those citizens anxious but not angry before the election displayed much larger declines in perceived discrimination. Finally, declines in perceived discrimination were associated with increases in negative opinions of blacks and heightened opposition to both affirmative action and immigration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Class, ethnicity, gender and Latino entrepreneurship
AN  - 887747560
AB  - For Salvadorans, strong communities characterized by ethnic cohesion and ethnic-based social capital are essential features that help establish Salvadoran entrepreneurship, especially in light of their lower class status and their culturally rooted distrust of market institutions, which hinder their access to class-based resources.  "Institutional gatekeepers" (169) confirm entrepreneurs' perception that structural opportunities and federal support for Latino small business is limited and generally ineffective; at the same time, government leaders and gatekeepers suggest that Latinos need stronger leaders and community organizers to combat the barriers to enterprise that Latinos face, which include the recent economic downturn of the economy and a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - New majorities' abuse of power: Effects of perceived control and social support
AN  - 1910239647
AB  - Two studies examined how new majorities (minorities-turned-majorities) abused power by claiming privileges (in-group favoritism) and disparaging new minorities (out-group hostility). Study 1 found that new majorities low in perceived control showed significantly more in-group favoritism than new majorities high in perceived control and stable majorities. The effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism was mediated by certainty about status stability. Study 2 replicated the effect of control on new majorities' in-group favoritism. In addition, Study 2 found that new majorities were most likely to engage in out-group hostility when they were low in perceived control and received social support for such discrimination. Our studies suggest that power abuse is most egregious among minorities who rise to majority status without a sense of control in the context where abuse is socially endorsed.

T1  - Integration, minorities and the rhetoric of civilization: the case of British Pakistani Muslims in the UK and Malay Muslims in Singapore
AN  - 1010631909; 201210557
AB  - This article discusses, through a comparative approach, the experience of young Muslims in Singapore and the UK as far as integration is concerned. The paper suggests that one of the main issues faced by young Muslims, in both countries, is how they are represented and understood. Indeed, British South Asian Muslims as well as Malay Muslim Singaporeans are still living in a dynamic of postcolonialism. The heritage of British colonialism still, although latently, works through the creation of categories and classifications of how identity should be defined. In both the cases of British South Asian Muslims and Singaporean Malay Muslims, there is often an unspoken request for the imagined ethnic minority to mimic the 'achiever' majority. It is in this dynamic that we can recognize what I have called a 'rhetoric of civilization'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cape Verdean Youth Fashion: Identity in Clothing
AN  - 881466666; 201116453
AB  - Through informal and formal interviewing, participant-observation, and textual analysis this article investigates popular, political, and economic meanings assigned to treatments of the body. More specifically, this article examines the ways in which Cape Verdean youth in the Greater Boston area construct individual and social identities via fashion, that is, it underscores fashion and clothing as an important social sphere of identity construction. It highlights a semiotic web and performative practices where local, national, and global identities are negotiated and constructed. To this end, it asks a series of questions about the commitments brought to notice by clothes and fashion. First, how important is fashion in the creation and maintenance of identity? Second, how does the powerful and hegemonic racial coding of clothes and style affect the use of clothing by Cape Verdean youth? Lastly, what do the clothes Cape Verdean youth wear say about who they are or who we think they are? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reexamining Racial Resentment: Conceptualization and Content
AN  - 1928618086
AB  - There is an ongoing debate in the racial attitudes literature about the degree to which new racism measures actually tap negative racial beliefs. Racial resentment is one construct that has been criticized on such grounds. To date, Kinder and Sanders (1996) have proposed the most commonly utilized measure of racial resentment, which is largely based on a similar construct--symbolic racism. The authors enter this discussion by proposing and testing an alternative racial resentment measure, one that is more explicit. They analyze data from two convenience samples of college students and from two national adult samples. They find the Explicit Racial Resentment (EXR) measure to have strong measurement properties and associations with known correlates of racial attitudes, suggesting promise as a survey-based indicator of underlying racial resentment.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity and Ethnic Strife. An Interdisciplinary Perspective
AN  - 856403638; 201106891
AB  - The objective of this paper is to present an overview of ethnicity, ethnic strife, and its consequences, as seen from the perspective of the disciplines of economics, political science, social anthropology, and sociology. What exactly is ethnicity-how is it to be defined, characterized, and measured? What exactly are the causal links from ethnicity so defined to its presumed consequences, including tension and violence? What are the feedback loops from the consequences of ethnic divisions back to these divisions themselves? How can policy, if at all, mitigate ethnic divisions and ethnic conflict? Finally, what role does interdisciplinarity have in helping to understand ethnicity and ethnic strife, and how can interdisciplinary collaboration be enhanced? These are the questions which this paper takes up and deals with in sequence. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Political Integration through Associational Affiliation? Immigrants and Native Swedes in Greater Stockholm
AN  - 862595880; 201109689
AB  - Theories of participation have been developed & tested almost exclusively on majority populations. While the relative under-representation of ethnic minorities in the political process is regularly asserted, their participatory behaviour is therefore generally less-well understood. Using recently gathered data based on a sample of residents in the region of Greater Stockholm, Sweden, this article considers two primary questions: whether associational affiliation increases individuals' likelihood of political participation & whether these effects are the same for immigrants & native Swedes. It is shown that associational affiliation lowers the thresholds of political participation for immigrants by offering a training ground for civic skills &, albeit of lesser importance, an arena for political recruitment. In contrast, the positive correlation between affiliation & political participation among native Swedes instead seems to stem from processes of self-selection. While associational affiliation thus seems to be an important means for the political integration of immigrants, the political importance of associational affiliation for the majority population may well be called in question.

T1  - Changing Boundaries of Ethnic Identity and Feelings Toward Ingroup/ Outgroup: Examining Taiwan Residents From a Psycho-Historical Perspective
AN  - 1928259053
AB  - Subjective group identification may not always be based on common biological origins or group salience, but rather, due to changes in group power. The present cross-temporal meta-analysis documents the transformation of Taiwan residents' identification as both Taiwanese and Chinese during recent decades, in which the legitimacy of Chinese power over Taiwan was changed. The relations between identification and feelings toward Taiwanese and Chinese were also examined. Results suggest that historical memories and the political ascendancy of Taiwanese culture, rather than relative size of groups, increased identification with Taiwanese over Chinese. Historical and ethnic differences are compared to address ingroup favoritism, outgroup derogation, and other issues in social identity theory.

T1  - The Level of Knowledge about Islam and Perception of Islam among Czech and Slovak University Students: does Ignorance Determine Subjective Attitudes?
AN  - 1417526802; 201333990
AB  - In this article, we examine existing levels of knowledge about Islam and other characteristics of respondents in regard to attitudes towards Islam and anti-Muslim prejudice. The analysis uses expectations derived from the integrated threat theory and inter-group contact theory when drawing on a questionnaire survey conducted among 716 university students interviewed in seven Czech and Slovak cities. Our results showed that the level of knowledge about Islam is negatively associated with perceived threats (such as fears of Islamic terrorism, and perception of problems with integration of Muslims into Czech/Slovak society) and, indirectly through the latter, with prejudice against Muslims. The analysis also confirmed some other (statistically more important) correlates of both perceived threats and anti-Muslim prejudice. These are personal contacts with Muslims and the Islamic world that are associated with more positive attitudes and affiliation to a church which is associated with more negative attitudes towards Islam.

T1  - Bulilima's "Look-South" Policy: Gender and Socio-Economic Implications
AN  - 1315599476; 201307631
AB  - People in the southern and western border districts of Zimbabwe have always looked South (Botswana and South Africa) for economic prosperity. Reasons for this include proximity, common languages, as well as historical and cultural ties with ethnic groups in the two neighbouring countries. This trend, herein referred to as 'Bulilima's look-south policy' continues to flourish despite the recently declared official national 'Look-east policy' by government in response to Western-imposed 'targeted' economic sanctions over the land seizures from former white commercial farmers in 2000. Although the country has experienced significant increase in cross-border trade as well as brain and brawn (muscle) drain, significant in Bulilima District is brawn drain. In fact, it would appear a man in Bulilima is not yet a man unless and until he has gone to settle and work either in South Africa or Botswana. This southward drift has actually become an initiation ceremony for the district's youth and has reduced it into a district of children, women and the elderly. This study sought to assess the nature, socio-economic and gender implications of this southward flow for the south-western district of Bulilima near the border town of Plumtree. It also sought to identify the most mobile groups as well as specific reasons for migrating down south. The research applies a case study approach. Questionnaires, in-depth interviews, informal discussions as well as observations were used to solicit information from respondents. Systematic sampling was used to select questionnaire respondents while chiefs, school heads and nursing sisters at clinics/hospitals were subjects for interviews. Results show that males migrate more than women and that there was even a marked increase in the number of emigrants in the first decade of 2000 because of the dire socio-economic conditions prevalent in the country then. This southward migration has resulted in both negative and positive socioeconomic implications in the district. It has also seen a shift in gender roles whereby some roles, traditionally identified with a specific sex, are now done by both sexes. The study recommends that the export processing zone status of Plumtree town as well as the dollarization of the economy be used to harness this labour flight. It also recommends that a Bulilima District Association be formed by the emigrants (njivas) to help develop their district, and sensitization programmes on issues of health, children and women's rights be initiated.

T1  - Entrapping Christian and Muslim Arabs in Racial Cartoons in Australia: The Other Anti-Semitism
AN  - 852899928; 201103160
AB  - Racial Cartoons are a powerful force disguised as entertainment operating to shape public opinion. During the 1980s, 1990s and after 9/11 in 2001, cartoons in the Australian press were particularly directed against Muslim and Christian Arabs without remorse or fear of redress or accountability. The offensive of such cartoons has essentially been directed on three fronts-oil, politics and religion. The drawback resulting from socio-cultural, historical and other differences are no doubt visible; but equally obvious is that anti-Semitism, which was directed against the Jews in the 1930s and 1940s, is today mostly directed against the public relations deprived, opinion silenced and undemocratically governed, ethnically diverse Arabs. It is argued in this paper that several forces were behind such distorted visual strategies adopted by the Australian press. Pre-judgement stemming from an inbuilt bias of the cartoonist, or highlighting characteristics which conform to the national interest are likely factors. The debate in Australia as to whether public images and attitudes of a minority 'cause' or 'determine' policy or whether policy itself changes attitudes is still resting with the jury.

T1  - 'There's One Shop You Don't Go Into If You Are English': The Social and Political Integration of English Migrants into Wales
AN  - 818802372; 201071773
AB  - Research into ethnic minorities in Wales has gathered pace in recent years. Yet little is known about Wales' largest ethnic group, the English, although the Welsh-English boundary remains the main marker of ethnic distinction, and migration into Wales from England represents a continuing challenge to the maintenance of distinctive 'Welshness'-including Welsh language and associated culture. Evidence from a study of English migrants into selected communities in North-West Wales throws light on the characteristics of a previously neglected 'dominant minority' and is used to assess the extent to which some of the most-frequently voiced criticisms of migrants' attitudes and impact correspond to their own perceptions and evaluations of the inmigrant experience. The majority of migrants are shown to be attempting to integrate into Welsh life, socially and politically, but a minority express awareness of lines of ethnic tension and division.

T1  - Media framing of proposed nuclear reactors: An analysis of print media
AN  - 764417453; 201064623
AB  - Nuclear energy has received substantial recent attention, marketed as a 'green' solution to global climate change (GCC) with calls for new reactors. However, considerable debate exists about whether it represents a viable solution to GCC. Given the complexity and urgency of the issue, a full and balanced debate is desirable. Since media play an important role in shaping public perception, we examined print media coverage of proposed reactors in Georgia-one site in the southeastern United States, which has been the focus of such proposals. We analysed the content of editorials and news articles from two local newspapers-the Augusta Chronicle and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The former exclusively published pro-nuclear opinion pieces whereas the latter published a mix of pro- and anti-nuclear opinions. The majority of news articles in both newspapers generally presented balanced arguments. Pro- and anti-nuclear arguments most often reflected economic and environmental benefits and risks, whereas informational text primarily detailed regulatory processes and financing. Findings suggested that informational text was not necessarily 'neutral', sometimes masking covert pro- and anti-nuclear content. Implications for how findings might shape public opinion and strategies for shaping media and extending public deliberation are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Evolution of Ethnic Enclaves in the Toronto Metropolitan Area, 2001--2006
AN  - 754041850; 201053382
AB  - How do ethnic enclaves grow and change over time? This question is addressed by a longitudinal analysis of the geography of ethnic enclaves in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area over the period 2001--2006. The analysis shows that the enclaves in the Toronto area are continually realigning, their centres of gravity shifting and their contours changing. Usually, in an enclave, an axis or band of high-ethnic-density territories is formed, surrounded by zones of lower ethnic concentrations. Enclaves of groups with high levels of immigration from South Asia and China have been expanding, whilst those of earlier waves of immigrants--Jews, Portuguese and Italians--show tendencies towards consolidation and contraction. The emergence of ethnic institutions and services keeps enclaves thriving. Today, enclaves are largely in suburban areas where homeownership rates are high and new housing has been built. In the Toronto area enclaves, particular ethnic groups are demographically dominant without being a majority. Other ethnic groups have a sizable presence in these enclaves.

T1  - Self-Protective Biases in Group Categorization: Threat Cues Shape the Psychological Boundary Between 'Us' and 'Them'
AN  - 754038861; 201049633
AB  - Across 6 studies, factors signaling potential vulnerability to harm produced a bias toward outgroup categorization-a tendency to categorize unfamiliar others as members of an outgroup rather than as members of one's ingroup. Studies 1 through 4 demonstrated that White participants were more likely to categorize targets as Black (as opposed to White) when those targets displayed cues heuristically associated with threat (masculinity, movement toward the perceiver, and facial expressions of anger). In Study 5, White participants who felt chronically vulnerable to interpersonal threats responded to a fear manipulation by categorizing threatening (angry) faces as Black rather than White. Study 6 extended these findings to a minimal group paradigm, in which participants who felt chronically vulnerable to interpersonal threats categorized threatening (masculine) targets as outgroup members. Together, findings indicate that ecologically relevant threat cues within both the target and the perceiver interact to bias the way people initially parse the social world into ingroup vs. outgroup. Findings support a threat-based framework for intergroup psychology. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Ethnic diversity and statistics in East Asia: 'foreign brides' surveys in Taiwan and South Korea
AN  - 743065749; 201043197
AB  - East Asian nations have become increasingly diverse in their ethnic composition since the 1990s. A large proportion of recent immigrants consists of women from China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, who migrated following their marriage to male citizens from South Korea and Taiwan. To study this new group of foreign residents, the governments of both Taiwan and South Korea have conducted national surveys since 2000. This paper conducts a content analysis of the questions of these surveys to elaborate a criticism of the ethnic statistics produced from them. These surveys provide relevant information on this group of new residents, but they also have the potential to reinforce existing negative stereotypes due to prior assumptions that shaped the content of questionnaires. The analysis reveals that the production of statistics on migrants is influenced by three ideologies: assimilation, patriarchy and nationalism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social networks and identity negotiations of religious minority youth in diverse social contexts
AN  - 743066622; 201043294
AB  - This study is looking at how youth growing up in families affiliated with a religious minority negotiate their religious values and social identity in the social contexts of minority and majority. Although these youth belong to the ethnic majority in Finland, the religious and lifestyle values of their home and religious community differ from the Lutheran mainstream, which causes discrepancies between the values of their socialization background and those of their peer group. The negotiations of values and identities are here examined through two case examples of the teenagers' interview data. These examples illustrate the varied strategies for negotiation, positive versus negative experiences on the acquired negotiation outcomes, as well as the diversity within a minority community and the different ways of being a member of a religious minority. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transgender as Ingroup or Outgroup? Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Viewers Respond to a Transgender Character in Daytime Television
AN  - 743047640; 201031745
AB  - From November 2006 to April 2007, the daytime drama All My Children featured Zoe, the first transitioning transgender character on broadcast television. Acknowledging historical tension within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community over transgender acceptance, this study examines how lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) viewers of All My Children reacted to this character. LGB viewers were more likely to dislike the character than non-LGB viewers, yet were also more trans-supportive than non-LGB viewers. Further evaluation suggests LGB viewers' negative response to Zoe was tied not to the transgender status of the character but specifically to unhappiness with a plot development seen to threaten the identity of the lesbian character, Bianca. Applications of social identity theory and implications for community politics are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity in the person, diversity in the group: Challenges of identity complexity for social perception and social interaction
AN  - 60396957; 201017393
AB  - Social psychological research is increasingly coming to grips with the complexity of social identity within the individual, both from the perspective of perceivers trying to form impressions and make judgments about multiply categorizable targets, as well as from the perspective of actors using their different self-aspects as a framework for guiding their interactions with the social world. I review several contributions to the effort to better understand these issues and then explore some of their possible implications for understanding the nature and consequences of diversity within the group.
