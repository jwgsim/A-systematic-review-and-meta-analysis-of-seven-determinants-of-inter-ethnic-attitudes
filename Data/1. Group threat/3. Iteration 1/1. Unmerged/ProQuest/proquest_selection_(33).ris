T1  - This Land Is (Not) Your Land: Race and Ascripted Americanness in the Formation of Attitudes about Immigrants
AN  - 2627320351
AB  - Race consistently patterns anti-immigrant bias. However, it is less clear if all racial groups define “being American” in the same way. This work explores the ways ascribed characteristics that define being “American,” termed Ascripted Americanness, potentially contributes to racial variation in attitudes toward immigrants. Using the 2004 & 2014 General Social Survey (n = 1,774), results show that emphasizing any facet of Ascripted Americanness, particularly US ancestry, correlates to anti-immigrant hostility. Furthermore, the connection between Ascripted Americanness and hostility tends to be more pronounced for white adults compared to black or Latinx adults. Ultimately, these findings reveal that hostility toward immigrants is shaped by the racialization of symbolic boundaries around “being American.”

T1  - The Rise and Fall of Japan’s New Far Right: How Anti-Korean Discourses Went Mainstream*
AN  - 2557394767
AB  - Why has right-wing activism in Japan, despite its persistence throughout the postwar era, only gained significant traction recently? Focusing on the Zaitokukai, an anti-Korean movement in Japan, this article demonstrates how the new Far Right were able to popularize formerly stigmatized right-wing ideas. The Zaitokukai represents a political group distinct from the traditional right and reflective of new Far Right movements spreading worldwide. In Japan, concerns about the growing influence of South Korea and China in the 1980s as well as the decline of left-wing norms opened up a discursive opportunity for the new Far Right. By framing Korean postcolonial minorities as undeserving recipients of social welfare benefits, the Zaitokukai mobilized perceptions of threat that has continued to powerfully influence public perceptions of Koreans even following the group’s organizational decline. While past research has focused on the new Far Right’s political influence, this article stresses their roles as ideological entrepreneurs.

T1  - The public's dilemma: race and political evaluations of police killings
AN  - 2571104056
AB  - This paper explores perceptions of the killings of African-Americans by police officers. We show how characteristics of the victim, officer and surrounding environment, as well as political cues, shape such perceptions. In the first study, we employ a conjoint survey experiment, wherein subjects are exposed to descriptions of hypothetical police killings. Focusing on subjects who score high on the Symbolic Racism Scale (SRS), we identify what leads such subjects to view shootings as more justified. We replicate and extend these effects in a second study in which subjects read fictitious newspaper articles. We find that exposing high SRS subjects to primes related to Black Lives Matter can decrease their belief in shootings' justifiability.

T1  - Reflection on student drop-out against the backdrop of COVID-19 in the South African Educational context amongst marginalised groups of students
AN  - 2603456395
AB  - The extant literature has previously shown that attitude towards homeownership and pressure from reference groups may significantly affect individual's homeownership intention especially in many western societies. The authors assumed that Nigerian citizens might also have similar experience especially for non-indigenes living and working in states in geo-political zones outside their own ethnic areas. The study surveyed 300 members of Igbo ethnic group residents in Ilorin metropolis. Simple random sampling method was adopted and data was gathered through structured questionnaire. The authors questioned participants about their attitude and intention towards owning personal home in the city. They also asked participants to relate to questions about the perceived easiness to acquire properties for personal use in the city and about the social (families' and relatives') pressure on their homeownership intention. Analytical techniques include simple frequency and percentage distributions, pearson chi-square and independent t-test. Research findings show that while many sampled participants have positive attitude towards homeownership in Ilorin, length of stay in the city, level of education and the perceived control affect homeownership intention among the participants. A surprising result was that subjective norms appear to exert little or no influence on participants' homeownership intention. Hence, the finding demonstrates the interactive nature of social influence/personal norms dimension in homeownership through availability of and access to information and sources of homeownership funding.Alternate abstract:La littérature existante a déjà montré que l'attitude envers l'accession à la propriété et la pression des groupes de référence peuvent affecter de manière significative l'intention d'accession à la propriété d'un individu, en particulier dans de nombreuses sociétés occidentales. Les auteurs ont supposé que les citoyens nigérians pourraient également avoir une expérience similaire, en particulier pour les non-indigènes vivant et travaillant dans des États situés dans des zones géopolitiques en dehors de leurs propres zones ethniques. L'étude a interrogé 300 membres du groupe ethnique Igbo résidant dans la métropole d'Ilorin. Une méthode d'échantillonnage aléatoire simple a été adoptée et les données ont été recueillies au moyen d'un questionnaire structuré. Les auteurs ont interrogé les participants sur leur attitude et leur intention de posséder une maison personnelle dans la ville. Ils ont également demandé aux participants de se rapporter à des questions sur la facilité perçue d'acquérir des propriétés à usage personnel dans la ville et sur la pression sociale (familles et proches) sur leur intention d'accession à la propriété. Les techniques analytiques comprennent des distributions simples de fréquence et de pourcentage, le chi carré de Pearson et le test t indépendant. Les résultats de la recherche montrent que si de nombreux participants échantillonnés ont une attitude positive envers l'accession à la propriété à Ilorin, la durée du séjour dans la ville, le niveau d'éducation et le contrôle perçu affectent l'intention d'accession à la propriété chez les participants. Un résultat surprenant est que les normes subjectives semblent exercer peu ou pas d'influence sur l'intention des participants d'accéder à la propriété. Par conséquent, les résultats démontrent la nature interactive de la dimension influence sociale/normes personnelles dans l'accession à la propriété grâce à la disponibilité et à l'accès à l'information et aux sources de financement pour l'accession à la propriété

T1  - The Influence of Media Portrayals of Immigration and Refugees on Consumer Attitudes: A Experimental Design
AN  - 2441231261
AB  - The current study examined media portrayals of immigrants and refugees and participants attitudes regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia using an experimental design. Participants included 284 male and female college students who were primed with negative, positive, or no media portrayals of immigrants and refugees prior to completing questionnaires related to their views regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia. It was hypothesized that there would be differences in participants attitudes based on experimental condition, with participants exposed to negative portrayals reporting more negative attitudes compared to the other experimental conditions. Factors related to participant susceptibility to media portrayals were also examined and were hypothesized to include participant age, race, biological sex, social class, and political and religious affiliation. Significant differences were found based on experimental condition for viewing immigration as an economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity threat as well as physical benefits of immigration, intolerant attitudes toward immigrants, and affective-behavioral and cognitive Islamophobia. Participants who were primed with negative media portrayals reported more negative attitudes. In addition, biological sex, race, social class, and political and religious affiliation were found to relate to participant susceptibility to media portrayals of immigration and refugees. Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Making community under shared conditions of insecurity: the negotiation of ethnic borders in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile
AN  - 2430674544
AB  - Multicultural commercial neighbourhoods are key spaces where individuals learn to relate to cultural difference in increasingly diverse cities worldwide. Host countries’ pre-existing social dynamics and environmental conditions mutually shape everyday interactions between people from different ethnonational backgrounds within specific spaces. This article examines two kinds of community-making practices consisting of both intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic exchanges and collaborations, under conditions of shared insecurity in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile. Drawing on ethnic Chinese experiences and responses to crime, we discuss how inhabitants of multicultural sites create more hospitable spaces by building and overcoming boundaries with co-ethnics, other migrants and ‘locals’. Our ethnographic study finds that Chinese residents engaged in what we term ‘strategic ethnic groupism’, which aims to prompt the solidarity of an ‘ethnic-based’ collective in order to politically organise towards long-term solutions. Yet, simultaneously, with other migrants and citizens, the Chinese negotiated everyday intercultural conviviality through creating relations of trust and care to address more immediate insecurity concerns. Discussing both strategies, this article contributes to understanding the productive frictions between ethnicity, community and belonging, under shared conditions of insecurity, in multicultural urban spaces.

T1  - Identity, Couple and Intergroup Dynamics in Intercultural Families: Implications on Life Satisfaction of Partners
AN  - 2410525166
AB  - The current study analyzed how identity, couple, and intergroup dynamics are related to life satisfaction among 210 intercultural partners living in Italy. Three levels of analysis were considered: a micro level, taking into account the identity aspect of each partner in terms of self‐ or hetero‐ethnic identification; a meso level, examining the passion, commitment, and intimacy of the couple sphere of the partners; a macro level investigating the discrimination that partners can perceive by the community as an effect of the relationship between dominant and minority groups. The results show that for both partners, foreign and Italian, the variables that have a predictive value on life satisfaction bring into play the couple and the intergroup dynamics, leaving out the identitary one. Specifically, increased perceived discrimination as a member of a mixed couple leads to decreased life satisfaction by partners. In turn, we can see that a strong intimacy between partners enhances their life satisfaction. These results introduce a reflection on the role of the differences about the ethnic identity, considered erroneously the main cause of dissatisfaction in the mixed couple. The implications of the study are described and suggestions for future research discussed.Alternate abstract:El presente estudio analizó cómo la dinámica de la identidad, de la pareja e intergrupal está relacionada con la satisfacción con la vida entre 210 integrantes de parejas interculturales que viven en Italia. Se consideraron tres niveles de análisis: un nivel micro, que tiene en cuenta el aspecto de la identidad de cada integrante de la pareja en cuanto a la autoidentificación étnica o la héteroidentificación étnica; un nivel meso, que analiza la pasión, el compromiso y la intimidad en el ámbito de pareja de los integrantes de la pareja; un nivel macro que investiga la discriminación que los integrantes de la pareja pueden percibir de la comunidad como consecuencia de la relación entre grupos dominantes y minoritarios. Los resultados demuestran que para ambos integrantes de la pareja, extranjero e italiano, las variables que tienen un valor predictivo sobre la satisfacción con la vida ponen en juego la dinámica de pareja e intergrupal, excluyendo la de identidad. Específicamente, una mayor discriminación percibida como integrante de una pareja interracial conduce a una menor satisfacción con la vida por parte de los integrantes de la pareja. A su vez, podemos obsevar que una intimidad profunda entre los integrantes de la pareja mejora su satisfacción con la vida. Estos resultados presentan una reflexión sobre el papel que juegan las diferencias con respecto a la identidad étnica, considerada erróneamente la causa principal de insatisfacción en la pareja interracial. Se describen las implicancias del estudio y se debaten sugerencias para investigaciones futuras.Alternate abstract:本研究针对生活在意大利的210对跨文化的伴侣,考察了身份,双方互动和族群之间的互动对生活满意度的影响。一共进行了三个层面的分析:微观层面的,考虑到每个伴侣的身份,自我认同,和异性恋认同;中间层面考察热情,效忠度,伴侣之间的亲密程度;宏观层面考察对伴侣的歧视,通过主流族裔和少数族裔的关系的效果来看伴侣所在的社群。结果显示,对伴侣双方,不管来自意大利国之外的和意大利的,这些变量对生活的满意度有一个预测作用, 他们对伴侣之间的互动和族群之间的互动会起作用,除了身份那个。具体而言就是可观察到的歧视情况越多,一对跨国伴侣就会因为对方的行为而降低生活的满意度。与之相反,如果伴侣之间的亲密程度高,生活的满意度也会高。这些结果可以引导对种族身份的差异所起作用进行反思,以及它被错误地认为是在跨国伴侣中的不满意的主要成因。本研究的暗含意义和对未来研究的建议都有讨论。.

T1  - Class Background, Reception Context, and Intergenerational Mobility: A Record Linkage and Surname Analysis of the Children of Irish Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 2369764507
AB  - Proponents of restrictive immigration policies often claim that families arriving with fewer skills and resources will struggle economically. This claim is challenging to test as lower-skilled migrants also tend to face greater discrimination, exclusion, and obstacles in the United States. I use unique multigenerational data on Irish Americans in the early-twentieth century, before and after migration, to directly study how the economic origins of Irish families and the reception context they faced in the United States affected economic attainment in the second generation. This analysis finds weak associations between economic background in Ireland and second-generation earnings in the United States. The schooling context and ethnic communities of settlement locations in the United States, in contrast, have strong effects on the second generation. These findings indicate that the experiences of immigrant families in the United States may be more important for second-generation attainment than the skills and resources brought from the origin country in the immigrant generation.

T1  - The impact of biological and cultural racisms on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration public policies
AN  - 2376776197
AB  - Based on ESS-7 data, this paper focuses on two attitudinal dimensions about public policies related to immigration: how many can come and who can come. In this context, the hypothesis concerning the bi-dimensionality of racism was supported and, as predicted, biological racism is more anti-normative than cultural racism. Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy. Results are discussed within the context of racism theories as a bi-dimensional concept and in the framework of the role of legitimation processes in social discrimination.

T1  - Earthquake Impacts on Immigrant Participation in the Greater Christchurch Construction Labor Market
AN  - 2126733620
AB  - Post natural disaster immigration has potential to significantly impact labor markets, possibly affecting local workers’ employment opportunities and thereby community recovery. However, research is limited. This study examines the impacts of the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes on demographic composition and occupational structure in the Greater Christchurch construction industry using customized data from New Zealand Census of Populations and Dwellings conducted in 2006 and 2013. Replication of the discrete dependent variable regression methods used by Sisk and Bankston III (Popul Res Policy Rev 33(3):309–334, 2014) enables comparison with outcomes in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. The increased presence of migrant construction workers did not reduce employment of New Zealand-born workers, both non-immigrant and immigrant participation in the construction industry increased post-earthquakes. After the earthquakes, there was increased worker participation at the lowest-skill end of the occupational structure, but there were few significant changes in occupational distributions of non-immigrant and immigrant workers. Non-immigrant workers still dominated all occupational levels post-earthquakes. Construction workers’ education levels were higher post-earthquakes, particularly among migrant workers. Overall, migrant workers in the Greater Christchurch construction industry were more diverse, better educated, and participated at higher occupational levels than migrants assisting in the New Orleans rebuild, possibly due to differences in immigration policies.

T1  - Social psychological research on prejudice as collective action supporting emergent ingroup members
AN  - 2162391435
AB  - Why does social psychological research on prejudice change across time? We argue that scientific change is not simply a result of empirical evidence, technological developments, or social controversies, but rather emerges out of social change‐driven shifts in how researchers categorize themselves and others within their larger societies. As mainstream researchers increasingly recategorize former outgroup members as part of a novel ingroup, prejudice research shifts in support of emergent ingroup members against their emergent outgroup opponents. Although social change‐driven science results in valuable opportunities for researchers, it also results in significant risks for research – collective, scientific biases in the inclusion and exclusion of social groups in prejudice research that are not readily detected or managed by traditional controls. We present the Emergent Ingroup Model (EIM) to encourage reflection on shared biases, as well as to spark a broader conversation on how to strengthen our field for a rapidly changing and increasingly global world.

T1  - On the Structure of Subalternity and the Process of Subalternisation in India
AN  - 1941602286
AB  - The concept of subalternity, originally formulated by the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, was amplified by a few Indian historians by juxtaposing the elitist nationalist historiography with subaltern historiography providing a bottom-up perspective. This paper attempts to identify the structure of subaltern deprivations with special reference to India. The main sources of subalternisation in India are as follows: treating some groups/communities as outsiders to the polity (externalisation); assigning groups to the lowest rung of the social ladder (hierarchisation); denial of identity to some groups through a process of absorption (expansionism of the hegemonic group) and lastly, application of traditional norms of society to keep women in subordination (patriarchy). The groups/communities subjected to the process of subalternisation in contemporary India are dalits, adivasis, religious and linguistic minorities and women. Admittedly, the phenomenon of intersectionality creates a hierarchy among subaltern groups--some are cumulatively oppressed, based on several factors, while the oppression of others is anchored in one or two factors only.

T1  - Exploring the Mother-Adolescent Relationship as a Promotive Resource for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth
AN  - 1940969148
AB  - Research often analyzes gender minority youth and sexual minority youth as a single group, a practice that obscures differences in how gender identity and sexual orientation shape health. The present study uses intersectionality to explore similarities and differences in the relationships between minority stress theory variables in a sample of 28 gender minority and 135 sexual minority youth of color. We also explore the mother-adolescent relationship as a potential promotive resource for minority stress research with youth. Results find few differences in minority stressors, promotive resources, or health between sexual and gender minority youth. However, different patterns in the correlations between stressors, resources, and health were observed for each group, underscoring the need for researchers to consider sexual and gender minority youth as distinct groups. Furthermore, study findings suggest that the maternal relationship may be an important promotive resource for both sexual and gender minority youth.

T1  - "La beauté est dans la rue": Four reasons (or perhaps five) to study crowds: GPIR
AN  - 1932684507
AB  - In this paper, I argue that the study of crowds provides important lessons for social psychology in four key areas. First, it reveals the political influences which shaped and continue to shape the questions we ask and the answers we provide. Second, it demonstrates the importance of a methodological strategy which attends to real-world phenomena and the ability of theory to make sense of them. Third, it generates new theoretical insights and conceptual paradigms which have relevance to social psychology in general. Fourth, it provides new insights into the way that the social relations which constitute everyday social reality are created, consolidated, and changed. In sum, I suggest that the crowd is uniquely fertile ground in which to investigate the subject matter of social psychology.

T1  - Groupism and the politics of indigeneity: A case study on the Sámi debate in Finland
AN  - 1923538193
AB  - The article addresses the problems of defining an indigenous people by deconstructing the Sámi debate in Finland, which has escalated with the government's commitment to ratify ILO Convention No. 169. We argue that the ethnopolitical conflict engendered by this commitment is a consequence of groupism, by which, following Rogers Brubaker, we mean the tendency to take discrete groups as chief protagonists of social conflicts, the tendency to treat ethnic groups, nations and races as substantial entities and the tendency to reify such groups as if they were unitary collective actors. The aim of the article is to deconstruct groupist thinking related to indigenous rights by analytically separating the concepts of group and category. This allows us to deconstruct the ethnicised conflict and analyse what kinds of political, social and cultural aspects are involved in it. We conclude that indigeneity is not an ethnocultural, objectively existing fact, but rather a frame of political requirements.

T1  - Migrants' Intention to Move or Stay in their Initial Destination
AN  - 1897632337
AB  - The objective of this article is to find out why immigrants intend to stay in or leave their initial destination. The insight into such factors could help develop policy measures to deal with potential out-migration, especially from the regions that view international migration as a solution to their demographic and economic difficulties. The study uses multinomial logistic regression to estimate the strength of association between migrants' intention to move and immigration category, human capital, economic and social factors. The data come from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia. The findings show that different groups of migrants have different propensities to move or stay in their initial destination. Employer-sponsored migrants are even less likely to intend to relocate than family class. Highly educated and skilled migrants tend to be more likely to express the intention to move or have doubts. Satisfactory employment has a positive impact on retention.

T1  - College Students, Sexualities Identities, and Participation in Political Marches
AN  - 1883505337
AB  - Student protest is often an engine of social change for sexual minorities and other oppressed groups. Through an analysis of college students in the Add Health survey (n=2,534), we found that sexual minorities attend more political marches than heterosexuals. To understand why this sexuality difference occurs, we performed a logistic regression analysis to decipher the importance of four explanations: essentialism, selection, embeddedness, and conversion. We discovered that participation in political groups is the best explanation of the sexuality gap in activism, but racial attitudes were also important. Type of college major was generally connected to student activism, but educational attainment and disciplinary curriculums did not explain the increased activism of sexual minorities.

T1  - Through the Looking Glass: White First-year University Students' Observations of Racism in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada
AN  - 1888628531
AB  - Despite the growing interest in microaggression theory (Sue et al. ), little research has been conducted on it through a sociological lens. In fact, the psychological research that does exist has been from the United States (Constantine ; Mercer et al. ; Ong et al. ; Sue et al. ) and Canada (Hernandez ; Houshmand ), focusing primarily on minorities. One area that remains unexplored is white observations of racism. This is especially relevant given that Sue et al. contend that it is those who are most disempowered rather than those who enjoy the privileges of power who are likely to accurately assess whether a racist act has occurred. With this view in mind, this article utilizes racial microaggression theory to investigate the observations of racism among a cohort of approximately 170 white freshman (i.e., first-year) university students in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. As this research is Canadian based, it presents an excellent opportunity to advance racial microaggression theory from an international perspective. The goal of this article then is to categorize white youths' observations of microaggressions in order to discuss and analyze their impact on minorities living in a highly homogeneous, white-dominated space.

T1  - Introduction: Religion and public life
AN  - 1891806457
AB  - Political debate about the place of religion and religious identities in liberal democracies is as vigorous as ever, as evidenced by Christians' assertiveness against what they regard as secularising tendencies and the attempt to eliminate their established place in public life, as well as religious minorities seeking to combat their often marginalised position and the specific injustices to which they are subject (such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia). The papers in this collection aim to address these and similar issues, and to offer novel and fresh perspectives on some of the key themes and debates on religion and public life in contemporary political theory. In this introductory essay, we illustrate, first, the key elements of four contemporary debates on religion and public life which are explored in the articles that follow. These are the conflict between secularism and religious establishment, public reason and the use of religious arguments in public deliberation, the accommodation of religious beliefs, and the relationship between freedom of speech and religion. After surveying these debates we end with an overview of the essays in this special issue.

T1  - From diversity to conviviality: intra-EU mobility and international migration to Denmark in times of economic recession
AN  - 1869136048
AB  - This article explores differences among EU and non-EU migrants in accommodating to the Danish flexicurity labour and welfare regime during times of economic crisis. We build our findings on a quantitative survey followed by semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with EU and non-EU migrants who moved to Denmark during the recession period (2008-2013). We argue that the lack of multicultural policies triggers individualised strategies of accommodation rather than ethnic or national group base integration, favouring a more homogenous group of high-skilled and educated group of workers and students of postgraduate/higher education, whom we describe as a 'flexicurity diversity group'. Through patterns of conviviality, individual socialisation is based here on common interests, needs and lifestyles and not on pre-defined ethnic and/or cultural traits. The transition from diversity to conviviality that is initiated by this group remains however incomplete in light of the unequal opportunities and the differentiated scheme of rights that apply to EU and non-EU immigrants. Danish flexicurity has thus not had the desired inclusive effects but discriminates in terms of facilitating easy access to the labour market for all, and 'securing' social benefits and offering rights and protection only to the privileged group of EU migrants.

T1  - Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Rape Myth Acceptance: Preliminary Findings From a Sample of Primarily LGBQ-Identified Survey Respondents
AN  - 1883087401
AB  - This study is among the first to examine the relationship between sexual orientation and rape myth adherence using a nationwide survey of primarily lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) respondents (n = 184). The more established Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale and a modified Male Rape Survey serve as the primary instruments to test both rape myth adherence and instrument-appropriateness. Results suggest that respondents were most likely to support myths that discredit sexual assault allegations or excuse rape as a biological imperative and least likely to support myths related to physical resistance. Consistent with previous work, men exhibited higher levels of rape myth adherence than women. Regarding sexual orientation, respondents who identified as queer consistently exhibited lower levels of rape myth adherence than respondents who identified as gay.

T1  - Competition and intergroup bias: Toward a new construal process framework distinguishing competitive perceptions from competitive motivations: GPIR
AN  - 1830218153
AB  - Research on the effects of intergroup competition has relied on various conceptual approaches and has produced inconsistent findings. Following a review of the intergroup competition literature, we propose a framework which emphasizes that the influence of intergroup competition varies primarily according to participants' construal of potentially competitive events. We assess this via two variables: competitive intergroup perceptions (CIP), the perception that one's ingroup and another group(s) in the current situation are attempting to gain a reward at each other's expense; and competitive intergroup motivations (CIM), the individual desire for one's group to do better or acquire more of a reward than the other group(s). In four studies that presented participants with an ambiguously competitive intergroup setting and administered CIP and CIM scales adapted for the context, both variables were empirically nonredundant (Studies 1-4) and showed unique relations with intergroup outcomes: CIM, rather than CIP, was directly associated with greater intergroup bias (Studies 2-4), discriminatory intentions (Study 3), and discriminatory behavior (Study 4). CIP consistently registered an indirect effect on intergroup bias and behavior through CIM. Our results suggest that in ambiguous group contexts, CIM facilitates the pursuit of goals for the ingroup, which may involve expressing intergroup bias and more antisocial outgroup behavior, and that these tendencies are quite sensitive to corresponding changes in CIP. The current framework offers more precise insights into the influence of competitive group dynamics, and can easily be integrated with other research paradigms to determine how and when intergroup competition produces intergroup bias and discrimination.

T1  - Who do migrant associations represent? The role of 'ethnic deservingness' and legal capital in migrants' rights claims in Turkey
AN  - 1814221847
AB  - Considering that established migrant associations often play an active role in migrants' rights advocacy, the relationship between them and the growing numbers of irregular migrants needs careful scrutiny. Looking at the encounters between irregular Bulgarian Turkish migrants and associations established by their co-ethnics who hold Turkish citizenship in Turkey, our ethnographic evidence shows that co-ethnic migrant associations mobilise the legal frame of 'ethnic deservingness' with the intention of welcoming co-ethnics to the Turkish homeland. In the absence of other formal organisations for rights advocacy, associations' appeals to this frame emerge as a civic resource for the irregular newcomers in their permanent residency claims. At the same time, the same frame hides unequal power relations within co-ethnic communities, that is, newcomers' peripheral positions within associations and the economic costs of filing claims via associations. This situation creates a representational gap in the associational context between its active members with higher legal capital and irregular newcomers with lower legal capital. Tackling the problem of representation determined by the legal hierarchy, this study questions whether migrant associations should still be considered important political actors when undocumented/irregular migrants outnumber regulars-especially with regard to the immediate political/legal actions they require.

T1  - The Departed
AN  - 1837058195
AB  - This article explores the impact of the 2007 recession and immigration enforcement policies on Latin American immigrants' out-migration from the Durham, North Carolina, area--a new immigrant destination. Drawing on an original ethnosurvey collected in 2011, the analysis assesses the extent of out-migration over time, what precipitated the move, and whether individuals returned to their country of origin or migrated within the United States. We find that out-migration more than doubled after the 2007 recession and that migrants overwhelmingly returned to their home countries. While family considerations and accidents accounted for most of the departures before the recession, economic considerations became the dominant drivers of out-migration after 2007. Deportations also grew in number but accounted for a negligible share of all out-migration. Departures were more prevalent among immigrants from Mexico and those with lower educational attainment. Latin American migration, especially from Mexico, continues to be circular, and deportation is a relatively ineffective strategy for immigrant population control when compared to voluntary returns.

T1  - Does Cultural Recognition Obstruct Immigrant Integration? Evidence From Two Historic Case Studies: IMR
AN  - 1797820191
AB  - Is multiculturalism compatible with immigrant integration? While effects of minority rights and cultural recognition are controversial, I argue that not only the analysis of multicultural policies in their interaction with other structures and policies deserves more attention, but also that a historical discussion may inform current debates. Comparing and analyzing the French Huguenots in Brandenburg-Prussia (1685-1809) and Germans in the Volga region (1764-1878), I find that incorporation outcomes, despite similarly extensive cultural rights, are driven by differing opportunity structures. These findings contribute to the growing literature on multiculturalism in Europe and advocate a new approach to its analysis.

T1  - Resistance and Assimilation: Transforming Security Roles of China's Largest Muslim Minorities
AN  - 1797942190
AB  - China's resurgence as an economic power has brought it increased interconnectivity to international global markets, and with it, increased exposure to transnational crimes. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the resulting increase in religious-inspired terrorist attacks have been of particular concern for the Chinese leadership. This paper aims to highlight the processes of resistance and assimilation of China's two largest Muslim minorities, the Hui and Uyghur, in successive Chinese Empires since the eighth century CE and how critical events in the past two decades have affected the way in which the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has approached relations with its Muslim minority communities. The purpose is two-fold: to expose these groups' stabilizing and destabilizing influence throughout the 1300 years of Muslim-Chinese coexistence, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Party's Policies towards its Muslim minorities.

T1  - The Inner Geographies of a Migrant Gateway: Mapping the Built Environment and the Dynamics of Caribbean Mobility in Manchester, 1951-2011
AN  - 1778950102
AB  - Between the 1960s and 1990s a series of urban redevelopment projects in Manchester radically transformed ethnic settlement in the city. The ward of Moss Side, which had been a gateway for Caribbean and African immigrants, experienced repeated slum clearances in which whole communities were relocated and large tracts of housing stock were demolished and redesigned. The relationship between these physical and demographic changes has been overshadowed by the persisting stigmatization of Moss Side as a racialized "ghetto," which has meant that outsiders have constructed the area as possessing a fixed and homogenous identity. This article uses geographic information systems in conjunction with local surveys and archival records to explore how the dynamics of immigrant mobility within Moss Side were shaped by housing stock, external racism, family strategies, and urban policy. Whereas scholarship on ethnic segregation in Britain has focused on the internal migration of ethnic groups between administrative areas, using areal interpolation to connect demographic data and the built environment reveals the intense range of movements that developed within the variegated urban landscape of Moss Side.

T1  - The praxis of ethnic studies: transforming second sight into critical consciousness
AN  - 1784151073
AB  - This article focuses on a youth participatory action research (YPAR) program called the Social Justice Education Project (SJEP) that fostered young people of color's critical consciousness. Their critical consciousness emerged through praxis (reflection/action) while focusing on preserving ethnic studies in Tucson, Arizona. Because the SJEP home was in ethnic studies, the youth also struggled to keep their program alive. The Arizona Department of Education claimed the program bred 'radicals' who wanted to overthrow the government and therefore lobbied the state legislature to ban K-12 ethnic studies in public schools. In January 2012, the ban went into effect, shutting down ethnic studies classes as well as the SJEP. Young people's qualitative research on their struggle led to action to save the education that gave them hope for a more equitable and just world. The article addresses the praxis of YPAR, which sparks a thought process leading to the drive to take action. Observing and documenting educational injustices inspire the need to seek radical change of Self and schools. Through the reflection and action facilitated by YPAR, young people of color construct a message about the importance of ethnic studies for individual as well as social transformation.

T1  - Zones of Difference, Boundaries of Access: Moral Geography and Community Mapping in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire
AN  - 1768022783
AB  - In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 18% of men who have sex with men (MSM) are HIV-positive. Based on ethnographic research conducted among HIV peer educators and activists in Abidjan, I examine their narratives and hand-drawn maps of city space. I draw on a methodological process of map-making to examine research participants' evaluations of neighborhoods and link these evaluations to debates over national and cultural belonging in Côte d'Ivoire. I suggest a moral geography emerges from the maps and narratives and ask what the bioethical implications of moral geography are in the context of service delivery and activism among sexual minorities.

T1  - Mobilising abroad across ethnic lines: Home-country politics and immigrant political engagement in comparative perspective
AN  - 1790890882
AB  - Scholarship on immigrant political participation has recently examined how immigrants engage in collective action in the receiving society, whereas scholarship focussing on immigrant home-country politics has focused on debating immigrant political engagement vis-à-vis the origin society. What the literature has neglected is how immigrants engage simultaneously in immigrant and home-country politics. This article fills this lacuna through multi-sited fieldwork observations and interviews, showing how the Ecuadorian participants in this study engage in home-country politics in Madrid and New York City through grassroots organisations and why the leaders and members of these organisations reach out to non-ethnically based associations to make demands on the receiving society governments. The engagement of Ecuadorian political parties in the host societies heightens distrust among the participants in this study, inhibiting their organisation at the ethno-national level. As a result, participants find venues for engagement outside of their nationality group.

T1  - Religious minorities and secularism: an alternative view of the impact of religion on the political values of Muslims in Europe
AN  - 1784150903
AB  - This paper proposes an alternative explanation of Muslims' endorsement of secular values based on their belonging to religious minorities. We argue that, contrary to what is often asserted in both the academic literature and the public debate, Muslims' endorsement of secular values is not simply a matter of strong individual religiosity, but may also result from belonging to a religious minority. We suggest that this group-level variable may explain differences in the support for democratic values by Muslims in Europe, in addition to the individual-level variable pertaining to individual religiosity. Our findings show that belonging to a religious minority in the country of origin positively affects the degree of support of secularist values. More generally, they suggest that denominational Muslim identities should be investigated by taking into account the role of belonging to religious minorities. Moreover, the article will show how belonging to a religious minority can moderate the negative effect of religiosity on secular values.

T1  - Predictors of Living in Precarious Housing Among Immigrants Accessing Housing Support Services
AN  - 1760244468
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify factors that explain immigrant housing vulnerability, thereby contributing to the growth of a more substantial knowledge base on the intersection between immigration, housing and homelessness. Administrative data on housing support service recipients (n=4168) in Alberta, Canada, were analysed to determine the varied demographic, socio-economic and health-related factors that contribute to living in a precarious housing situation (such as homelessness, couch surfing, staying with friends or family etc.). Logistic regression analysis shows that being an immigrant is a protective factor from living in a precarious housing situation. For the immigrant subsample (n=525), logistic regression analysis demonstrates that living in a larger city, having a mental illness and being married were protective factors from living in a precarious housing situation. However, having an addiction and being precariously employed (such as only working part-time, having temporary employment or being unemployed) were risk factors for living in a precarious housing situation. Shared and distinctive vulnerabilities among the immigrant subsample and the full study sample are discussed, along with implications for specific policy and programmes that aim to address the housing needs of immigrants.

T1  - Techniques for Protecting Minority Languages under Belgian Federalism
AN  - 1855325765
AB  - As one of the few countries in the Council of Europe, Belgium has, to date, not ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as well as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Nevertheless, minorities are protected in Belgium due to its specific federal structure. Several instruments provide a balance between the two major language groups in the country: the Flemish and the French-speaking language group. This article focuses on these special techniques and situates them in the historical and specific judicial background of Belgium.

T1  - Territoriality and Minority Language Rights
AN  - 1855323436
AB  - Territorial principle emerges not only in domestic legislations on language rights, but also in international documents. The article aims at offering an overview of the interpretations of territoriality in international documents relevant for minority language rights, with a special focus on the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. While states often use territorial requirements as a tool of political control over minority language use, the interpretation of their obligations under the two Council of Europe treaties would require a more practical and technical approach to territorial limitations.

T1  - REFLECTIONS OF MULTICULTURALISM AND PATRIOTISM IN SLOVENE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULA/Odsevi multikulturnosti in patriotizma v slovenskih osnovnosolskih ucnih nacrtih
AN  - 1830662397
AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the inclusion of patriotic elements in the curricula of elementary school subjects which are adapted to a multicultural environment. The legislative framework of the educational system in Slovenia anticipates the modification of curricula when elements of a minority's identity are in question. The results of the analysis can be summarised in two sets of findings: the method of the inclusion of patriotic elements differs firstly according to the subject's curriculum (absence of a strategic approach), and secondly depending on the minority in question. It seems as if the integration of patriotic elements in the curricula of both national minorities is coincidental.

T1  - Self-reference and (dis) equilibrium of psychomental complex: ethnic policies of 'social (dis) harmony' in Northeast China and 'national (dis) unity' in the Russian Far East
AN  - 1784139364
AB  - This work is an attempt to describe the reproduction of ethnic/national boundaries as a closed self-referential cognitive process that reproduces itself from itself. It describes some aspects of how this complex interrelation between cognitive structures and the formation of ethnic/national groups functions on the example of ethnic policies of 'social harmony' on the Northeast China and 'national unity' in the Russian Far East. The article shows how ethnic policies in both countries demonstrate the inability to provide either harmony or unity. However, these disappointed expectations return into national discourse as political ideologies that help preserve the government's legitimacy, legitimacy of the idea of nation/ethnicity and motivate the society to continue the nation-building process.

T1  - Sense of Place and Mental Wellness of Visible Minority Immigrants in Hamilton, Ontario: Revelations from Key Informants
AN  - 1778915998
AB  - This paper explores key informants’ revelations on immigrants’ sense of place and mental wellness in Hamilton, Ontario, directed toward processes and programs that challenge belongingness and integration. Grounded in key informant interviews, our analysis underscores the importance of understanding immigrants’ sense of community, belonging embedded in socioeconomic conditions, and implications on mental wellness. It is proposed that settlement service providers and other stakeholders adopt a broad and multifaceted approach that recognizes the importance of addressing immigrants’ conditions in a holistic manner. This could be achieved by focusing on policies that affect all determinants of health (including mental health) through the integration of public policies into a comprehensive package of health improvement and promotion strategies, and should be incorporated into policies of health and health-related institutions for implementation.

T1  - Do Immigrants' Preferences for Neighbourhood Qualities Contribute to Segregation? The Case of Oslo
AN  - 1784151344
AB  - Ethnic residential segregation is often explained with the claim that 'immigrants don't want to integrate-they prefer to stick together with co-ethnics'. By contrast, mixed neighbourhoods are seen as crucial for achieving social cohesion. In line with spatial assimilation theory there is a normative assumption that people interact with those living nearby. From interviews on neighbourhood qualities and locations valued by Oslo residents of Turkish, Somali and Polish backgrounds, we raise questions about the validity of two assumptions: that most immigrants want to live in the same neighbourhoods as co-ethnics; and that they want to live close to co-ethnics because they do not want to integrate. For reasons of socialisation, main preferences were for mixed neighbourhoods that included ethnic Norwegians. Whereas the preference for people of other immigrant backgrounds was linked to possibilities for socialisation, the preference for ethnic Norwegians in the neighbourhood was linked to possibilities for social integration. Co-ethnic networks could be maintained on the city level. Importantly, housing moves tended to be guided by other factors than population composition in the area.

T1  - Ukrainian Canadians, Canada, Ukraine, and the Popular Imagination
AN  - 1749279512
AB  - This special issue of Canadian Ethnic Studies is being published at the intersection of two momentous events. In Canada the 125th anniversary of Ukrainian settlement will be celebrated in 2016. Although it is highly likely that individual Ukrainians came to Canada much earlier, 1891 is generally accepted as the beginning of the first wave of mass migration from Ukraine. Canada is now home to the third largest population of Ukrainians in the world (after Ukraine and Russia), numbering over 1.2 million or approximately 4% of the population in 2011. In Ukraine, contemporaneously, a battle is being waged to preserve an independent, integral Ukraine. As recently as a quarter-century ago and for centuries before, the preceding reference would have been to “establishing,” not “preserving,” an independent Ukraine. In the century preceding 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, Ukraine’s cultural heritage was under threat—as it had been for centuries before—but a variant of it was preserved and developed in Canada. This fact was noted with some surprise by Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine’s second president, when he was serenaded in Ukrainian by school children enrolled in the English-Ukrainian Bilingual program in Edmonton on October 25, 1994. With Ukraine’s declaration of independence, Ukrainian Canadians at last had an independent homeland with which they could identify. Older generations—especially the so-called “DPs” (Displaced Persons) who had been forced to leave Ukraine during and after World War II—returned to visit the country that had been preserved only in their memories. They came back to Canada having realized that their true homeland was Canada and were grateful for it. This realization was no doubt helped along when their naively offered, unsolicited advice on various matters was rebuffed by Ukraine’s first president, Leonid Krawchuk, who told them in no uncertain terms not to meddle in Ukraine’s affairs. Now, finally, we all seem to be on the same page. A younger, more sophisticated, worldly, and English-speaking leadership has emerged in Ukraine—a leadership that has recognized the importance of gaining the support of the Western world of which it wants to be a part. This change in attitude and outlook is exemplified by Ukraine’s national anthem: the first stanza was slightly modified in early 2013 and the result was the transformation of a dirge sung in a minor key in Canada to a triumphal hymn. Canada has responded positively and supportively to the most recent events in Ukraine, thereby eliciting President Putin’s dismissive and ill-informed comment. Canada had done the same in 1991 when Canada was the first country to recognize the newly-independent Ukraine. Of course, one does have to admit that the Canadian government’s response in both instances may not have been wholly altruistic since Ukrainians constitute the ninth largest ethnic group in the country and arguably exert more influence than their numbers might suggest because they are well organized and because of the younger, more activist leadership of their umbrella organization, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress.

T1  - Gypsies and Travellers: a big or divided society?
AN  - 1728661985; 201534223
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore the impact of localism on vulnerable minorities like Gypsies and Travellers. This paper draws on the literature on social contract, with particular reference to Hobbes, Rawls and Habermas. The key findings of this paper indicate that localism can impede equality but also that statist forms of centralism can be counterproductive to the achievement of equality. The insights in this paper contribute to the literature on equality by proposing a policy framework which fuses the participatory and deliberative practices associated with forms of localism with the safeguards and protection of centralism.

T1  - Unpacking the Roma Participation Puzzle: Presence, Voice and Influence
AN  - 1667946796; 201509574
AB  - The idea that Roma communities need to be included in public life is rather uncontroversial, widely accepted by Roma activists, academics and policy-makers in national and transnational political contexts. But, what do we mean by participation? Are we talking about formal political structures or do we refer to the capacity of ordinary Roma to have a presence in public life? The right to participation for minorities is specified by international norms but is interpreted differently in national contexts. Nevertheless, participation alone is not enough, thus minorities require 'effective' participation given that the utilitarian principles of liberal democracy means that groups such as Roma will always be outvoted. This article is based on the conviction that addressing the multiple and inter-connected issues facing Roma communities across Europe requires the participation of Roma in social, economic and political life. Whilst the article acknowledges the structural barriers which inhibit attempts to foster the integration of Roma communities, it does consider different conceptions of political participation including presence, voice and influence and how these are understood by the European Union and its member states with regards to Roma.

AN  - 1708525116; 201528885
AB  - Using three national surveys from the Great Recession period in America, I demonstrate two aspects of group-based political attitudes beyond citizens' partisanship preferences: (1) the economic scapegoating of African Americans by whites during the recession and (2) Latinos' and African Americans' use of their marginalized economic status as a lens for understanding how mortgage companies and bankers treated their communities during the downturn. I also discuss the broad impact of disparate economic opinions on citizens' political outlook for the future. The key patterns of political attitudes are shown to be remarkably consistent from 2009 to 2012. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Black, Queer, and Looking for a Job: An Exploratory Study of Career Decision Making Among Self-Identified Sexual Minorities at an Urban Historically Black College/University
AN  - 1660024556; 201505648
AB  - This thematically analyzed study seeks to explore the career decision perceptions of sexual minority college students at an urban historically black college/university (HBCU). This qualitative focus group study delved into how sexual minorities feel their visible variables of race, gender expression, and degree of disclosure influence their career thought process. Theories relative to the study included Krumboltz's social learning theory of career decision-making, gender role theory, racial socialization, Cass's homosexual identity model, and impression management. Though participants initially proclaimed they did not allow their sexual minority identity to affect their career decisions, their overall responses indicated otherwise.

T1  - A Preliminary Examination of African American and Caucasian Hospitality Management Student Perceptions and Attitudes Toward Diversity Issues
AN  - 1700676663; 201525293
AB  - Diversity or multiculturalism is a concept that includes words such as acceptance and respect. A movement toward diversity should include the examination of differences in a safe, cultivating, and constructive environment. One such environment is classrooms located on college and university campuses across the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine a cross-section of hospitality management students based on their ethnicity. A self-selected convenience sample of students were used with data being collected using a paper-and-pencil survey measuring attitudes and perceptions toward various diversity concepts. It was found that differences existed between the two ethnic groups around specific concepts of workplace equity. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The dialogicality of cleanliness 'thematizing' the clean/dirty antinomy in the background of the theory of social representations
AN  - 1728663366; 201533980
AB  - Speltini and Passini manuscript points to a theoretical framework for exploring the psychosocial dimensions of the issue of cleanliness addressing the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies. In particular, the authors discuss the symbolic and normative valence of the issue of cleanliness and demonstrate its social and cultural rootedness feeding negative attitudes and adverse emotions towards persons and groups. Elaborating on the arguments of Speltini and Passini, I endorse the conceptual overlapping between the issue of cleanliness and the dialogical notion of basic themata. In the background of social representation theory, the process of anchoring serves as context for addressing this conceptual overlapping and for challenging the profound interrelationship between the issue of cleanliness and the theme of intergroup dynamics and inter-ethnic encounters.

T1  - The theme of indivisibility in the post-war struggle against prejudice in the United States
AN  - 1660024003; 201505829
AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transgressing community: the case of Muslims in a twenty-first-century British city
AN  - 1551000471; 201428992
AB  - This paper draws on ethnographic research carried out in Birmingham, UK -- a city significant for its sizeable Muslim population and its iconic role in the history of minority ethnic settlement in Britain -- to consider how associations of place and ethnicity work in different ways to inform ideas about 'Muslim community' in twenty-first-century Britain. The paper charts happenings around a local event in an area of majority Asian settlement and how representations of the area as a place of Muslim community were used to implicate it in the 'war on terror'. The paper goes on to show how this sensibility is disrupted by Muslims themselves through alternative engagements with space and ethnicity. The paper argues that these offer a ground for making Muslim community in ways that actively engage with histories and patterns of ethnic settlement in the city rather than being determined by them.

T1  - The Great Recession and the Allure of New Immigrant Destinations in the United States
AN  - 1531933753; 201423268
AB  - In the 1990s, the immigrant population in the United States dispersed to non-traditional settlement locations (what have become known as 'new immigrant destinations'). This paper examines whether the allure of new destinations persisted in the 2000s with a particular focus on the internal migration of the foreign-born during the recent deep recessionary period and its aftermath. Three specific questions motivate the analysis. First, are immigrants, much like the U.S.-born population, becoming less migratory within the country over time? Second, is immigrant dispersal from traditional gateways via internal migration continuing despite considerable economic contraction in many new destination metropolitan areas? Third, is immigration from aboard a substitute for what appears to be declining immigrant internal migration to new destinations? The findings reveal a close correlation between the declining internal migration propensity of the U.S.-born and immigrants in the last two decades. We also observe parallels between the geographies of migration of native- and foreign-born populations with both groups moving to similar metropolitan areas in the 1990s. This redistributive association, however, weakened in the subsequent decade as new destination metropolitan areas lost their appeal for both groups, especially immigrants. There is no evidence to suggest that immigration from abroad is substituting for the decline in immigrant redistribution through internal migration to new destinations. Across destination types, the relationship between immigration from abroad and the internal migration of the foreign-born remained the same during and after the Great Recession as in the period immediately before it.

T1  - Beyond Treatment and Impact: A Context-Oriented Approach to Employment Discrimination
AN  - 1512220941; 201408813
AB  - Discrimination remains integral to understanding both how inequality is produced and how it can be remedied in employment settings. Yet like many sociological concepts, the notion of discrimination involves an uneasy mapping of theory to practice. Traditional conceptualizations of discrimination as differential treatment are ill-fitted to the structural and relational nature of much discrimination in the contemporary era. The disparate impact doctrine, which recognizes policies or practices that systematically disadvantage protected groups, picks up some of the theoretical slack, but offers little in the way of conceptualizing individuals' complex and entangled experiences with inequality at work. In this article, I provide a conceptual reorganization of theories of discrimination, underscoring recent calls to move beyond the confines of the current disparate treatment and disparate impact binary by recognizing the structurally and culturally embedded nature of bias and discrimination. Drawing on recent sociological research as well as my own analysis of legal records and interviews with plaintiffs involved in high-profile sex and race lawsuits settled in the past decade, I illustrate how differential treatment emerges in the context of and enabled by systems of vulnerability and privilege, workplace culture, and compositional asymmetries. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of this framework for antidiscrimination enforcement efforts. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND ETHNIC MOBILIZATION: U.S. MILITARY DEATHS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
AN  - 1767329101; 201606180
AB  - This study explores the question of proportionality of American military deaths during the Vietnam War in terms of patterns of social stratification and ethnic mobilization. In particular, this study divides the war into two phases according to military goal: a victory phase and a withdrawal phase. Several hypotheses are tested by phase of war and indicate several important findings. First, deaths among draftees increase as the phase of war shifts from an emphasis on victory to an emphasis on withdrawal. Second, death rates among Hispanic draftees are significantly higher than death rates among other ethnic group draftees throughout the course of the whole war. Third, black servicemen die disproportionately to their to their overall death rate for the whole war in the victory phase of the war and Hispanic servicemen die disproportionately to their overall death rate for the whole war in the withdrawal phase of the war. Fourth, black and Hispanic servicemen come from less affluent communities than do white servicemen. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Seeking Equality in Broadcasting: The Case for Third Sector Broadcasting
AN  - 1684424337; 201518528
AB  - Members of groups which are traditionally economically or socially disadvantaged tend to also suffer from additional barriers in relation to their ability to establish and control mass media outlets and from insufficiency of media output which represents them and addresses their specific needs. These inequalities in the field of mass media can help perpetuate and aggravate a situation of marginalization and are especially notable in relation to broadcasting due to the higher barriers of entry associated with the medium. The present article makes a case for the state promotion and support of third sector broadcasting as an affirmative measure which can be used to combat inequalities in broadcasting while discussing its advantages and disadvantages in comparison to alternative measures. The aim is not to negate the need for other ty pes of measures but to ex plain why aiding the development of third sector broadcasting outlets is an option which warrants serious consideration by every state seeking to address situations in which specific groups have been disadvantaged in the field of mass media and broadcasting in specific.

T1  - Does Climate Change Worsen Resource Scarcity and Cause Violent Ethnic Conflict?
AN  - 1622297003; 201438437
AB  - Does climate change create conditions in which ethnic groups, particularly in developing countries, become more likely to struggle for scarce resources which can then spur ethnically motivated violence and serious atrocities? Or is the relation between climate change and atrocities, if there is one, far more complex and perhaps indirect? How should climate change be viewed as a risk factor for the onset of violent ethnic conflict? What practical relevance could climate change effects have on early warning and prevention of serious human rights violations including crimes against humanity and genocide? The author first considers whether climate change science warnings deserve to be taken seriously before reviewing empirical studies focussing on the supposed link between climate change and ethnic conflict. Second, he argues that it is valuable to treat climate change as a possible risk factor for ethnic conflict situations in which crimes against humanity or genocide might be perpetrated, and to reflect upon early warning and prevention in this connection. The author then sets out five considerations mat research on the question of a causal link between climate change and ethnic conflict should take into account. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Latino and Latina Educational Attainment: An Investigation of Bi-Lingual Language Abilities and the Familial Context
AN  - 1567049314; 201435088
AB  - Compared to other ethnic groups in the United States, Latinos have been shown to have lower levels of school performance. Researchers have often pointed to characteristics such as lower family incomes and greater numbers of children as reasons for their lower levels of academic success. Previous studies also suggest that language abilities, particularly English skills, may present barriers for Latino children to perform well in school. Using data from the 2004 Immigration and Intergenerational Mobility in Metropolitan Los Angeles survey, this study directly examines the relative impact of family and language characteristics on the school performance and educational attainment of young adult Latinas and Latinos. Overall, females are shown to have higher academic performance and attainment. Family characteristics appear to have a greater impact on females' educational success, whereas males' educational success appears to be more susceptible to the influence of language characteristics, particularly with regard to Spanish language skills.

T1  - Calibrated Ambitions: Low Educational Ambition as a Form of Strategic Adaptation Among Chinese Youth in Spain
AN  - 1494750919; 201402181
AB  - Deemed 'model minorities,' second-generation Chinese-Americans have, on average, high levels of educational attainment and, as a result, they have experienced more upward mobility than other groups. Yet, on the other side of the Atlantic, a strikingly different story about Chinese immigrants and their offspring emerges. Based on analysis of the Longitudinal Study of the Second Generation in Spain, findings from this study show that Chinese youths in Spain have substantially lower educational ambitions and attainment than youths from every other nationality. Met with discrimination at school and in the labor market, yet finding financial success in niche markets as small business owners, I argue that the Chinese in Spain have, at least temporarily, forged an alternative pathway of mobility based on entrepreneurial endeavors rather than educational accomplishments -- a formula passed on from immigrant parents to their offspring. The way Chinese youths in Spain have calibrated their ambition represents a form of strategic adaptation to the barriers put up against immigrant minorities in Spanish society.

T1  - The Relation Between Parental Racial Socialization and African Americans' Racial Ideologies
AN  - 1438564599; 201340215
AB  - Racial ideology shapes how African Americans interpret the world and cope with race-related issues and events. A complex interaction of individual, family, and group experiences in one's sociocultural and historical context is critical to the development of racial ideology. While parental racial socialization has been associated with racial identity, the more specific relationship between parental racial socialization and racial ideology is less understood. The present study examined the association of four dimensions of racial socialization messages reported by participants (cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarian socialization) with four dimensions of racial ideology (assimilationist, humanist, oppressed minority, and nationalist) using hierarchical linear regression (n = 89 African American college students). Participants' endorsement of assimilationist and oppressed minority ideologies was not predicted by racial socialization messages. However, endorsement of humanist and nationalist ideologies was predicted by cultural and egalitarian socialization messages in opposing directions. Cultural socialization was associated with endorsement of higher nationalist and lower humanist ideology, whereas egalitarian socialization was associated with the endorsement of lower nationalist and higher humanist ideology.

T1  - The Relationship Between Multiple Roles and Well-Being among Gay, Lesbian, and Heterosexual Adults
AN  - 1463013116; 201345894
AB  - Previous studies have shown that occupying multiple roles, as a worker, a partner, and a parent, is associated with higher levels of well-being. Yet, because these studies have been based on predominantly heterosexual samples, it is unclear whether this pattern extends to gay men and lesbians or varies by sexual orientation. This study, which uses pooled data from a probability sample of U.S. adults (N = 18,187), begins to fill the void. Results suggest that for sexual minorities as well as heterosexuals, occupying multiple roles is positively associated with well-being; however, the findings suggest that differences exist across gendered sexual orientation groups in both the extent and strength of the associations. There also are differences across these groups in the importance of different role combinations in relation to well-being. Results are discussed in light of traditional role theory and in terms of contextual factors related to sexual orientation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding Latin American Beliefs about Racial Inequality
AN  - 1520336642; 201413522
AB  - Scholars argue that Latin American ideologies of mestizaje, or racial mixing, mask ethnoracial discrimination. We examine popular explanations for indigenous or Afrodescendant disadvantage in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru using the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey. Findings show that numerical majorities across all countries endorse structural-disadvantage explanations and reject victim-blaming stances; in seven of eight countries, they specifically recognize discrimination against ethnoracial minorities. Brazilians most point to structural causes, while Bolivians are least likely to recognize discrimination. While educational status differences tend to be sizable, dominant and minority explanations are similar. Both are comparable to African-American views and contrast with those of U.S. whites.

T1  - The Empire Prays Back: Religion, Secularity, and Queer Critique
AN  - 1429625457; 201335708
AB  - The past decades have been ones of unprecedented sociocultural and legal gains for queer politics. But these achievements have been accompanied by a severe critique of queer racism and of the imperialist agenda of global gay politics. The employment of gender and sexuality as alibis for legitimizing violence against religious groups, especially Muslims, has opened up fundamental questions regarding the future of queer emancipatory politics. While supportive of the urgency of critiquing the complicities of Western queer politics in neoliberal, imperial discourses, I am troubled by the silences on and the lack of critique of homophobia and heterosexism in diasporic and postcolonial contexts. The unwillingness to address the violent experiences of those subjects who are vulnerable to both queer racism as well as postcolonial heteronormativity has become the Achilles' heel of the recent postsecular turn in queer postcolonial scholarship and activism. Religious violence against sexual minorities is ignored by prioritizing violence against religious minorities. The sole focus on queer racism and homonationalism in the global North neglects how supposedly conflicting ideologies of heteronormative nationalisms on both sides of the postcolonial divide in fact collaborate with each other. There is an urgent need to explore nonimperialist strategies of contesting heterosexism and homophobia in diasporic and postcolonial contexts and pursue a more complex, multidirectional politics of critique that is directed at coercive practices across the secularism-religion divide. Critique, when engaging with solely one dimension of domination, risks reproducing violence. Thus, anti-imperialist and antiracist critique of queer politics must be accompanied by a critique of "reproductive heteronormativity" within postcolonial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Arranged Marriages as Support for Intra-ethnic Matchmaking? A Case Study on Muslim Migrants in Germany
AN  - 1364702404; 201323432
AB  - This article discusses the behavioural and institutional mechanisms that guide the matchmaking process of arranged marriages amongst Muslim migrants in Germany and clarifies how this practice may influence ethnic homogamy. The focus is on general characteristics of arranged marriages rather than differences between diverse ethnic groups. The methodology is qualitative due to the sensitive and complex topic and the current state of research. Typically, the whole family is deeply involved in the process of arrangement, which consists of three stages (pre-engagement, engagement, marriage). Thereby, the extension of parental scope of action by means of institutionalized admission procedures turns out to be vitally important. In consideration of the fact that mate selection takes place at the pre-engagement stage, it is the most crucial. Furthermore, differences to other partner-choosing processes are at their most distinct at this point, being responsible for the identification and labelling of this model as an arranged marriage. Selection criteria are mainly determined by the reputation of the marriage candidate and her/his family along with cultural features (such as belonging to a particular religious group, ethnicity or nationality). In our study, preferences for a cultural homogenous match were the most dominant ones. This inclination may cause the tendency towards transnational marriages when there are no suitable marriage candidates to be found in Germany. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Capital and Ethno-racial Diversity: Learning to Trust in an Immigrant Society
AN  - 1322716453; 201310846
AB  - This article builds on the insights of the contact hypothesis and political socialization literatures to go beyond recent findings that racial and ethnic diversity have overwhelmingly negative effects on social capital, particularly generalized trust. Using the Canadian General Social Survey (2003), our results show that despite a negative relationship among adults, younger Canadians with racial and ethnic diversity in their social networks show higher levels of generalized trust. The results seem to confirm that youth socialization experiences with rising diversity and the normalization of diversity in a multicultural environment contribute to beneficial (instead of detrimental) effects of diverse social networks.

T1  - Homonegative Microaggressions and Identity in Bisexual Men and Women
AN  - 1322724040; 201310836
AB  - Homonegative microaggressions are small verbal, behavioral, or environmental slights, intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile or derogatory messages toward sexual minorities. This is an exploratory attempt to investigate how bisexual men and women experience these microaggressions, compared to gay men and lesbians. Bisexual men and women were found to experience the microaggression Alien in Own Land and report more identity confusion than gay men or lesbians. Using a hierarchy of four linear regression models, experience of the microaggression Alien in Own Land was found to mediate the relationship between a bisexual orientation and feelings of identity confusion. These results have implications for future research and for clinicians with bisexual clients. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Capital Formation and Diversity: Impacts of Individual and Place-Related Characteristics
AN  - 1551001454; 201429076
AB  - Using structural equation modelling, we assess the degree to which the characteristics of both individuals and the cities in which they live may affect scores on three domains underlying social capital-trust, interaction and membership. We find that diversity, as it relates to both the individual and the city of residence, affects social capital formation. However, the impact of diversity is not necessarily negative. As the proportion of visible minorities in a city increases, the average level of trust decreases, suggesting that, on this dimension at least, increased diversity can have a negative impact on this aspect of social capital formation. However, as contextual or city-level diversity increases, the level of participation in organisations and trust in others increases. This suggests that bridging social capital can increase as diversity increases. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond prejudice to prejudices
AN  - 1417526347; 201332052
AB  - Different groups, because they are perceived to pose different threats, elicit different prejudices. Collective action by disadvantaged groups can amplify the perception of specific threats, with predictable and potentially counterproductive consequences. It is important to carefully consider the threat-based psychology of prejudice(s) before implementing any strategy intended to promote positive social change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Deconstructing Good Times and The Cosby Show: In Search of My "Authentic" Black Experience
AN  - 1373427882; 201328616
AB  - As countless critics of The Cosby Show (1984-1992) would have us believe, the Huxtable family, as portrayed and envisioned by educator and comedian Bill Cosby, is not the traditional representation of Black family life. For many critics, as well as some Cosby show defenders, the experience depicted by the fictional Huxtable family was the unique experience of too few African Americans at the time; the suggestion is that the family is very wealthy. Contrary to the moral majority, its critics and defenders, I am not from the upper or middle classes like the Huxtable family; however, I identified with The Cosby Show more than with its predecessors, like Good Times (1974-1979). African Americans are no different than any other American group, and therefore, as writer and novelist Wendy Alexia Rountree suggests in her article " 'Faking the Funk': A Journey Towards Authentic Blackness," we "should be allowed to develop individual identities that are not considered in conflict with our ethnic group identity but as a legitimate part of it." Consequently, as someone who identifies with The Cosby Show; who is an autistic, working-class Black female from the projects of East Harlem with two Ivy League degrees; and for whom cowboy boots are her footwear of choice, I say, take Good Times and The Cosby Show if you must, but leave me my Black experience.

T1  - Acculturation and Self-Rated Health among Latino and Asian Immigrants to the United States
AN  - 1266149436; 201300399
AB  - The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-horn Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican). Using comprehensive measures of acculturation, we demonstrate that across ethnic groups, and despite the widely varying contexts of the sending countries and receiving communities, native-language dominance is associated with worse self-rated health relative to bilingualism, and measures of lower acculturation -- coethnic ties and remittances -- are associated with better self-rated health; and moreover, these associations are only partially mediated by socioeconomic status, and not mediated by acculturative stress, discrimination, social support, or health behaviors. We speculate that immigrants who maintain a native language while also acquiring English, as has been shown for other immigrant outcomes, attain a bicultural fluency, which also enables good health. Surprisingly, we do not find strong associations between duration of time in the United States or age at migration -- measures frequently used to proxy acculturation -- with self-rated health. Our findings illustrate the complexity of measuring acculturation and its influence on health for immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Disability Status Differentials Among Asian Immigrants in the United States: The Added Dimensions of Duration and Age
AN  - 1494750506; 201402132
AB  - The healthy immigrant and erosion effects are widely cited observations for immigrants' health patterns in the United States. Yet, these effects are not always found in empirical studies. We examined both effects among Asians using the 2000 Census Public Microdata Sample. We examined six disability outcomes: sensory, physical, mental, mobility, work and self-care. We also investigated the moderating effect of age on years in the United States. We found substantial variation in disability status across our 13 Asian ethnic groups. Support for the healthy immigrant and erosion effects differed across the disability outcomes. For physical, sensory and mental disabilities, the healthy immigrant and erosion effects were displayed at younger ages. For work and mobility disabilities, younger immigrants displayed a higher prevalence for these outcomes than their US-born counterparts, but this pattern reversed at older ages. Self-care disability did not show any duration differences. Age also appears to be an important moderator of the healthy immigrant and erosion effects. Cohorts and question wording may also be important alternative explanations to immigrant health patterns. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do Survey Data Estimate Earnings Inequality Correctly?: Measurement Errors Among Black and White Male Workers
AN  - 1315600374; 201307602
AB  - Few studies have considered how earnings inequality estimates may be affected by measurement error in self-reported earnings in surveys. Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income and Program Participation with their W-2 earnings records, we examine the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on economic inequality estimates. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Disparities and Implicit Bias: A Commentary
AN  - 1125223749; 201240401
AB  - Despite changing societal norms that are less tolerant of overt discrimination, demonstrable disparities between racial and gender groups remain. The contributors to this impressive special issue document and offer explanations for these disparities in employment and professional contexts, and with regard to disparate outcomes associated with the legal system, and in medical and health care contexts. In our commentary, we examine these aggregate-level disparities and the individual-level explanatory accounts proposed for their existence. The evidence that these papers present is often enough to rule out alternative explanatory accounts, and implicit bias remains a viable account for disparities that, to varying degrees, fit with the available data and the claim that implicit biases are contributing to an understanding of ongoing real-world disparities. As such, we believe that implicit bias research will continue to play a crucial role in understanding and hopefully reducing these aggregate-level disparities in employment, legal, and health care domains.

T1  - WHAT WE FACE
AN  - 1531930673; 201423292
AB  - While many sociological studies analyze the causes, conditions, and mechanisms perpetuating American racial inequality, the literature on how African Americans understand and explain these inequalities is less developed. Drawing on 150 interviews with middle-class and working-class African American men and women, this paper analyzes inductively how respondents define and conceptualize the most pressing obstacles facing their group when probed on this question. We find that middle- and working-class respondents alike identify the problem of racism as the most salient obstacle facing African Americans. Class differences appear with respect to what other obstacles are singled out as salient: while middle-class respondents focus on lack of racial solidarity among Blacks and economic problems (in this order), working-class respondents are more concerned with the fragility of the Black family followed by the lack of racial solidarity. This analysis discusses the relevance of considering how groups make sense of obstacles, and of racism and discrimination in particular, for the study of destigmatization and antiracist strategies of stigmatized minorities.

T1  - Ethnogenesis, Ethnicity, And "Cultural Refusal": The Case of the Salasacas in Highland Ecuador
AN  - 1438549202; 201340197
AB  - The Salasacas are one of several indigenous peoples in highland Ecuador who consider themselves, and are considered by others, to be a distinct, homogeneous blood group. Throughout the Incaic, Spanish, and national periods, we trace their ethnogenesis from diverse origins to a single, highly unified ethnic community, Using an interdisciplinary methodology that combines historical and ethnographic data and follows the movement of current Salasaca anthroponyms, we identify three seventeenth-century migrations of different groups to Salasaca. These groups were still separate in the eighteenth century, and we follow their fusion into a single, exclusive, and vocal ethnic group in the post-independence period. We focus careful attention on their often novel responses to multiple historical contingencies over the course of five hundred years. Departing from writers who emphasize the political nature of ethnicity, we argue that Salasaca became a zone of cultural refusal as indigenous actors made a conscious decision to maintain a specific indigenous cultural identity.

T1  - Symbolic Equality: Law and National Symbols in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1283642635; 201303452
AB  - The way in which the law regulates the display of national symbols has important consequences for minority national groups. If the majority is allowed to monopolise the official display of national symbols, members of the minority may be further alienated and discouraged from participating in public life. In contrast, a more even-handed approach to national symbols has the potential to foster an inclusive and pluri-national public culture. This article evaluates the regulation of national symbols in Northern Ireland. It contrasts the relative success of legislation regulating the display of symbols in the workplace with the latest equality litigation under Northern Ireland's Good Friday Agreement of 1998 ('the Agreement'). With respect to the latter, it is argued that the case-law suffers from a general failure to appreciate the implications of the Agreement for the display of national symbols. The article goes on to explain how equality with respect to the display of national symbols -- or 'symbolic equality' -- should be understood as an extension of the Agreement's commitment to the more general principle of 'parity of esteem'.

T1  - Identity Satisfaction Over the Life Course in Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266144742; 201300382
AB  - A variety of models have been proposed to understand the process of coming to terms with a sexual minority identity. What has not been so clearly explored is how an individual's satisfaction with his or her sexual identity develops over the life course. This article explores satisfaction with sexual identity in a large cohort (N = 2,269) of self-identified lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, and considers satisfaction not only from a chronos (life span) but also from a chairos (stage of development) framework. Data show a clear relationship between age group and increased satisfaction with a sexual minority identity. Resilience may be an important contributor to increased satisfaction.

T1  - Paradigm Shifts, Geostrategic Considerations and Minority Initiatives
AN  - 1030866915; 201227884
AB  - Much of the analysis of ethnolinguistic minorities is case specific and concerned with the particular state or national context within which such minorities operate. This paper adopts abroad conceptual stance by focussing on how policies aimed at improving the position of ethnolinguistic minorities in Europe have been subject to broad and profound multi-level influences. These range from policies and practices which have their origin within the minority communities themselves, to the state, the European level and beyond. This paper will identify significant paradigm shifts and highlight structural tensions which derive from neo-liberal and social democratic perspectives coming into conflict as a result of closer European integration and globalization. It will conclude by identifying six salient research themes which may inform more robust policy initiatives capable of building on best practice minority policy in several EU contexts.

T1  - Perceived Expectations for Acculturation: The Transitioning of Hispanics into Southern Communities
AN  - 1266144813; 201300329
AB  - Hispanics are a rapidly growing population that has sought resettlement in nontraditional locations across the United States. Movement in and out of cultural homogeneous communities has implications for an individual's perceived expectations for cultural change. Hispanics (N = 10) in two Southern states were asked questions using semi-structured interviews surrounding their acculturation experiences. Using a grounded theory approach, several themes emerged involving the perceived acceptance of their culture, previous and current ethnic composition of their community, cultural values and behaviors underpinning interaction, and perceived pressures to maintain and change their culture. The comfort and discomfort in interacting with other cultural groups often elicited pressure to change, suppress, or maintain one's culture. Targeted intervention efforts addressing community-level acculturative expectations and individual acculturative difficulties with intercultural interaction may assist Hispanics entering nontraditional areas of resettlement. Social services and policy that recognizes the importance of multicultural growth in their communities, and seeks to identify the current state of social and relational inclusiveness of traditionally marginal groups, may improve racial and ethnic relationships and community health.

T1  - Excuse me, which radical organization are you a member of? Reflections on methods to study highly religious but non-organized Muslims
AN  - 907927976; 201124708
AB  - Research on Muslim minorities in Europe has focused on Muslim organizations. This is understandable as most organizations are uncomplicated objects of study: they provide members for interviews and locations for participant observation. But many Muslims are not engaged in Muslim organizations. How do we research them? Drawing on the experiences from a study on highly practising, but non-organized Muslims in Aarhus, Denmark, this paper will discuss the usefulness of focus group interviews in studying the world views of non-organized Muslims.

T1  - Lived Islam: religious identity with 'non-organized' Muslim minorities
AN  - 907927959; 201124692
AB  - The purpose of this article is to show how a focus on 'non-organized' Muslims in Europe can contribute with insights on the everyday lives and practices of Muslim minorities. The empirical foundation is interviews conducted in Germany and Denmark. I argue that by focusing on institutionalized forms of Islam we run the risk of reifying Muslims as being 'all about Islam'. The article reflects and discusses the benefits of adapting the framework of lived religion methodologically to investigate how Muslim makes sense of Islam on a micro-level. I show how the interviewees in this study have reconfigured religious practices, or no practice at all, which is connected to attitudes of privatization, individualization and pragmatism. The everyday practices and identities can be seen as expressions of minority identities, and as a type of individualized religiosity, and I discuss how these identities are different from the identities of activist and vocal Muslims.

T1  - Exploring citizenship spheres of inclusion/exclusion: rights as 'potential for power'
AN  - 907925917; 201124621
AB  - Ariely examines the logic of inclusion/exclusion involved in the allocation of social, political and cultural rights to minorities. He argues that the unequal allocation of rights is determined by the degree of potential power inherent in the various types of rights, and that rights with more potential power, such as political and cultural representation rights, challenge the dominant group's position more strongly than rights to social welfare and cultural autonomy. Minorities are included at a higher level in spheres of rights with low potential power, and at a lower level in spheres of rights with higher potential power. He uses the case of the Arab citizens of Israel to illustrate the thesis, reviewing institutional practices of inclusion/exclusion as well as the attitudes of Israeli Jews towards the allocation of different rights as reflected in three attitudinal surveys.

AN  - 902079241; 201122209
AB  - Spain is undergoing a process of intense demographic change towards a more diverse society brought about by massive immigration over the last decade that includes a high proportion of Latin Americans. Pejoratively dubbed 'sudacas', they are moving in the opposite direction to the Spanish who went to Latin America 100 years ago. Multicultural Spain has two main facets: the historical regional minorities in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, elements of which have waged struggles for national autonomy; and the recent immigrant minorities, notably the Latin Americans, North Africans and Romanians.

T1  - 'It's a Long Way To the Bottom': The Insignificance of 'the Scots' in Australia
AN  - 1531931234; 201423351
AB  - Australian historians have been reluctant to recognize the significance of Scottish immigration and immigrants. And, until relatively recently, Scottish historians were also indifferent, possibly because Canada and New Zealand seemed more Scottish. It is thus worthwhile to ponder the ways in which Australian (and Scottish) historians have approached Scottish migration to and settlement in Australia. Neglected aspects of the Scottish experience in Australia are exposed and overexposed aspects questioned. Some of the former include the twentieth century, radical politics, sport and popular music; the latter include the nineteenth century, God and Mammon. Despite the alleged invisibility of 'the Scots' in Australia as a group, Scots have consistently been very visible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Bringing together acculturation theory and intergroup contact theory: Predictors of Flemings' expectations of Turks' acculturation behavior
AN  - 1417523620; 201332249
AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moiese, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

T1  - Cosmetic Surgery, Racial Identity, and Aesthetics
AN  - 1417526921; 201332009
AB  - Human motives are varied, often hidden, and sometimes highly complicated, and this point applies with special force to persons' motives to modify their bodies. The motives to undergo cosmetic surgery in order to change one's appearance have, or at least seem to have, racial dimensions that are both particularly complicated and peculiarly obscure. In the case of cosmetic Asian eyelid surgery, at least six theories shed light on the explanation, analysis, and appraisal of this class of body modifications. The theories are here called benign explanation, performance theory, aesthetic oppression, internalized racism, Foucauldian care of the self, and complicity with a racist society. These theories, as articulated here, illuminate bodily alterations that relate to racial identity, especially in regard to minority races. Several of these theories make room for the exercise of freedom in the face of pressures to succumb to a seeming aesthetic ineluctability created by a dominant race. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transforming Livelihoods and Assets through Participatory Approaches: The Kudumbashree in Kerala, India
AN  - 907926840; 201124622
AB  - This article explores to what extent decentralized structures can contribute to asset accumulation among disadvantaged groups, and improving livelihood choices. The process of asset accumulation is tied to the wider context of participatory institutions and opportunities within which social actors can transform assets into meaningful livelihood outcomes. Given its level of social development and civil society in the Indian state of Kerala, the Kudumbashree Initiative, an innovative community-based, decentralized participatory structure aims to build meaningful forms of assets at grassroots levels. Such participatory public action, based on social relationships as well as the combined efforts of the state and grassroots community organizations may provide valuable lessons for developing asset accumulation strategies.

T1  - Estranged Natives and Indigenized Immigrants: A Relational Anthropology of Ethnically Mixed Towns in Israel
AN  - 856403341; 201106915
AB  - Ethnic relations between the Palestinian and Jewish communities in ethnically mixed towns in Israel are marked by class divides, political fragmentation, and perception of alienation vis-a-vis place and other. Analyzing patterns of communal identity politics, this article revisits the spatial history of Jaffa since 1948. Against theories of urban ethnocracy predicated on the convergence of state policies and capitalist accumulation, which in turn engender longstanding spatial segregation between Jews and Arabs and between new and old residents, I argue that it is precisely the indeterminate 'contact zones' between communities and spaces that constitute the political and cultural realities in these cities. Proposing a relational reading of these spatial dynamics, this article shows that in contradistinction to the basic premise of the nation-state, in Jaffa as well as other mixed towns, the coupling between space and identity collapses. The concepts of 'spatial heteronomy' and 'stranger relations' are proposed to characterize the challenge raised by ethnically mixed towns to the Jewish state and to the ethnonational logic that guides it.

T1  - Predicting Earnings Among Immigrants To Canada: The Role Of Source Country
AN  - 964189979; 201207483
AB  - The current study examines the importance of country of origin in predicting the labour market earnings among recent immigrants to Canada. The authors argue that, in addition to individual-level characteristics associated with immigrant capital, macro-level features associated with immigrant origins must be taken into account when considering the economic performance of immigrants in their host country. Country-level factors are said to accompany immigrants to their destination country, which generate disparities in the "quality" of immigrants' human and social capital across origin groups, as well as differences in how they are received by the resident population. The present study uses random effects multilevel modelling to investigate the extent to which immigrant incomes vary randomly across source country while taking into consideration individual-level characteristics selected on the basis of human capital, social capital, and discrimination theories. Multilevel regression analysis confirms that immigrant incomes indeed vary significantly by country of origin, though the effect is small. Furthermore, it is revealed that the gross domestic product (GDP) of the sending country explains much of the level 2 variability in the labour market earnings of recent immigrants, as well as the relationship between racial minority status and immigrant incomes. The practical significance and policy implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Political Participation Among Latinos in the United States: The Effect of Group Identity and Consciousness
AN  - 902083216; 201122332
AB  - Objective: How do group identity and consciousness affect Latinos' political participation in the United States? Recent studies that examine this relationship generally focus on a single ethnic group, for example, Mexicans, or the panethnic group, Latino/Hispanic, which limits the scope of their results. This study investigates how group identity and consciousness affect the political participation of differently identified Latinos. Methods: Using the unique 2007 Latino National Survey (LNS), a telephone survey of 8,500 Latino respondents, I investigate how group identity and consciousness affect political participation, as measured by electoral and nonelectoral activities. Results: Findings suggest that Latinos who self-identify as American are more likely to engage in political action; however, a sense of group consciousness among ethnic, panethnic, and racial-identified Latinos alters this effect. Conclusion: The type of and extent to which Latinos engage in political action is contingent on primary self-identity and specific aspects of group consciousness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Civil Society Contributions to the Work of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities
AN  - 896165433; 201120098
AB  - As a conflict prevention institution of 'quiet diplomacy', the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) is not associated, at a first glance, with civil society. This article analyses the working methods of the HCNM and demonstrates the all but irrelevant contribution of civil society to the successful implementation of the HCNM mandate. The paper first identifies the categories of civil society mostly involved with the work of the HCNM and then illustrates the different forms of involvement of each of them. It focuses, in particular, on two important instruments of the HCNM 'toolbox', the project work and the elaboration of general recommendations, looking at the essential role played by civil society actors. It concludes by maintaining that the role of the conflict prevention mandate of the HCNM has evolved significantly since his early years and that such evolution has effected (and was in turn affected by) substantial contribution from the side of civil society. As a result, a structural triangle of conflict-prevention comprising the HCNM, national authorities and civil society is emerging as reference, even if the balance among the three actors is defined separately in each individual case.

T1  - Sri Lankan Muslims: between ethno-nationalism and the global ummah
AN  - 852899029; 201103312
AB  - Sri Lanka's Sunni Muslims or 'Moors', who make up eight percent of the population, are the country's third largest ethnic group, after the Buddhist Sinhalese (seventy-four per cent) and the Hindu Tamils (eighteen per cent). Although the armed LTTE (Tamil Tiger) rebel movement was defeated militarily by government forces in May 2009, the island's Muslims still face the long-standing external threats of ethno-linguistic Tamil nationalism and pro-Sinhala Buddhist government land and resettlement policies. In addition, during the past decade a sharp internal conflict has arisen within the Sri Lankan Muslim community between locally popular Sufi sheiks and the followers of hostile Islamic reformist movements energised by ideas and resources from the global ummah, or world community of Muslims. This simultaneous combination of 'external' ethno-nationalist rivalries and 'internal' Islamic doctrinal conflict has placed Sri Lanka's Muslims in a double bind: how to defend against Tamil and Sinhalese ethnic hegemonies while not appearing to embrace an Islamist or jihadist agenda. This article first traces the historical development of Sri Lankan Muslim identity in the context of twentieth-century Sri Lankan nationalism and the south Indian Dravidian movement, then examines the recent anti-Sufi violence that threatens to divide the Sri Lankan Muslim community today.

T1  - Greek American Ethnic Identity, Cultural Experience and the "Embodied Language" of Dance: Implications for Counseling
AN  - 1081866062; 201235257
AB  - This ethnographic study aims to contribute to better counseling services for the Greek American population in the U.S. by providing cultural knowledge and insight into one of the smaller ethnic groups that has been overlooked in the literature. More specifically, it explores the role of the "embodied language" of dance in the formation of Greek American ethnic identity and the transmission of sociocultural knowledge and practices. The findings suggest that ethnic dances constitute a significant medium of transmission of cultural knowledge, and socialization into the life of the Greek American community through role modeling and intergenerational contact, as well as opportunity for fellowship and interaction with people who share common practices and traditions. All of the above contribute to a strong identification with the particular community and the development of ethnic identity. Implications for research and theory development in counseling, taking into account the embodied construction of ethnic identity, are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Identity Treat: The Role of Cultural Identifications in Moderating Closure Responses to Foreign Cultural Inflow
AN  - 1023025674; 201223926
AB  - Political theorists of globalization have argued that foreign inflows to a society can give rise to collective-identity closure-social movements aiming to narrow the in-group, and exclude minorities. In this research we investigate whether exposure to the mixing of a foreign culture with one's heritage culture can evoke need for closure, a motive that engenders ethnocentric social judgments. On the basis of a proposed identity threat mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to situations mixing foreign and heritage cultures would evoke need for closure for individuals with low foreign identification but not those with high foreign identification. An experiment with Hong Kong Chinese students varied linguistic and visual cues of Western and Chinese culture and found, as predicted, that exposure to mixed Western/Chinese conditions elevated need for closure for those low in Western identification but not those high in Western identification.

T1  - The Role of Shame as a Mediator Between Anti-Black Racial Identity Attitudes and Negative Affect in a Sample of African American College Students
AN  - 1018353954; 201212773
AB  - A sample of 168 African American undergraduates was surveyed to clarify past findings demonstrating a consistent relationship between endorsing negative attitudes about being African American and experiencing negative affect. Specifically, shame was tested as a mediator between participants' endorsement of preencounter attitudes (i.e., anti-Black attitudes) and both feelings of depression and global self-esteem, respectively. As predicted, shame acted as a complete mediator in both equations. Limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Today, We Are All Ahmadi': Configurations of Heretic Otherness between Lahore and Berlin
AN  - 881461977; 201116433
AB  - The Ahmadis are widely regarded as heterodox in Pakistan, where they have moved after the Partition of British India in 1947, and where they have later been declared by the state as being 'non-Muslim'. Faced with violence and discrimination on a regular basis, they have migrated in large numbers to Europe, including Germany. There, they are free to continue their religious practice, but at the same time have been treated with hostility as they become part of central city life. Faced with suspicion both at home and now in Europe, this article explores the double sense of heterodoxy which the Ahmadis now face, and explores the complex reactions, including media campaigns to which they have given rise in Germany.

T1  - Colonialism and the Indigenous present: an interview with Bonita Lawrence
AN  - 754043934; 201053397
AB  - In this interview, a leading scholar of Indigeneity, Bonita Lawrence, discusses some of the crucial issues facing Native people in Canada today. She reflects on the denial of citizenship arising from the Indian Act's definition of 'Indianness' - which, in Lawrence's words, reduces cultural identity to racial identity. Also examined are the dilemmas of finding common ground between Indigenous struggles against the colonialism of the Canadian settler-state and the anti-racist struggles of Black people and other racialised groups. Exploring the interaction of Black and Indigenous peoples in Canada, it is argued, reveals the limitations of a superficial multiculturalism.

T1  - The Attitude-Behavior Linkage in Behavioral Cascades
AN  - 754040474; 201049607
AB  - The assumption that individual behavior has an antecedent evaluative foundation is an important component of theories in sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. In its simplest form, the antecedent evaluation is a positive or negative attitude toward an object that may affect an individual's object-related behavior. This attitude may be influenced by the attitudes of other persons. The occurrence of such endogenous interpersonal influences, in which persons' attitudes are affected by other persons' attitudes, is among the basic postulates of social psychology. The present article advances work on the attitude-behavior linkage in behavioral cascades by jointly considering two theories: the theory of reasoned-planned action, which emphasizes the deliberative foundations of individuals' object-related behaviors, and social influence network theory, which emphasizes the group dynamics involved in the formation of individuals' attitudes.

T1  - 'Many Nice People': the nation-state, post-Fordism, and the policy norm of flexible ethnic relations in Estonia
AN  - 743055515; 201043245
AB  - This article uses historical research and ethnographic fieldwork to ask how policymakers interpret historical, political, and economic factors to construct inter-ethnic communities that would bring security and economic growth to an enlarged European Union (EU). Focusing on post-Soviet Estonia's ethnic integration policy, the article argues that 'flexibility' applies not only to post-Fordist, individualized subjects, but also to relations between subjects of different nationalities that policymakers want to form organically in service sector employment. The article explains how this policy construction emerged in light of Estonia's historical trajectory from 1991 to 2001 and demonstrates how it conceptually resolved the fundamental tension between the territorialized nation-state and deterritorialized global capitalism. A visual media campaign entitled 'Many Nice People: Integrating Estonia' captured the essence of this construction, which obscured how the Estonian nation-state marginalized minorities while integrating into the EU.

T1  - Generational differences in ethnic and religious attachment and their interrelation. A study among Muslim minorities in the Netherlands
AN  - 743050031; 201031720
AB  - Are there generational differences in ethnic and religious attachment among Muslim minorities in the Netherlands? To answer this question, we assess patterns of ethnic and religious identity and practice as well as their interrelation among Dutch Turks and Moroccans. Classical assimilation theories predict a decline in ethnic attachment over generations, but are less clear on consequences of migration on religious attachment. We use quantitative analysis to test propositions among first and second generation minorities (N = 1,861). Our data indicate that the second generation reports weaker ethnic and religious identities, and engages less in ethno-cultural and religious practices. We do find, however, that religious and ethnic identity become increasingly related for the second generation. These differences can only partly be accounted for by differences in education, employment and life course events. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A longitudinal examination of the role of stereotype threat and racial climate on college outcomes for minorities at elite institutions
AN  - 1417522215; 201331897
AB  - This paper employs hierarchical linear models to explore the long-term effects of stereotype threat on college outcomes for students in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen. Performance burden was negatively related to both grades and social satisfaction with college. Social satisfaction with college was also significantly impacted by students' perception of the campus racial climate. This paper examines the combined impact of performance burden, campus racial climate, cumulative GPA, and social life satisfaction early in college on 4 year graduation rates. Overall, while there are large initial differences in the likelihood of graduating on time for black and Hispanic students relative to whites, these differences are completely explained by assessments of campus racial climate, social life satisfaction, and grades. The findings suggest that interventions to reduce stereotype threat and improve the racial atmosphere on campus may go a long way towards reducing -- and in some cases eliminating -- disparities between racial/ethnic groups in college outcomes.
