AB  - Background: Racism constitutes a barrier towards achieving equitable healthcare as documented in research showing unequal processes of delivering, accessing, and receiving healthcare across countries and healthcare indicators. This review summarizes studies examining how racism is discussed and produced in the process of delivering, accessing and receiving healthcare across various national contexts. Method: The PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews were followed and databases were searched for peer reviewed empirical articles in English across national contexts. No starting date limitation was applied for this review. The end date was December 1, 2020. The review scoped 213 articles. The results were summarized, coded and thematically categorized in regards to the aim. Results: The review yielded the following categories: healthcare users’ experiences of racism in healthcare; healthcare staff’s experiences of racism; healthcare staff’s racial attitudes and beliefs; effects of racism in healthcare on various treatment choices; healthcare staff’s reflections on racism in healthcare and; antiracist training in healthcare. Racialized minorities experience inadequate healthcare and being dismissed in healthcare interactions. Experiences of racism are associated with lack of trust and delay in seeking healthcare. Racialized minority healthcare staff experience racism in their workplace from healthcare users and colleagues and lack of organizational support in managing racism. Research on healthcare staff’s racial attitudes and beliefs demonstrate a range of negative stereotypes regarding racialized minority healthcare users who are viewed as difficult. Research on implicit racial bias illustrates that healthcare staff exhibit racial bias in favor of majority group. Healthcare staff’s racial bias may influence medical decisions negatively. Studies examining healthcare staff’s reflections on racism and antiracist training show that healthcare staff tend to construct healthcare as impartial and that healthcare staff do not readily discuss racism in their workplace. Conclusions: The USA dominates the research. It is imperative that research covers other geo-political contexts. Research on racism in healthcare is mainly descriptive, atheoretical, uses racial categories uncritically and tends to ignore racialization processes making it difficult to conceptualize racism. Sociological research on racism could inform research on racism as it theoretically explains racism’s structural embeddedness, which could aid in tackling racism to provide good quality care. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Physical activity (PA) helps prevention and aftercare of sporadic breast cancer (BC), cardiopulmonary fitness (CPF) being an age-independent predictor of tumor-specific mortality. Therefore, we wanted to identify predictors of CPF (represented by peak oxygen uptake: VO2peak) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers whose risk of developing BC is high. We used cross-sectional data from 68 BRCA1/2 germline mutation carrying women participating in the randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study LIBRE-1. Assessments included cardiopulmonary exercise testing, medical and lifestyle history plus socioeconomic status. Additionally, the participants completed a psychological questionnaire regarding their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control and intention towards PA. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors for participants reaching their age- and sex-adjusted VO2peak reference values. 22 participants (median age: 40 years, interquartile range (IQR) 33–46) were cancer-unaffected and 46 cancer-affected (median age: 44 years, IQR 35–50). The strongest predictor for reaching the reference VO2peak value was attitude towards PA (Odds Ratio 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval 1.3–8.4; p = 0.021). None of the other predictors showed a significant association. A positive attitude towards PA seems to be associated with VO2peak, which should be considered in developing therapeutic and preventive strategies.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify the factors related to treatment adherence behaviors among old-age hemodialysis patients in Hamadan based on the Extended Theory of Planned Behavior (ETPB) during the covid-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2021 in Hamadan, Iran. 191 hemodialysis patients were recruited who were referred to hemodialysis centers via the census method. Data were collected by a questionnaire containing items on socio-demographic information, End-Stage Renal Disease Adherence (ESRD-Adherence) Questionnaire, and ETPB constructs scale. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling. Results: The mean (SD) age of participants was 62.49 (10.66). Also, the mean (SD) hemodialysis vintage/Month of them was 36.56 (43.34). Moreover, Treatment Adherence Behaviors are associated with education level, sex, and marital status (p < 0.001). Besides, Perceive Behavior Control (β = 0.414, t-value = 3.810) associated with intention. Also, intention (β = 0.158, t-value = 1.976) was associated to adherence behaviors. No significant associations were observed between positive attitudes, subjective norms, a perceived threat with intention, and adherence behaviors. The model explained about 54% of the variance of adherence behaviors. Finally, the goodness of fit index of 0.78, indicating the model good fit. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that some of the ETPB constructs such as perceived behavior control and intention are useful to improve adherence among the oldest hemodialysis patients. Also. This framework is revealed alongside the theory of planned behavior (TPB) applicable in the treatment adherence of old-age hemodialysis patients. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: While depressive symptoms are recognized as major mental health problems in later life, there is a lack of study in examining potential moderators in the association between intergenerational support and depressive symptoms, especially in social contexts with low socioeconomic status and inadequate formal public support. This study set out to examine the association between intergenerational support and depressive symptoms among older adults in rural Northeast China, and the potential moderating roles of age, living alone, and number of chronic diseases on this link. Methods: A quota sampling approach was used to recruit 448 respondents aged 60 and above from rural Chinese communities. Depressive symptoms were the dependent variable. Intergenerational emotional, instrumental, and financial support were the main independent variables. Age, living alone, and number of chronic diseases were the moderators. Multiple linear regression models with interaction terms were conducted to test the proposed model. Results: The results showed that intergenerational emotional support was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in older adults when instrumental and financial support and covariates were controlled (β = -0.196, p <.001). Age was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between intergenerational instrumental support and depressive symptoms (β = -0.118, p <.05). Among older respondents aged 74.51 years and older, instrumental support was positively associated with depressive symptoms, but this association was not significant for younger respondents. Furthermore, living alone and number of chronic diseases suffered moderated the association between intergenerational financial support and depressive symptoms, which was statistically significant only for those living alone and with more chronic diseases (interaction term between living alone and intergenerational financial support: β = -0.082, p <.05; interaction term between number of chronic diseases and intergenerational financial support: β = -0.088, p <.05. Conclusions: The findings not only highlight the important role of intergenerational support in promoting mental health in later life in rural Chinese contexts, but also identify within-population heterogeneity in the identified associations. Policy and intervention implications are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The approved COVID-19 vaccines have shown great promise in reducing disease transmission and severity of outcomes. However, the success of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is dependent on public acceptance and willingness to be vaccinated. In this study, we aim to examine how the attitude towards public sector officials and the government impact vaccine willingness. The secondary aim is to understand the impact of ethnicity on vaccine-willingness after we explicitly account for trust in public institutions. Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from a UK population based longitudinal household survey (Understanding Society COVID-19 study, Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study) between April 2020-January 2021. Data from 22,421 participants in Waves 6 and 7 of the study were included after excluding missing data. Demographic details in addition to previous survey responses relating to public sector/governmental trust were included as covariates in the main analysis. A logit model was produced to describe the association between public sector/governmental mistrust and the willingness for vaccination with interaction terms included to account for ethnicity/socio-economic status. Results: In support of existing literature, we identified those from BAME groups were more likely to be unwilling to take the COVID-19 vaccine. We found that positive opinions towards public sector officials (OR 2.680: 95% CI 1.888 – 3.805) and the UK government (OR 3.400; 95% CI 2.454—4.712) led to substantive increase in vaccine willingness. Most notably we identified this effect to vary across ethnicity and socio-economic status with those from South Asian background (OR 4.513; 95% CI 1.012—20.123) and possessing a negative attitude towards public officials and the government being the most unwilling to be vaccinated. Conclusions: These findings suggests that trust in public sector officials play a key factor in the low vaccination rates particularly seen in at-risk groups. Given the additional morbidity/mortality risk posed by COVID-19 to those from lower socio-economic or ethnic minority backgrounds, there needs to be urgent public health action to review how to tailor health promotion advice given to these groups and examine methods to improve trust in public sector officials and the government. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Long-term consequences of comorbid autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are inadequately investigated. Methods: In the 1980s, 51 adolescent-onset AN cases (AN group) and 51 matched controls (COMP group) were recruited from the community. They have been examined on five occasions. The four last assessments included the Morgan-Russell Outcome Assessment Schedule (MROAS) to assess eating disorder outcomes (weight, dieting, menstruation), and related problems including psychiatric, psychosexual and socioeconomic state. In the present study, at age 44, when 30 years had elapsed, MROAS data were compared with previous results. At age 16, 21, 24 and 32 years, all individuals had been assessed regarding ASD. At the 30-year follow-up, the impact of the ASD on the MROAS data was analysed. Results: In the AN group, all core anorectic symptoms (weight, dieting, menstruation) were on a par with the COMP group at the 30-year follow-up, but the positive outcomes were limited to those who had never had an ASD diagnosis. Psychiatric state was significantly worse in the AN group, particularly in the subgroup who had an ASD diagnosis assigned. The AN group—again particularly those with ASD—had a more negative attitude to sexual matters than the COMP group. The AN group had worse outcomes than the COMP group for ‘personal contacts’, ‘social contacts,’ and ‘employment record’ at the 30-year follow-up and the outcomes were worse the more often an ASD diagnosis had been assigned. Limitations: Rare data collection points throughout 30 years (only 5 assessments). ASD was assessed in the first four studies but was not assessed again at the 30-year follow-up. Conclusions: Mental health, psychosexual, and socioeconomic status were compromised up to 30 years after AN onset. Coexisting ASD contributed to the poor outcome. Core anorectic symptoms had “normalised” three decades after AN onset. Plain English summary: Some individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) also suffer from autism. In this study we have investigated outcome of AN 30 years after the onset of AN and whether the presence of autism affects the outcome. Since the 1980s we have followed 51 individuals with teenage-onset AN and 51 healthy controls. They have been examined on five occasions, and an instrument that measures symptoms of AN (weight, dieting, body image), psychiatric symptoms, ability to work, and relationships with partner, family, and friends has been used to assess outcome. Autism was assessed in the first four studies. Symptoms of AN had normalised at 30-year follow-up, but only among those without autism. Psychiatric symptoms, ability to work, and relationships were issues that persisted after 30 years in the AN group, and those who had both autism and a history of AN had even more pronounced problems in these areas. The AN group had a more negative attitude to sexual matters than the control group, the outcome was worse the more often an autism diagnosis had been assigned. Conclusions: Mental health, psychosexual, and socioeconomic status are affected up to 30 years after AN onset, particularly among those with autism. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Can corrective information change citizens' misperceptions about immigrants and subsequently lead to favorable immigration opinions? While prior studies from the USA document how corrections about the size of minority populations fail to change citizens' immigration-related opinions, they do not examine how other facts that speak to immigrants' cultural or economic dependency rates can influence immigration policy opinions. To extend earlier work, we conducted a large-scale survey experiment fielded to a nationally representative sample of Danes. We randomly expose participants to information about non-Western immigrants' (1) welfare dependency rate, (2) crime rate, and (3) proportion of the total population. We find that participants update their factual beliefs in light of correct information, but reinterpret the information in a highly selective fashion, ultimately failing to change their policy preferences. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Introduction: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many treatment courts shifted to offering teleservices. We sought to examine the barriers that clients faced when transitioning to virtual court and treatment, and how this transition impacted their perceptions of the treatment court experience. Methods: The National Center for State Courts administered an online survey between January 1, 2021, and July 31, 2021, deployed to state and local court administrators, which resulted in 1356 unique client responses from 121 courts. The survey measured attitudes about the treatment court process, including interactions with the judge, the behavioral health treatment staff, and treatment groups, as well as barriers to virtual and in-person court. We hypothesized that clients with fewer technological barriers to virtual service, who shifted to virtual court or treatment, would report more positive attitudes to this service delivery. Results: Clients felt more comfortable participating in virtual court sessions than in-person sessions but were less likely to feel like the judge was familiar with their case during virtual court sessions. From the treatment perspective, clients felt more connected with other group members and reported greater benefit from treatment staff when treatment services were delivered in-person, but clients felt less anxious when treatment groups were virtual. Conclusions: Even though virtual experiences were more comfortable than in-person experiences for clients, the results are nuanced and show preference for some in-person connections as they transitioned to virtual connections. Future research should examine how to improve client connections with staff/group members during virtual court or treatment sessions, particularly as courts and treatment providers are likely to continue some services virtually into the future. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent data reveals that some White Americans perceive increasing levels of discrimination against their racial ingroup (i.e., reverse racism) and are resentful toward racial minorities (i.e., racial resentment). Using the theoretical framework of the Socially Mediated Stereotyping Model, the present research examines how social media use and political identity collectively influence these perceptions. A three-wave longitudinal study finds that both Time 1 engagement with politics on social media (negatively) and a more conservative political identity (positively) influence Time 2 racial resentment, which subsequently increased Time 3 beliefs in reverse racism. Additional tests of indirect effects find a significant negative relationship of engagement with politics on social media and a marginally significant positive relationship of higher conservative political identity on reverse racism via racial resentment. These results reflect how social media use and social identity-based motivations affect perceptions related to existing group hierarchies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social scientists in a variety of fields have long relied on economic-structuralist theories to understand the ascendance and hegemony of the modern Conservative Movement in the United States. In the materialist theory of political change (MTPC), structural crisis in the 1970s destabilized Keynesian-managerialism, and paved the way for neoliberalism. Key weaknesses of this approach include its relatively aspatial scope - comparatively less attention to the spatial variation of neoliberalism's popularity - and its demotion of other elements of the Conservative Movement into a veritable super-structure of secondary movements. This paper offers a racial amendment to the MTPC, and an application to electoral geographies in the state of Ohio since 1932. This amendment synthesizes group threat theory, critical historiography, and Du Boisian theories of Whiteness to suggest that the growing influence of suburban conservatism is not reducible simply to class interest. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Research finds that the perception that immigrants are culturally and economically threatening is associated with negative attitudes toward immigration. In a largely separate body of work, psychophysiological predispositions toward threat sensitivity are connected to a range of political attitudes, including immigration. This article draws together these two literatures, using a lab experiment to explore psychophysiological threat sensitivity and immigration attitudes in the United States. Respondents with higher threat sensitivity, as measured by skin conductance responses to threatening images, tend to be less supportive of immigration. This finding builds on our understanding of the sources of anti-immigrant attitudes. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Immigration is an important and contemporary topic in management education given its impact on labor, wages, innovation, and diversity. However, extant research offers few insights into the antecedents to student immigration attitudes. Survey data from undergraduate students taking business courses at two large public universities in the southeast U.S. reveal that while student attitudes toward immigration are more moderate than the general U.S. population, these attitudes differ by gender, political affiliation, and immigration background. Following realistic conflict theory and social identity theory, these student immigration attitudes are a function of both fear and competition. First, their attitudes are confounded by conflicting antecedents in perceived personal competition for resources with immigrants (e.g., jobs, wages) versus immigration benefits (e.g., costs, labor base, innovation). Second, xenophobia (fear of immigrants) is a remarkably powerful influencer of one’s immigration attitude and its antecedents. With these points, management educators must engage students in critical thinking about immigration to prepare them to effectively work with diverse colleagues and business partners while leading global organizations. We, therefore, present four cross-disciplinary areas of intersection between immigration and management education, including diversity and cultural intelligence, human resource management and ethics, entrepreneurship and innovation, and finally, economic and socioeconomic impacts. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The current study sought to understand the influence of cultural values on mental health attitudes and help-seeking behaviors in college students of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Asian and Latinx college students (N = 159) completed an online survey in which they reported on their adherence to cultural values as measured by ethnicity-specific cultural values and general attitudes towards mental health. Factor analysis revealed two common factors of cultural values irrespective of ethnicity: Interdependent Orientation (IO) and Cultural Obligation (CO). Regardless of ethnicity, the more students endorsed IO values, the less likely they were to perceive a need for mental health treatment. IO value adherence was also predictive of more negative attitudes towards mental health. CO values were not predictive of perceived need or help-seeking behaviors. Findings highlight the importance of understanding shared cultural values across ethnic-racial groups and considering how the multidimensionality of culture may help explain shared mental health behaviors crossing lines of ethnic group membership. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study leverages population registry data from Sweden to examine whether immigrants who live in areas with a high concentration of ethnic minorities are more or less likely to be nominated for political office. It exploits a refugee placement program in place in Sweden during the late 1980s and early 1990s that restricted refugees' opportunities to freely choose their place of residence. The article presents evidence that immigrants who live in areas with a high ethnic density are less likely to be nominated for political office. The findings have important implications for local integration policies as well as refugee placement policies, as many countries consider local context when resettling refugees.

AB  - Geoengineering technologies are increasingly proposed as a necessary strategy to address climate change. How does the prospect of these technologies affect public support for traditional mitigation strategies that involve emission reductions? Recent research yields mixed results. Some evidence points to a moral hazard or risk compensation effect (i.e., less support for climate change mitigation). Other research finds evidence of heightened risk salience (i.e., more support for climate change mitigation), and still other work finds no effect at all. Focusing on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, we investigate whether these inconsistent findings result from differences in how the technologies are described against the backdrop of climate change. Specifically, we examine whether including explicit information (or not) about the impacts of climate change alters how information about CDR is received. Building on previous work, we designed two experiments to elucidate the circumstances under which information about CDR elicits a risk compensatory, risk salience, or null response among the public. Results predominantly align with a null effect from CDR information, although mixed results in Study 1 suggest the possibility of a very small risk compensation effect, depending on whether political ideology is controlled for. There was no evidence of a risk salience effect. However, information about the impacts of climate change increased perceived threat and, indirectly, policy support. We, thus, recommend that future studies of risk compensation and risk salience effects account for the provision of climate impacts information and political ideology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The success of urban forest management strategies is dependent on public support for and engagement with urban trees. Satisfaction with urban trees and their management, and the level of trust people have in urban tree managers, are useful for understanding public opinions. Yet these concepts, and the mechanisms leading to the formation of public opinions remain poorly explored in the literature. Here we explore how satisfaction with urban trees and with urban tree management, and trust in the agencies responsible for urban tree management, are explained by cognitive factors (values, beliefs, and knowledge) and socio-ecological contextual factors (tree presence/canopy cover, cultural diversity, and socioeconomic status) using an online survey of 16 local government areas in south-eastern Australia. Analyses of 2367 responses revealed that people's opinions about trees in general (values and beliefs) were overwhelmingly positive, while their opinions about more contextualised measures such as satisfaction and trust were more mixed. Two distinct pathways that influence satisfaction were identified: one linked to beliefs about having trees in cities, and another one linked to trust in urban tree management. At the local government level, satisfaction was negatively associated with a measure of cultural diversity and very low levels of tree canopy cover, but not with socioeconomic disadvantage. Satisfaction with local trees could be improved by increasing the quality of ecological function of trees, such as habitat provision and tree diversity. Community engagement could also improve satisfaction and trust, particularly perceived procedural fairness of decision-making, reinforce positive beliefs about the outcomes of having trees in cities, and dispel negative beliefs. Engagement processes should recognise that people hold complex and diverse opinions about urban trees, and by incorporating these opinions into decision-making we can meet the increasingly complex and diverse expectations being placed on urban forests. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Intergroup conflict profoundly affects the welfare of groups and can deteriorate intergroup relations long after the conflict is over. Here, we experimentally investigate how the experience of an intergroup conflict influences the ability of groups to establish cooperation after conflict. We induced conflict by using a repeated attacker-defender game in which groups of four are divided into two ‘attackers’ that can invest resources to take away resources from the other two participants in the role of ‘defenders.’ After the conflict, groups engaged in a repeated public goods game with peer-punishment, in which group members could invest resources to benefit the group and punish other group members for their decisions. Previous conflict did not significantly reduce group cooperation compared to a control treatment in which groups did not experience the intergroup conflict. However, when having experienced an intergroup conflict, individuals punished free-riding during the repeated public goods game less harshly and did not react to punishment by previous attackers, ultimately reducing group welfare. This result reveals an important boundary condition for peer punishment institutions. Peer punishment is less able to efficiently promote cooperation amid a ‘shadow of conflict.’ In a third treatment, we tested whether such ‘maladaptive’ punishment patterns induced by previous conflict can be mitigated by hiding the group members’ conflict roles during the subsequent public goods provision game. We find more cooperation when individuals could not identify each other as (previous) attackers and defenders and maladaptive punishment patterns disappeared. Results suggest that intergroup conflict undermines past perpetrators’ legitimacy to enforce cooperation norms. More generally, results reveal that past conflict can reduce the effectiveness of institutions for managing the commons. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective: Religion has been shown to affect the U.S. public opinion about foreign policy. Recent studies emphasize attitudes about issues pertaining to the Middle East. They also tend to focus on the perspectives of evangelical Protestants, so we know comparatively little about how being mainline Protestant, Black Protestant, Catholic, or religiously unaffiliated might affect one's foreign policy preferences. Methods: Using data drawn from the 2009 America's Place in the World General Public Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, we analyze religion's impact on public attitudes about foreign affairs, comparing evangelical Protestants with four other religious groups. Results: We find that the main driver of religion's impact on foreign policy attitudes is nominal religious affiliation (“belonging”), not the frequency of worship attendance (“behaving”). Religiously unaffiliated Americans and Catholics—and to a lesser extent, mainline and Black Protestants—perceive the world as less threatening than do evangelicals. They also prefer multilateral, cooperative solutions to international problems. Conclusion: Americans vary significantly in their international threat perception and support for militant or cooperative internationalism based on their religious affiliation. In addition, evangelical Protestants’ preference for hawkish, unilateral foreign policy extends beyond the context of the Middle East. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Our research centers the underexamined perspective of Black Americans regarding allyship behaviors and investigates their perceptions and experience of a White ally who confronts a White perpetrator of prejudice. In two experimental studies (N = 1176), we found that Black participants reported higher levels of self-esteem after a White ally confronted a White perpetrator of racial prejudice compared to no confrontation. Additionally, we found that White ally confrontations that signaled intrinsic motivations (i.e., driven by personal values) were perceived as less suspicious in motive than those that signaled extrinsic motivations (i.e., driven by image concerns), which related to more target self-esteem. We discuss implications for research on allyship and confrontation as well as practical considerations. Our results strongly suggest that advantaged group members cannot allow overt prejudice to stand unchecked and should consider the motivations they convey in their actions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an “intervention tournament” which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (N = 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19—including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidence—were implemented to identify which framings would “win” in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19. © 2022

AB  - The discrepancy between ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility is well established in social psychology. Under which conditions does “ingroup love” turn into “outgroup hate”? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. In two preregistered experiments, we test the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We use the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). The preliminary findings suggest that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism, more weak parochialism, more universal cooperation, and less strong parochialism. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between “ingroup love” and “outgroup hate”. The third and final preregistered study aims to replicate these findings in a different cultural setting and test the mediating role of trust in this process. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: U.S. residents had varying experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and social safety net policy in 2020. Past research has suggested that partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and personal experience may each influence policy attitudes. In this study, we explore whether variation in support for social safety net policy in 2020 is predicted by negative experiences of the pandemic when controlling for racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology. Methods: Support for 12 social safety net policies in 2020 was estimated using data from a nationally representative panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in 2020 (n=1,222). Logistic regression was used to examine differences in the predicted probability of supporting a majority of social safety net policies related to health, housing, and employment by partisanship, ideology, racial attitudes, and negative experiences of the pandemic. Analyses were conducted in 2021. Results: Higher levels of symbolic racism was a consistently strong predictor of lower social safety net policy support across health, housing, and employment policies; as was identifying as either Conservative or Republican. Negative experiences of the pandemic were generally unpredictive of support for the social safety net policy. Conclusions: Despite the pandemic's consequences as well as the potential for social safety net policy to address these consequences, negative experiences of the pandemic failed to predict policy support, even as racial attitudes, partisanship, and ideology strongly predicted these preferences in 2020. Building public support for social safety net policy requires communication strategies that identify the shared benefits of these policies. © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB  - A range of studies suggest that singing activities with young children can have a beneficial impact on other aspects of their development. However, there is little research examining the relationship between young children's singing and their developing social identity. In the current study, data were captured of young children's singing and social identity as part of a larger-scale, longitudinal evaluation of the nationwide Sing Up programme in England. Participants were 720 children aged 5-8 years old. The assessment of young children's singing ability employed an established measure and was undertaken individually. With adult support, the children were also asked to complete a simple questionnaire that focused on selected aspects of their social identity, both in general terms and also related to singing. Key themes embraced their attitudes to singing (at home, in school and in informal settings), singer identity (emotional engagement with singing and self-concept), and perceptions of self (self-efficacy, self-esteem, social integration). Comparative data were collected from young children of a similar age outside the programme. Findings suggested that the programme had a positive impact on children's singing ability, both overall and including the youngest children. The data analyses suggest that children could be identified as either “pupils with positive singing identity” or “pupils with less positive, or still developing singing identity.” Overall, pupils with a more positive singer identity—irrespective of Sing Up-related experience—tended to report more positive attitudes toward singing at school and other settings, had higher perceived levels of self-esteem and social integration, as well as more positive evaluations of their singing ability. Furthermore, the research suggests that successful participation in high-quality singing activities is likely to have a positive impact on young children's singing ability and, by implication, such positive singing development will also be associated with aspects of self that are related to contexualised singer identity and their sense of social inclusion.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccination has changed the landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, decreased uptake due to vaccine hesitancy has been observed, particularly in patients from minority ethnic backgrounds and socially deprived areas. These patient characteristics are common in patients on Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT), a population at extremely high risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19 and who would thus benefit the most from the vaccination programme. We designed a bespoke COVID-19 vaccination programme for our RRT population with the aim of decreasing health inequalities and increasing vaccination uptake. Methods: Key interventions included addressing vaccine hesitancy by deploying the respective clinical teams as trusted messengers, prompt eligible patient identification and notification, the deployment of resources to optimise vaccine administration in a manner convenient to patients, and the timely collection and analysis of local safety and efficacy data. First, COVID-19 vaccination data in relation to ethnicity and social deprivation in our RRT population, measured by the multiple deprivation index, were analysed and compared to uptake data in the total regional adult clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) population in Greater Manchester (GM). Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the factors associated with not receiving a vaccine. Results: Out of 1156 RRT patients included in this analysis, 96.7% received the first dose of the vaccination compared to 93% in the cohort of CEV patients in the GM. Age, gender, ethnicity, and a lower index of multiple deprivation were not identified as significant risk factors for poor first dose vaccine uptake in our cohort. Vaccine uptake in Asian and Black RRT patients was 94.9% and 92.3%, respectively, compared to 93% and 76.2% for the same ethnic groups in the reference CEV GM. Vaccine uptake was 96.1% for RRT patients in the lowest quartile of the multiple deprivation index, compared to 90.5% in the GM reference population. Conclusion: Bespoke COVID-19 vaccination programmes based on local clinical teams as trusted messengers can improve negative attitudes towards vaccination and reduce health inequalities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - THIS ARTICLE USES WORDS OR LANGUAGE THAT IS CONSIDERED PROFANE, VULGAR, OR OFFENSIVE BY SOME READERS. The new generation of direct-acting antivirals has improved dramatically the rates of cure for chronic hepatitis C. Yet, evidence shows that racial groups are deemed more often ineligible for hepatitis C treatment, despite no clinical evidence supporting differential treatment for Black and White patients. One possible explanation has to do with providers’ racial biases. This investigation sought to explore medical students’ racial stereotypes (Study 1, N = 171) and the role of stereotypical cues on perceptions of medical adherence of Black and White patients (Study 2, N = 208). In Study 1, we first sought to identify health-related aspects that are consistently associated with Blacks as part of a stereotype. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated racial stereotypes identified in Study 1 by asking participants to read a clinical vignette depicting a patient (Black vs. White) and their medical history (cause of exposure to hepatitis C: unprotected sex vs. non-injectable drugs use). The results show that the impact of stereotypicality on patient perceived compliance varies as a function of medical students’ racial prejudice. Implications for further applied health inequalities research and for medical training are discussed. © 2022 Madeira et al.

AB  - The Arab ethnic community in Israel is characterized by low social economic status and is at risk due to the typically crowded households. Understanding parents’ level of awareness is important to avoid new outbreaks. Objectives: This study seeks to identify predicting factors associated with perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted through social media, using snowball sampling via social networks. Addi-tionally, t-tests, Chi-square tests, and Z tests were used to evaluate differences between independent proportions. Pearson correlations were calculated for the study variables. Multiple logistic regression examined the extent to which the background variables were related to the intention to vaccinate the child. Results: A total of 2843 Arab parents participated in the study. Older parents, higher socioeconomic status, higher trust in the authorities, vaccinated parents, and low psychological and physical barriers were positively correlated with willingness to vaccinate children. Pandemic fatigue was associated with less positive attitudes and reduced perceived effectiveness toward vaccination. Conclusion: Addressing minorities’ poor standards of living and physical and psychological barriers posed by the authorities to minorities’ access to vaccination may increase compliance with COVID-19 vaccination and protect the health of the entire population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A person’s gender and age can influence their attitudes towards animal welfare, with more benign attitudes generally ascribed to women. Given that attitudes influence consumer behaviour and the rapid recent social development in China (globally the biggest livestock producer), we surveyed over 1300 individuals across China to elucidate the role of gender and age in determining attitudes towards animals. Respondents self-identified their gender as male, female, other or not revealed. There were interactions between age and gender for many of the survey items, demonstrating that the effects of gender were dependent on the respondents’ age. Women aged 18–24 reported more benign attitudes towards animals than older men (aged between 25 and 54 years, depending on the survey question) and more empathetic responses were found in young respondents generally, although this did not necessarily translate into a willingness to pay more for higher-welfare animal products. We propose, drawing on Social Identity Theory, that women see animals as part of their social group, whereas men tend not to do this. Those responding as neither male nor female, i.e., as another gender, and those not revealing their gender appeared to have different relationships to animals than those responding as men or women. It is concluded that within Chinese culture, attitudes towards animals and their welfare are complex and influenced by an interaction between gender and age. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Research on political homophily has almost exclusively focused on adults, and little is known about whether political homophily is present early in life when political attitudes are forming and friendship networks are rapidly changing. We examined political homophily using a social network approach with rural middle school students (N = 213; mean age = 12.5 years; 57% female) from a remote U.S. community. Preregistered analyses indicated that early adolescents were more likely to spend time with people who shared similar political attitudes and values. These effects were most consistent for right-wing authoritarianism, patriotism, and anti-immigration attitudes. Our results show that political homophily is evident at an early age when young people are forming their political beliefs and making decisions about their friendships, suggesting that peer political-attitude socialization may emerge early in life. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Although White Americans increasingly express egalitarian views, how they express egalitarianism may reveal inegalitarian tendencies and sow mistrust with Black Americans. In the present experiments, Black perceivers inferred likability and trustworthiness and accurately inferred underlying racial attitudes and motivations from White writers’ declarations that they are nonprejudiced and egalitarian (Experiments 1 and 2). White writers believed that their egalitarianism seemed more inoffensive and indicative of allyship than was perceived by Black Americans (Experiment 1a). Linguistic analysis revealed that, when inferring racial attitudes and motivations, Black perceivers accurately attended to language emphasizing humanization, support for equal opportunity, personal responsibility, and the idea that equality already exists (Experiment 1b). We found causal evidence that these linguistic cues informed Black Americans’ perceptions of White egalitarians (Experiment 2). Suggesting societal costs of these perceptions, White egalitarians’ underlying racial beliefs negatively predicted Black participants’ actual trust and cooperation in an economic game (Experiment 3). Our experiments (N = 1,335 adults) showed that White Americans’ insistence that they are egalitarian itself perpetuates mistrust with Black Americans. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Renewable energy development is a widely and intensively discussed topic, though it is still unclear which exactly variables may influence people's evaluation of the phenomenon. There is a need to study the general public's knowledge, emotions, and cognitions linked to energy technologies especially in the context of advanced inventions. Social media is a powerful communication tool which has a huge impact on studying public opinions. This study aims to describe linguistic connections through an analysis of 1500 Instagram posts, assuming and interpreting emotional and/or cognitive words. Using a socio-cognitive approach, this research explores the salient words under a set of pre-specified renewable energy technology (RET) hashtags. Building on the appraisal theories of emotions, this research investigates the coexistence of several energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal) and powerlines. The results showed the highest linguistic interconnection between solar and wind energy posts. Furthermore, powerlines were not linguistically connected to the RETs, as they are not included in the schema or not salient when people write posts about renewable energy. Solar, wind, and geothermal posts evoked more emotional and positive emotions than the other RETs and powerlines. Instead, biomass posts had a high frequency of cognitive processes and causal words. Powerline posts were linked to the words of risk, body, health, and biological process showing a great concern for health and perceived threat. These differences in the words used can be a guide to understanding peoples' reactions and communication for each of the energy sources. This study, taking both emotions and cognitions into account, explains different types of considerations towards energy projects. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Group-living primates exhibit variable reactions to intergroup encounters (or IGEs), reflecting species-specific strategies and individual motivations. In chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), dominating in IGEs provides fitness benefits. Less is known about responses to IGEs in bonobos (Pan paniscus) despite their equal relevance for understanding the origins of human intergroup relations. We observed the Bompusa West (WBp) bonobo community at LuiKotale during a 2-month shift in ranging resulting in frequent IGEs with the smaller Bompusa East (EBp) community. We tested whether incursions provided ecological benefits, and whether responses to IGEs were consistent with inter-community dominance or tolerance. We measured fruit availability and collected activity scans from 26 mature WBp community members when in their core ranging area, during incursions into the EBp ranging area, and during IGEs. We collected data on sexual interactions and aggression with in-group and out-group members during 19 independent IGEs. During their shift in ranging, fruit availability was greater in the EBp ranging area, and WBp bonobos consumed more fruit during incursions than when in their core ranging area. Coalitionary intergroup aggression occurred during nine IGEs, and outcomes were consistent with imbalances in fighting power, in that larger WBp parties supplanted smaller EBp parties from the immediate area. However, communities reformed associations following 70% of coalitionary conflicts, and prolonged IGEs facilitated out-group sexual interactions and female transfers. The WBp community shift in ranging was likely motivated by ecological factors and responses to increased IGEs reflected a mixture of competitive and tolerant strategies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The emergence of “new” sexualities inflicted lots of confusions among Basotho. It is not surprising, therefore, that diverse attitudes towards these minority populations were also likely to emerge. Families and peers (or friends) also demonstrated diverse attitudes towards the minority population. This qualitative, evidence-based paper tapped into social constructivism to explore peer and family attitudes (rejection or acceptance) towards sexually diverse populations. Data for the study were collected from community dialogues of approximately 50 members. The study revealed peers and parental support as key to living positively as LGBTQI. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Racial equality requires coalitions and solidarity across racial groups, but there continues to be racially colorblind and anti-Black attitudes within the Asian American community, a diverse community consisting of individuals with ancestral origins in East, Southeast, and South Asia. However, there is limited research on the factors that contribute to the development of these attitudes among Asian Americans. Parents could potentially play an important role in perpetuating or challenging the colorblind and anti-Black messages that pervade U.S. society. Thus, the current study investigates how 309 Asian American adolescents’ (M age = 16.8; SD = 1.15; 50.5% female) perceptions of parents’ racial socialization messages about race and racism relate to the youth’s racial attitudes. Latent profiles of youth’s perceptions of mothers’ and fathers’ racial socialization messages and their associations with colorblind racial attitudes and anti-Black attitudes were examined. For mothers, three socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant, Race Hesitant, and Race Embracing; for fathers, two socialization profiles were identified: Race Avoidant and Race Embracing. Adolescents with Race Embracing mothers reported less anti-Black attitudes compared to those who had Race Hesitant mothers. For fathers, there were no differences among the profiles and anti-Black attitudes. However, surprisingly, adolescents with Race Embracing fathers were more likely to have colorblind racial attitudes compared to those with Race Avoidant fathers. The findings highlight the importance of racial socialization in the development of Asian American adolescents’ racial attitudes to continue fighting for interracial solidarity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti-immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right-Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Scholarship in American politics finds whites’ racial resentment and status threat predict their vote choice. However, research in social identity indicates that such variables should negatively correlate with participation, attenuating resentful whites’ political power. We resolve this contradiction by studying these variables interactively, using data from the 2012, 2016, and 2020 American National Election Studies. Our primary independent variables are racial resentment and a measure of relative discrimination that captures whites’ perceptions of inequality relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Both constituent variables are negatively associated with participation. Interactively, they are positively associated with political participation. These relationships persist when we predict voter turnout, an index measuring non-electoral participation, and an index measuring civic engagement. In 2012, our interaction term moderates the negative impact of racial resentment in relative discrimination. In elections contested by Donald Trump, our interaction term has a positive substantive effect. Our findings advance scholarship on white political behavior. First, they identify a relationship between whites’ racial attitudes and participation, advancing a research program that primarily examines vote choice. Second, they clarify the relationship between different white racial attitudes. Next, they detail the conditional relationship between whites’ prejudice and politics and how it has changed over time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent changes in the sociopolitical US landscape calls for the examination of the level of quantitative misperception about undocumented immigration and its connection with immigration attitudes. Nationally representative survey data are used to analyze whether being misinformed about the proportion of US immigrants that are undocumented in 2015 is linked with abstract immigration attitudes and four immigration policy options in 2016. The results reveal that people who overestimated undocumented immigration—a common misperception—are more likely to report that all immigrants present symbolic threats to the country than are their accurately informed peers. Consistent with the especially high salience of the US–Mexico wall in this period, overestimators also place more importance on building the wall but not on other policy options. These findings have important theoretical and real-world implications, given the current social and political context and spillover effects on Latinx and other racialized communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Australia’s pro-immigration policies have played a vital role in national population growth, serving to address what would otherwise be chronic labour shortages and population ageing. While migrants to Australian have shown a clear preference for cities and tend to locate with co-ethnics, variations by visa class—employment, family reunification, and asylum—have yet to be fully explored. This paper aims to identify variations in settlement patterns of immigrants in Australia by visa types and the factors underpinning these choices, paying particular attention to ethnic networks and employment opportunities. We apply a series of negative binomial regressions to aggregate census data linked to visa status. At the suburb level, our results show the importance of the presence of compatriots in shaping the location choices of family migrants, with the exception of skilled and humanitarian immigrants from China, Malaysia and Thailand. At the regional level, skilled migrants, including skilled regional migrants, respond to employment opportunities to a greater extent than family and humanitarian migrants. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examined the role of racial attitudes in a diverse high school setting. Teachers and students were recruited from a public charter high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The final sample consisted of 19 students and 10 teachers who participated in face-to-face interviews regarding racial attitudes and racial bias in the academic setting. Three themes emerged among the teacher interviews: rejecting racial inequalities, contradicting thoughts and color-blind explanations, and racially conscious explanations. For the student interviews, two themes emerged: color-blind racial attitudes and witnessing/experiencing bias. These findings yield evidence that color-blind racial attitudes are prevalent in diverse schools among students and teachers, presenting a challenge to intervention efforts in schools aimed at promoting racial justice. © 2022 Society for Research on Adolescence.

AB  - Background: Culturally diverse schools contribute to adolescents’ intergroup relations. Complex and inclusive social identities are mechanisms that can explain the link between structural school cultural diversity (i.e., proportion of students of immigrant descent and the number of different ethnic groups) and positive intergroup relations. We expected that similar mechanisms might be at play linking cultural diversity approaches in schools with adolescents’ intergroup relations. Aim: We examined the link between two sub-dimensions of cultural diversity approaches (i.e., equal treatment; heritage and intercultural learning) and adolescents’ prosocial intentions and behaviour towards refugee youth. Then, we explored the mediating role of identity inclusiveness (i.e., perceived similarity of the self with others). Sample and methods: We sampled culturally diverse eighth grade adolescents from 54 classrooms in Berlin (N = 503, Mage = 13.76 years, 50.6% female). Surveys measured perceived cultural diversity norms, adolescents’ perceived identity inclusiveness with refugee youth, prosocial intentions to support refugee youth, and willingness to donate to a project for refugee youth. Results: Multilevel models revealed that adolescents’ perception of heritage and intercultural learning predicted adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, but not their willingness to donate. Equal treatment was not a significant predictor of adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, or their willingness to donate. Identity inclusiveness did not mediate the relation between cultural diversity approaches and prosocial intentions. However, identity inclusiveness did positively relate adolescents’ prosocial intentions and willingness to donate. Conclusions: We conclude that culturally diverse schools that engage in heritage and intercultural learning might help to promote positive relations between local and refugee youth in schools and society. Fostering inclusive identities may enhance local adolescent’s prosocial intention and behaviour. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Anti-immigration public opinions have become a central public policy issue. Based on the World Value Survey datasets, this research examines the factors affecting attitudes toward immigrants from an international comparative perspective. Our analysis provides supporting evidence for the collective threat theory, showing that the perceptions of economic, cultural, and security threats are closely correlated with discriminatory attitudes against immigrants. While national identity and political conservatism lead to hostility, the role of religiosity is more complex. In particular, religious affiliation and attendance reduce antagonism, but the centrality and exclusivism of religiosity promote ignorance. Anti-immigration attitudes coexist with other discriminatory ideologies, such as traditional gender ideas, and they are negatively correlated with altruism. Our research implies that sociotropic concerns are likely to be more important in understanding the formation of immigration attitudes than are individual socioeconomic statuses. © 2021, Fudan University.

AB  - The presidency of Donald Trump and subsequent interest in issues related to immigration have created controversy regarding how to refer to immigrants living in the USA without documentation. The first part of this paper acts as an analysis of the growing use of the term “illegal immigrant” and the controversy around this term. Given the current debate over using the term “illegal immigrant” versus “undocumented immigrant,” we test the claim that the term “illegal immigrant” causes Americans to support more restrictive immigration policies and view immigrants less favorably. Using Amazon Turk, we distributed two sets of opinion surveys regarding unlawful immigrants. These surveys were identical except that one set used the term “illegal immigrant” and the other used “undocumented immigrant.” The differences in responses between these two survey sets were analyzed. While the term “illegal immigrant” is generally used in more negative contexts than the term “undocumented immigrant,” using one term over the other had little to no effect on how our study participants viewed immigration policy and immigrants themselves. Given prior research about the usage of the two terms, these results suggest that while the decision to use one term over the other is an indication of political ideology, attempts to sway opinion about immigration policy using only terminology may be less effectual than normally believed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Literature devoted to understanding the experiences of individuals who do not fit the cultural mold—those who belong to minority, stigmatized, or underrepresented groups—demonstrates that nonnormative status goes hand in hand with a range of negative outcomes. The current research considers a heretofore unstudied correlate of nonnormative status: existential isolation (the feeling of being alone in one’s subjective experience), which differs from feelings of interpersonal isolation (feeling alone with regard to the quantity or quality of one’s relationships). Normative, or mainstream, society may not acknowledge the experiences of those holding a nonnormative status, rendering such individuals at risk of developing heightened feelings of existential isolation. Across Studies 1a and 1b, we found consistently higher trait levels of existential isolation (but not interpersonal isolation) among people with a nonnormative group status than among their normative counterparts. This effect appeared whether we looked at nonnormativeness with regard to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, citizenship, native language, body weight, religious affiliation, or socioeconomic status. Study 2 highlights one correlate of the existential isolation that accompanies nonnormativeness: decreased certainty with respect to judgments of racism. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed, including addressing the correlational nature of this research and testing potential mechanisms to explain the link between nonnormative status and existential isolation. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We examined the idea that endorsement of state-level restrictive language policies can be understood as an ingroup-preserving behaviour driven by majority group members’ experiences of linguistic-based collective angst (i.e., concern about the future vitality of the ingroup’s language). We did so in the context of legislative reform aimed to enforce monolinguistic public education in Ukraine – a linguistically heterogeneous nation-state with a history of a foreign ethno-political domination. Specifically, we hypothesized that collective angst is most likely to be experienced when majority group members feel higher attachment to Ukraine (vs. glorification) and shared beliefs about historical linguicide of the Ukrainian language. Using data from a public opinion survey (N = 774), we found support for the mediation model – higher attachment and beliefs about historical linguicide predicted increased support for restrictive policies directly and through collective angst, whereas glorification was found to be a non-significant predictor in this relation. Our results highlight the role of the specific content of protagonists’ social identities in predicting their support for cultural assimilation of ethnic minority groups within heterogeneous societies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objectives: We apply Unnever and Cullen’s (2010) Racial Animus Model to examine support for punitive counter-terrorism policies before and after the 2019 Christchurch terrorist attack. Methods: We utilize a natural experiment of survey data from Australians before (n = 1191) and after (n = 1344) the attack. Both surveys included a between-groups vignette describing a terrorist as either a right-wing or Islamic extremist. We examined if support for counter-terrorism policies differed between the two conditions and two surveys. We tested whether perceiving Muslims as threatening predicted support for punitive policies, and if the attack mitigated this association. Results: Participants were more supportive of punitive policies when a terrorist was motivated by Islamic extremism, but only in the pre-Christchurch sample. Those who perceived Muslims as threatening were more supportive of such policies, but this association was weaker among post-Christchurch participants. Conclusions: Results support the Racial Animus Model and suggest that empathy might play a role in weakening anti-Muslim animus. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The failure of large-scale resettlement policies has been largely determined by the collective resistance of residents. For migrants who must leave their original residence and get resettled, mass media and interpersonal communication are important sources to get policy information, which affects their attitudes and responses to resettlement policies. Existing studies have provided two pathways to explain the influencing mechanism between information sources and people’s collective resistance intention. One of these pathways focuses on trust in government and the other highlights perceived benefits. However, it is still unclear how to predict migrants’ collective resistance intention based on different information sources within these two pathways. By concentrating on the policy domain of Chinese resettlement projects, this study aims to develop an integrated, theoretical framework to explore the causal paths between information sources and migrants’ collective resistance intention. Based on a survey of three towns in Ankang, China, we tested the causal mechanism with a structural equation model. The results demonstrate that the pathway that involves trust in government is more explanatory in illustrating the causal mechanism than the pathway of perceived benefits, and interpersonal communication yields stronger effects than mass media in mitigating migrants’ collective resistance intention. The implications for resettlement policy publicity and trust-building in China are discussed. Points for practitioners: Public communication is a critical competency for public managers. Public managers are recommended to flexibly apply various information sources to communicate with migrants in order to eventually mitigate their collective resistance intention by strengthening their trust in government, as well as their perceived benefits. In the early stages of policy publicity, a variety of mass media are needed to inform the migrants of resettlement policies. Then, at the stage of policy implementation, the primary focus becomes interpersonal communication that offers sufficiently detailed information. In this regard, local government managers should carry out more programs that entail face-to-face information sharing to help participants understand the resettlement policy, and encourage them to explain it to their family and friends. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The burgeoning Latinx communities in the U.S. South provide rich case studies for examining the identity formation and group consciousness of children of Latin American immigrants. This paper explores the identities and sense of belonging of 1.5-and second-generation Latinxs who have come of age in Tennessee, a Southern state that has experienced a surge in immigration from Latin America in recent decades. In-depth interviews with Latinxs who have grown up in Tennessee reveal how these individuals contemplate their identities in relation to questions of belonging to (and within) U.S. society. A shift toward developing a reactive ethnicity is evident as Latinxs convey how perceived interpersonal discrimination coupled with recent national and local anti-immigrant policies drive ethnic group solidarity. These factors influence individual life choices and encourage participation in social and political activism. Such reactions will have long-term ramifications for local Southern societies. © 2022, Florida Gulf Coast University. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article investigates the determinants of individual support for independence in Montenegro. We outline five theoretically distinct groups of factors covered by the literature and evaluate their impact on individual preference for independence. Using observational data obtained from a nationally representative survey conducted in Montenegro in 2003-2004, we find support for several hypotheses, showing that identity, income, and partisanship significantly impact individual opinion about independence. We also investigate and discuss the relative effect size of different factors associated with preference for independence. Additionally, we test variables with hitherto unexplored implications for opinions on independence, including the impact of support for EU membership, as well as support for democratic principles. Our logistic regression analyses reveal that attitudes towards EU integration and minority rights are strongly associated with support for independence. By systematically analyzing existing and new hypotheses with data from an understudied case, our findings contribute to the nascent literature on individual preferences for independence. ©

AB  - One of the long-term challenges for policy makers in host countries of migrants is the optimal geographical allocation of the migrant population so as to strengthen integration outcomes and serve the crucial goal of social inclusion. The political debate on the appropriate placement policy of newcomers has continued for years after the large-scale inflows of asylum seekers in Greece. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the dispersal policy of asylum seekers in Greece as implemented under the reception and accommodation scheme. Furthermore, it provides decision makers with an alternative dispersal policy framework driven by the integration outcomes of the already established migrant population in the country. The research encompasses Eurostat NUTS 2 annual data for a choice upon availability of the Zaragoza Integration Indicators and the immigrant population indicator for the thirteen Greek regions. The data cover a ten-year period from 2010 to 2019, and they are analysed with the multiple criteria decision-making method PROMETHEE. In addition to desk research, fieldwork has been conducted to illuminate the results of the model. The paper extends the literature on the governance of migration and contributes to the planning of migrant integration policies in their host countries. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the role of environmental knowledge, perceived consumer effectiveness, and willingness to sacrifice on travelers’ towel reuse behavior. Additionally, it tests whether environmental consciousness moderates the effect of environmental knowledge, perceived consumer effectiveness, willingness to sacrifice, and attitude towards towel reuse on actual towel reuse behavior. The proposed research model was tested using Amazon Mechanical Turk data. Using partial least square structural equation modelling, we analyzed the hypotheses. The results demonstrate that environmental knowledge, perceived consumer effectiveness, and willingness to sacrifice have significant influences on travelers’ towel reuse behavior. Additionally, findings about environmental consciousness indicate that high levels of environmental consciousness can help bridge the attitudebehavior gap. To bridge the gap between travelers’ attitude and behavior, managers should develop communication strategies to raise awareness and a sense of responsibility among them. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The US public's immigration attitudes have become more favourable in recent years, yet the Trump administration (2017-2021) was the most restrictionist on immigration of any modern US presidency. What key sociopolitical factors were associated with holding more exclusionary immigration attitudes and policy preferences among US whites, the ethnoracial group most likely to support Trump, at the beginning of his administration? Analyses of two waves of nationally representative US panel survey data for whites demonstrate that voting for Trump, consuming conservative news, being evangelical, and having a stronger white racial identity were linked with more exclusionary abstract immigration attitudes and/or support for one more Trump-era policies: the US-Mexico wall, the Travel Ban targeting majority-Muslim countries, and deportations of unauthorised immigrants. Together, our results emphasise the value of attending to multiple aspects of the national sociopolitical context, considering diverse potential sources that amplify immigration threat, and jointly examining abstract immigration attitudes and specific policy preferences of varying salience. © 2022 Transnational Press London Ltd.

AB  - The development of anti-racist ideology in adolescence and emerging adulthood is informed by parent socialization, parenting style, and cross-race friendships. This study used longitudinal, multi-reporter survey data from White youth and their parents in Maryland to examine links between parents' racial attitudes when youth were in eleventh grade in 1996 (N = 453; 52% female; Mage = 17.12) and the youths' anti-racist ideology (acknowledgment of anti-Black discrimination and support for affirmative action) 1 year after high school in 1998. This study also examined whether these associations varied based on authoritative parenting and the number of cross-race friendships. Positive parent racial attitudes toward racially and ethnically minoritized populations predicted higher anti-racist ideology in the independent contexts of more cross-race friendships and low authoritative parenting. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives:Socioeconomic inequalities in HIV prevention services coverage constitute important barriers to global prevention targets, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We aimed at monitoring these inequalities from population-based survey data in 18 SSA countries between 2010 and 2018.Methods:We defined eight HIV indicators aimed at capturing uptake of HIV prevention services among adult participants. Country-specific wealth-related inequalities were measured using the Relative and Slope Index of Inequalities (RII and SII, respectively) and then pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. We compared inequalities between African regions using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.Results:The sample consisted of 358 591 participants (66% women). Despite variability between countries and indicators, the meta-analysis revealed significant levels of relative and absolute inequalities in six out of eight indicators: HIV-related knowledge, positive attitudes toward people with HIV (PWH), condom use at last sexual intercourse, participation to prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, medical male circumcision and recent HIV testing. The largest inequalities were reported in condom use, with condom use reported five times more among the richest versus the poorest [RII = 5.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.79-9.05] and in positive attitudes toward PWH, with a 32-percentage point difference between the richest and poorest (SII = 0.32, 95% CI 0.26-0.39). Conversely, no significant inequalities were observed in multipartnership and HIV seropositivity among youth. Overall, inequalities tended to be larger in West and Central vs. East and Southern African countries.Conclusion:Despite efforts to scale-up HIV-prevention programs, socioeconomic inequalities remain substantial over the continuum of HIV primary and secondary prevention in several SSA countries. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: This study demonstrates that voting for the far right has a central affective dimension within the domain of immigration, the effect of which relies on the level of trust one has toward political institutions and equally colors one's estimation of threat. Methods: We use representative data from two studies across three countries (Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) at two time points (2015 and 2019). Results: We first show that anger, rather than fear, constitutes the emotional mechanism underpinning the relationship between anti-immigration attitudes and support for the far right. Second, anger is associated more strongly with far-right voting among those with lower levels of political trust. Third, anger affects how individuals seek out and process information about immigration, resulting in the overestimation of the perceived threat. Conclusion: These findings shed light on a key puzzle of electoral behavior: Why do some citizens with anti-immigrant attitudes opt for radical politics, whereas others do not. © 2022 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - As is known, sustainability issues represent one of the main challenges companies have to face. Among all, the fashion industry is considered one of the most impactful, both in terms of resource utilization and pollution. Fashion renting is a recent business model for companies to reduce their environmental footprint, following a circular economy approach. The study aims to develop and discuss the proposed hybrid approach to effectively support fashion companies in designing new business models, taking into account both the customer and the company perspective. On the one hand, agent-based modeling (ABM) allow us to represent customers’ behaviour and interaction. On the other hand, discrete event simulation (DES) paradigm is used to model fashion renting processes. Because customers’ attitude to that service reflects its successful implementation, motivators and barriers have been investigated to be included in the model. The practical implication is defining a model to support fashion companies in designing rental business models before implementing them. From a theoretical point of view, it overcomes the literature gap about the definition of a unique model for fashion renting, including processes, customers and interactions between agents. Follow-up research will include the presentation of simulation results. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This experimental study examined the effects of biological attributions on individuals’ beliefs and attitudes toward transgender people and the moderating role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). We randomly assigned 183 Chinese university students (men: n = 85, women: n = 98) to read one of three fictitious articles. The first article suggested that transgender identity was causally linked to biology (biological determinist condition), the second one highlighted the interplay between biological and environmental factors (epigenetic condition), whereas the third article did not mention the origins of transgender identity (control condition). Consistent with the biased assimilation hypothesis, the effects of biological attributions depended on individual differences in RWA. Low-RWA participants showed higher levels of naturalness and discreteness/homogeneity beliefs about transgender identity in the biological determinist condition than those in the control condition. By contrast, high-RWA participants displayed higher levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs but similar levels of naturalness beliefs when they read the biological determinist message compared with the control group. Low-RWA participants showed higher levels of naturalness but similar levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs in the epigenetic condition compared with the control, whereas high-RWA participants exhibited lower levels of naturalness and higher levels of discreteness/homogeneity beliefs when they read the epigenetic message compared with the control group. This study also suggests that, contrary to attribution theory, presenting information regarding the biological basis of transgender identity does not necessarily lead to more positive attitudes because (a) it triggers essentialist thinking and (b) the effects of biological attributions depend on recipients’ authoritarian dispositions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Previous studies found that individuals who harbor hostile attitudes toward immigrants & refugees tend to vote for far right nationalist parties, and that the same individuals also tend to report worse health status. We sought to test these associations using the latest data from 21 EU countries, and also whether the associations were moderated by the share of unemployed people in each region and individuals’ labor situation. Methods: We analyzed the second release of the 2016 European Social Survey which includes different questions about attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, as well as a rich variety of socioeconomic variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were developed, regressing fair/poor health on attitudes towards immigrants & refugees. Results: For each one point increase in favorable attitudes toward immigrants, the prevalence of fair/poor health was reduced by 2 percentage points (PR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96–0.99). In analyses incorporating cross-level interactions, the association was not moderated by high background unemployment rates or individual labor market attachment. Conclusion: Positive attitudes toward immigrants are correlated with lower prevalence of fair/poor health in general, regardless of individuals’ labor situation and the objective economic situation. Fostering empathy toward immigrants and refugees may thus promote a healthier society, especially among more prejudiced individuals. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents’ attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N = 498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N = 1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As the demand for resources has increased with the high population growth rate, people have been tempted to encroach on wildlife areas for activities such as logging, animal husbandry, agriculture, and developmental projects. This has led to the spread of human-inhabited areas into wildlife habitats and resulting conflict between humans and wildlife. Human–monkey conflict (HMC) is a developing issue in Sri Lanka, negatively impacting both nonhuman primate conservation and human welfare. To address and mitigate HMC, it is essential to assess community-level awareness about nonhuman primates in order to mitigate such conflict. The aim of this study was to evaluate awareness and public perception towards diurnal monkeys in Polonnaruwa district in North Central Sri Lanka. A structured questionnaire survey (N = 200) was carried out from December 2018 to November 2019. Respondents’ knowledge about monkeys was found to depend on gender and occupation. Respondents’ attitudes towards monkeys were dependent on gender, ethnic group, religion, state of education, and monthly household income. Those who had experienced many disturbances from monkeys held more negative attitudes towards monkeys than others. A nonlethal multidisciplinary approach is critical to reducing the increasing HMC in Polonnaruwa district. Similar approaches can be operated in other areas where human–wildlife conflict is causing strain on wildlife conservation and human welfare. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Japan Monkey Centre.

AB  - Given the salience and rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States, Mexican immigrants who are not integrated into the American cultural system, are undocumented, or are men may be particularly susceptible to negative treatment. Moreover, people who are high in social dominance orientation (SDO) endorse social hierarchies and are more likely to perceive groups from a lower status less positively. Using a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design, we presented participants (N = 243) with a vignette describing a Mexican immigrant who differed on acculturation strategy (assimilated or separated), documentation status (documented or undocumented), and gender (woman or man). We then asked participants to answer questions about the Mexican immigrant and complete an SDO scale. Overall, participants had more negative perceptions of separated (vs. assimilated) and undocumented (vs. documented) Mexican immigrants, and they felt less positively about Mexican immigrant women (vs. men). Participants with high SDO felt more negatively about separated (vs. assimilated) Mexican immigrants. Additionally, participants perceived the separated (vs. assimilated) Mexican immigrant as being more representative of Mexican immigrants as a group, but they identified more with the assimilated (vs. separated) Mexican immigrant. We also assessed participants’ attitudes toward Mexican immigrants in general and found that they perceived greater competitiveness toward undocumented (vs. documented) Mexican immigrants. These findings provide important insight into factors that impact U.S. perceptions of Mexican immigrants—a starting point to better understand and improve relations between the U.S. public and Mexican immigrants. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Pervasive surveillance in modern society has raised mounting debates, which are largely concentrated on the ethical dimension and lack sociological examination. Drawing on innovative national survey data, this study analyzes public opinion about social credit systems, an emerging infrastructure that expands the depth and breadth of surveillance in China. I find a general high support for expanding surveillance and punishment yet key variations among different social groups. Counterintuitively, people with higher political capital do not wholly embrace the expanding surveillance and punishment. For example, Chinese Communist Party members are less likely to support state-centered social credit systems compared with the general public. Higher political trust in the regime and socioeconomic status is consistently correlated with higher support, while different media consumption showed limited correlations. This study proposes an alternative theorization of surveillance and enriches our understanding of the heterogeneity and dynamic of the state and public in the authoritarian regime. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Across group-living taxa, males act aggressively towards outgroup males because they represent a threat to reproduction with ingroup females. This intergroup aggression can entail agonistic coalition formation between group members, is typically associated with higher testosterone levels and prevents extended associations between members of different groups. However, in a few species, including humans, groups can interact peacefully, allowing the exchange of resources and information. To better understand how social relationships are manifested between groups and the involvement of males in these relationships, we investigated behavioural and endocrine correlates of male strategies during intergroup encounters in bonobos, Pan paniscus. We found that, despite overt intergroup aggression, males rarely engaged in coalitionary attacks against outgroup individuals and their testosterone levels did not rise during intergroup encounters. Also, males sacrificed the time available to affiliate with ingroup individuals and actively affiliated with outgroup individuals, especially outgroup males. The paucity of cooperative group defence and high levels of intergroup affiliation suggest that male bonobos play a role in maintaining tolerant intergroup relationships. We discuss how our findings relate to the establishment of male–male social relationships beyond the group level in other species. © 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour

AB  - Objectives: Vaccination for COVID-19 is an effective method of preventing complications; however, studies suggest that public attitudes toward the vaccine are heterogeneous. The objective of our study was to identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January 2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models and controlled for respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants. Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.02-3.79). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy and concerns may exacerbate existing COVID-19 health disparities in racial and ethnic groups and highlight the need to target messaging to specific populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, because these populations are at high risk for COVID-19 complications. © 2022, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

AB  - Even when people hold little prejudice themselves, expectations about how members of other groups perceive them may negatively influence interracial relations. In four pre-registered experiments, each using a full intergroup design with Black and White participants, we show that people infer negative meta-attitudes from out-group members whose appearance is phenotypically prototypical, which in turn leads to less favorable orientations toward intergroup contact, independent of personal attitudes. In Experiment 1, Black Americans, but not White Americans, perceived that more phenotypically prototypical out-group members held less favorable meta-attitudes, and this explained less favorable contact orientations. In Experiment 2, this pattern emerged for both groups of participants and was particularly pronounced among individuals higher in stigma consciousness. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 with representative samples and demonstrated that the effect of phenotypic prototypicality was more pronounced among participants reporting greater previous rejection by the out-group. With few exceptions, participants in the experiments also perceived phenotypically prototypical in-group members as having less positive meta-attitudes and participants showed less favorable contact orientations toward these in-group targets. An internal meta-analysis supported the robustness of the findings in the first three experiments. In Experiment 4, direct evidence for the causal effect of the mediator meta-attitudes on orientations toward contact with in- and out-group members was obtained. In all studies, effects held controlling for participants' general intergroup attitudes and experiences, demonstrating the unique role of meta-attitudes in shaping intergroup relations. We discuss our results in light of previous research, highlight social implications, and suggest future directions. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The presidency of Donald Trump represented a relatively unique event in modern American history, whereby a sitting US president made numerous controversial remarks about minoritized groups yet nonetheless maintained substantial public support. Trump’s comments constituted a departure from the egalitarian norms that had long characterized American political discourse. Here, we examine the potential effects of Trump’s rhetoric on Americans’ attitudes, predicting that these high-profile norm violations may have reshaped the personal prejudices of the American people. In 13 studies including over 10,000 participants, we tested how Americans’ prejudice changed following the political ascension of Donald Trump. We found that explicit racial and religious prejudice significantly increased amongst Trump’s supporters, whereas individuals opposed to Trump exhibited decreases in prejudice. Further, changing social norms appear to explain these changes in prejudice. These results suggest that Trump’s presidency coincided with a substantial change in the topography of prejudice in the United States. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Political responsiveness is highly unequal along class lines, which has triggered a lively debate about potential causes of this political inequality. What has remained largely unexplored in this debate are the structural economic conditions under which policymakers operate. In this contribution, we hypothesize that budgetary pressures affect both the level and the equality of political responsiveness. Using a dataset containing public opinion data on around 450 fiscal policy proposals in Germany between 1980 and 2016, we investigate whether policymakers are more responsive on issues with budgetary consequences under conditions of low fiscal pressure than under conditions of high fiscal pressure. We find that responsiveness indeed varies systematically with the degree of fiscal pressure and that policymakers are less responsive on fiscal issues when fiscal pressure is high. This holds for both left-wing and right-wing governments. In contrast, we do not find strong effects of fiscal pressure on political inequality: responsiveness is not more equal in fiscally more permissive times. However, since different types of policy proposals are adopted in times of high fiscal stress, unequal responsiveness has different policy implications in times of high and low fiscal pressure. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Is labour market vulnerability associated with harsher preferences on asylum-seeking policy? If so, how might the size of the existing foreign-born population condition this effect? We unpack these dynamics across 20 European countries using 2014 ESS and EU-SILC data. In doing so, we examine the relevance of labour market vulnerability both directly and in combination with: individual-level exposure to people of a different race or ethnicity; and the perceived or actual size of the foreign-born population. Results suggest that exposure to labour market risk is associated with a preference for harsher treatment, but that this relationship is driven by respondents with little to no interactions with the existing minority population. We also find that labour market vulnerability is associated with higher (lower) preferred severity in countries with a large (small) presumed foreign-born population. The actual size of the foreign-born population, by contrast, does not appear to matter. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Movement synchrony is an essential feature of rituals and collective displays around the world. Previous studies have shown that synchronous movements increase observers’ perceived group entitativity and fighting capacity in agonistic contexts; however, little is known about the developmental roots of synchrony-dominant attributions. In this study, adult participants (Exp 1), 5- to 6-year-old children (Exp 2) and 7- to 8-year-old children (Exp 3) predicted outcomes of zero-sum conflicts between two groups of animated agents after each group exhibited either synchronised or non-synchronised movements. Predictions were made for conflicts between two individual members from different groups (individual-conflict condition) and between all members of the two groups (group-conflict condition). Results showed that none of the participant groups showed a synchrony-dominant preference in the individual-conflict condition. In the group-conflict condition, most adult participants expected the groups exhibiting synchronised movements to be socially dominant. Although 5- to 6-year-old children did not show more biased expectations than can be accounted for by chance, adult-like synchrony-dominant preference was found in 7- to 8-year-old children. Moreover, justifications of the synchrony-dominant expectation in both adults and 7- to 8-year-old children showed that this expectation was driven by the perceived entitativity of the synchronous group. These findings show that the expectation of group dominance based on synchronous movements is strongly developed in school-age children, explaining the developmental origins of intergroup attitudes as well as the cognitive mechanisms children employ when making judgments in intergroup contexts. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Immigration has historically been of low salience in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East's limited politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of emigration and the presence of ethnic minority ‘others’. I argue that this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly related to anti-immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are polarizing across the GAL-TAN dimension and by education. Hence, immigration is bolstering a pre-existing, socially structured divide around both nationalist and traditionalist values. © 2021 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) is a widely researched construct that indexes a preference for hierarchical intergroup relations. However, it remains unclear whether this preference (a) motivates people to seek out occupations that enhance hierarchical relations between groups (i.e., occupational assortment), (b) develops as a result of working within hierarchy-enhancing occupations (i.e., occupational socialization), or (c) both. One reason for this gap is that the large-scale longitudinal data required to simultaneously model assortment and socialization processes are scarce. In this study, we analyzed data from two waves of longitudinal data (spaced either 1, 3, or 5 years apart) from a nationwide sample of adults (N = 3,452–4,412) who were already working in either hierarchy-enhancing occupations (e.g., law enforcement) or hierarchy-attenuating occupations (e.g., social work). Results showed that SDO predicted an increased probability of working in a hierarchy-enhancing occupation 3 and 5 years later. Working in a hierarchy-enhancing occupation was also positively associated with SDO after 1 and 5 years. These patterns generally suggest that occupations both shape, and are shaped by, intergroup beliefs. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion regarding the COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during the COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors—age, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic level—on sources of information. Subject and methods: An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less. Conclusion: In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors. Researchers and policymakers can use a source of information to develop crisis-response strategies by considering variations in the demographic factors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study investigates the driving forces of public endorsement of two major intergovernmental organizations—the UN and NATO. More specifically, I scrutinize the effects of two sets of independent variables on individual support for security intergovernmental organizations: respondents’ subjective evaluation of the domestic economic conditions and the gap between the home country’s foreign policy preferences and the mean preference within the said intergovernmental organization. For the empirical analysis, I employ cross-sectional survey data acquired from Pew Global Attitudes Surveys covering a sample of 37 countries and 10 waves spanning 2007–2017. The statistical analyses lend strong support for both hypotheses. Specifically, citizens who are dissatisfied with the national economic conditions are less likely to be in favor of intergovernmental organizations. The negative correlation between the perceptions of domestic economic performance and attitudes toward intergovernmental organizations is particularly compelling in countries that contribute more to the budget of that intergovernmental organization. Second, in countries where the foreign policy preferences converge with the other members of an intergovernmental organization, public opinion is more favorably disposed toward that intergovernmental organization. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Marine protected areas are a common conservation management tool to protect marine ecosystems around the world. It has been found that while technical considerations regarding location and size are important for assessing a marine protected area's effectiveness, the attitudes that communities hold towards marine protected areas can be equally important. Using seven years of public surveys in South Australia from 2012 to 2019, this study explores what potential differences exist across space and time in community attitudes towards marine parks. Overall, probit regression modelling results indicate that opposition to marine parks in South Australia has fallen over time, and that opposition was highest in regional areas. In addition, familiarity with marine parks and associating parks in general with conservation protection influenced people's positive attitudes towards marine parks. Sociodemographic characteristics of gender, age and education were also important. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Most research on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration problematically conflates the documented and the undocumented. Previous studies also largely ignore the autonomous role of population density. Based on data drawn from two nationally representative surveys, this paper focuses on contemporary American attitudes towards undocumented immigration and immigrants. Contra the dominant view, we find that education and income have no effect. More important, population density, measured at the county level, significantly predicts favorable attitudes, controlling for factors often erroneously conflated with density: race, income, education, political affiliation, age, gender, and interaction with immigrants. In fact, interaction tends to decrease favorable attitudes. We explain these findings by proposing a novel account of cosmopolitanism, using favorable attitudes towards undocumented immigrants and immigration as an empirical indicator. Those who live in places with higher density are more used to see and be seen in everyday life by countless people with whom they share the same spaces without necessarily interacting with them. As a result, they are more likely to consider all them, including undocumented immigrants, in a superficial yet egalitarian way as generalized others to be ignored. It is this tolerance based on general indifference that is the basis of cosmopolitanism. ©

AB  - Does exposure to cyber terrorism prompt calls for retaliatory military strikes? By what psychological mechanism does it do so? Through a series of controlled, randomized experiments, this study exposed respondents (n = 2,028) to television news reports depicting cyber and conventional terror attacks against critical infrastructures in the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. The findings indicate that only lethal cyber terrorism triggers strong support for retaliation. Findings also confirm that anger bridges exposure to cyber terrorism and retaliation, rather than psychological mechanisms such as threat perception or anxiety as other studies propose. These findings extend to the cyber realm a recent trend that views anger as a primary mechanism linking exposure to terrorism with militant preferences. With cyber terrorism a mounting international concern, this study demonstrates how exposure to this threat can generate strong public support for retaliatory policies, depending on the lethality of the attack.

AB  - Objectives To describe public attitudes and knowledge around antibiotic activity, resistance and use. Design Face-to-face household 18 question survey using computer-assisted data collection undertaken by Ipsos Market and Opinion Research International. Setting Randomly selected households across England, January-February 2020. Participants 2022 adults (aged 15+,) including 521 black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) participants, and 406 aged 15-25 years olds. Main outcome measures Responses to questions about antibiotic activity, resistance and expectations for antibiotics and trust in healthcare professionals. Analyses were weighted to obtain estimates representative of the population with multivariable analysis undertaken for questions with five or more significant univariate variables. Results 84% stated they would be pleased if their general practitioner (GP) said they did not need antibiotics. Trust in GPs to make antibiotic decisions remains high (89%) and has increased for nurses (76%) and pharmacists (71%). Only 21% would challenge an antibiotic decision; this was significantly greater in BAME participants (OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.89 to 3.35). 70% reported receiving advice when prescribed antibiotics. Belief in benefits of antibiotics for ear infections was very high (68%). Similar to 2017, 81% agreed that antibiotics work for bacterial, 28% cold and influenza viruses. 84% agreed antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) are increasing, only 50% agreed healthy people can carry ARB and 39% agreed there was nothing they personally could do about ARB. Social grade DE and BAME participants, and those with less education had significantly less understanding about antibiotics and resistance. Conclusions As trust in healthcare practitioners is high, we need to continue antibiotic education and other interventions at GP surgeries and community pharmacies but highlight that most ear infections are not benefitted by antibiotics. Targeted interventions are needed for socioeconomic DE, BAME groups and previous antibiotic users. We need to explore if increasing perceived personal responsibility for preventing ARB reduces antibiotic use. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The increasing incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to cause morbidities, mortalities, and economic crises worldwide. College students are among the high-risk groups to acquire the disease for many reasons. Thus, the COVID-19 vaccine is the most effective and safe method to control this deadly disease. Although World Health Organization advocates vaccination is the best approach to tackle COVID-19, refusal of vaccination is a global problem. Evidence of reaching out to college students is scarce in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Therefore, this study aimed to assess willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and associated factors among college students in northwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 626 participants from January 12–26, 2021. Data were collected using a pretested, self-administered questionnaire, and a multistage sampling technique was used. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7.1.5.2 and exported into SPSS version 20 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify associated factors. The level of significance was determined based on a p-value < 0.05. Results: In this study, the student’s willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine was 34.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 30.9–38.1]. Being third-year student [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.88; 95% CI: 1.27–2.77], being male (AOR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.02–2.09), being married (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.28–3.33), ever watching TV (AOR = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.24–0.65), and having a positive attitude toward COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.61–3.39) were the factors significantly associated with the willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: Willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine among college students was low. Sensitization of students about COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness before directly giving the vaccine is recommended. Moreover, concerned bodies should provide improved health education to students to bring a favorable attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - This study was a mixed-method quantitative and qualitative analysis that analyzed content posted to TheDonald.win, a web forum popular with extreme supporters of Donald Trump. The purpose of this study was to expand knowledge of the dynamics of radicalized online spaces, especially the role that shifting In-Group and Out-Group membership plays in fomenting increased levels of observably radicalized language. The study examined the top-20 posts on the website every day between when the 2020 US presidential election was called and the presidential inauguration in January 2021. The study found that In-Group membership was maintained only by expressing open, public support of Trump’s claims of election fraud, that misinformation was rampant on the site but was often vague in its linguistic form, and that posters to TheDonald.win saw their own In-Group as the victims of violence more often than they used violent rhetoric against members of the Out-Group. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Students majoring in non-STEM fields often identify introductory biology courses as irrelevant and overly rigorous. Resistance to enroll in a required general education science course, coupled with negative attitudes toward the subject, can adversely affect the academic performance of students; this can especially be present in students from under-represented minority groups. Therefore, instructors have to intentionally design a curriculum that overcomes these factors as they educate non-major students enrolled in introductory biology. BioArt, a learning community, was formed between introductory biology and introduction to graphic design courses to improve the attitudes and academic performance of students in the biology course at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU). The BioArt model incorporated a common theme, project- based learning, and opportunities for experiential learning. To measure outcomes, traditional examinations, non-traditional assessments, failure/withdraw rates, and student attitudes were evaluated. Using this model, introductory biology became less intimidating, more relevant, and improved academic success among freshman minority students. Thus, the BioArt model can be utilized as an intervention at different institutions of higher learning. © 2022 American Society for Microbiology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background The issue of whether to include seasonal influenza vaccinations in school-located vaccination programs (SLIV) has been examined in many countries, mainly in the context of economic effectiveness and morbidity prevention. Yet not enough studies have examined the impact of parental risk perceptions, health literacy and SLIV on parental vaccination uptake. Objectives The most recent statistics in Israel point to a higher rate of seasonal influenza vaccination among Arab children (aged 7-9 years) than among Jewish children in the same age group. The present study attempts to explain this high vaccination uptake among mothers from Arab society by comparing their risk perceptions regarding seasonal influenza vaccination and disease to those of Jewish mothers. The study further examines the impact of SLIV on parental risk perceptions and influenza vaccination uptake. Methods This cross-sectional study included mothers of children in the second and third grades faced with the decision of whether their children should receive the seasonal influenza vaccination at school. The study population included a stratified sample of Jewish mothers (n = 159) and Arab mothers from all the Arab population sub-groups: Muslim, Christian, Druse and Bedouin (n = 534). Results A comparison of the Arab and Jewish populations revealed a significant difference in vaccination rates; 61.7% among Arab mothers compared to 33.5% among Jewish mothers (x2(1) = 39.15, P<0.0001). Moreover, significant differences emerged between the Arab and Jewish populations in health literacy and ability to seek information regarding the seasonal influenza vaccination (t (691) = -5.81, p < 0.0001). While no differences emerged in mothers' perceptions regarding influenza as a disease (t (691) = 1.20, p = 0.2318), Arab mothers perceived the vaccination to be safer than Jewish mothers (t (691) = 2.74, p = 0.0063) and saw its inclusion in the school-located vaccination program as providing more legitimacy (Z = -6.6719, P < .0001). Conclusion This study showed that the factors influencing vaccination uptake among both the Arab and the Jewish populations include perceived influenza risk, perceived vaccination risk, inclusion in the school-located vaccination program and health literacy. Moreover, influenza vaccination uptake is higher among those who have positive attitudes toward vaccinations, low risk perceptions regarding the vaccine, and low health literacy that impedes their ability to seek information. The research also points to the need for education and tools to boost health literacy among minority groups so that mothers can make independent and informed decisions about whether or not to vaccinate their children. © 2022 Abed Elhadi Shahbari et al.

AB  - The influx of refugees to Europe is a topic that dominates the political and media agenda. Furthermore, the installation of asylum-seeker centres (ASCs) has made asylum seekers and refugees highly visible in the everyday life of many European citizens. Drawing on theories of ethnic threat and intergroup contact, we examine how geospatial proximity to ASCs translates into threat or contact in an everyday context and how this affects attitudes toward asylum seekers. By taking advantage of a natural experiment, where the ASCs are assigned to city districts as-if at random, as well as innovating measures of outgroup exposure and geospatial proximity, we find that, although higher numbers of asylum seekers in one's own neighbourhood are related to an increased perception of their local presence, the actual presence of asylum seekers does not lead to more negative attitudes or a greater threat perception, nor to more frequent contact. It is only when the number of asylum seekers in one's own direct neighbourhood suddenly increases that attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorate. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Food businesses, such as food trucks (FTs) and family producers have grown rapidly and become popular with people in Saudi Arabia. As foodborne diseases are still a public health concern in the country, consumers should be aware of the safety of foods sold by food trucks. Since there is a dearth of literature, this study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of consumers of food from FTs owned by family producers regarding food safety and foodborne disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 921 consumers of food from FTs from two cities in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from September to November 2021. Finally, multiple linear regression and a logistic regression model were used to identify the predictors of knowledge and attitude regarding food safety and foodborne illness, respectively. Overall, respondents had moderate knowledge and higher positive attitudes regarding food safety and foodborne illness. Respondents’ knowledge about the potential harm and attitudes towards the safety of foods sold by FTs were significantly associated with marital status, education level, and monthly family income. The findings of this study highlight the need to improve the knowledge, awareness, and attitudes of Saudi consumers of food from FTs owned by family producers on food safety and foodborne illness through intervention programs, particularly targeting consumers with lower educational attainments and income status, to control foodborne diseases. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Racial disparities in policing are well documented, but the reasons for such disparities are often debated. In the current research, we weighed in on this debate using a regional-level bias framework: We investigated the link between racial disparities in police traffic stops and regional-level racial bias, employing data from more than 130 million police traffic stops in 1,413 U.S. counties and county-level measures of racial bias from more than 2 million online respondents. Compared with their population share in county demographics, Black drivers were stopped at disproportionate rates in the majority of counties. Crucially, disproportionate stopping of Black drivers was higher in counties with higher levels of racial prejudice by White residents (rs =.07−.36). Furthermore, county-level aggregates of White people’s threat-related stereotypes were less consistent in predicting disproportionate stopping (rs =.00−.19). These observed relationships between regional-level bias and racial disparities in policing highlight the importance of the context in which police operate. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Disparities in the treatment of Black and White Americans in police stops are pernicious and widespread. We examined racial disparities in police traffic stops by leveraging data on hundreds of U.S. counties from the Stanford Open Policing Project and corresponding county-level data on implicit and explicit racial attitudes from the Project Implicit research website. We found that Black–White traffic-stop disparities are associated with county-level implicit and explicit racial attitudes and that this association is attributable to racial demographics: Counties with a higher proportion of White residents had larger racial disparities in police traffic stops. We also examined racial disparities in several poststop outcomes (e.g., arrest rates) and found that they were not systematically related to racial attitudes, despite evidence of disparities. These findings indicate that racial disparities in counties’ traffic stops are reliably linked to counties’ racial attitudes and demographic compositions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - To determine whether children will exclude or punish a peer who creates an unfair advantage in an intergroup team context, four- to ten-year-old participants (N = 120, Mage = 6.87) were assigned a team membership and evaluated unintentional and intentional unfair advantages created by a character. Children were more likely to endorse punishment and exclusion responses when reasoning about an opponent than a teammate. This difference between groups was not observed when in-group and out-group members reasoned about punishing a character who intentionally created an unfair advantage. Older children were less likely to endorse exclusion than younger participants. Further, older children and in-group members utilized punishment more frequently than exclusion. Taken together this demonstrates that the group identity and the age of the child influences the ways in which children endorse responses to transgressions. These findings increase our understanding regarding children's conceptions of fairness responses to transgressions in intergroup contexts. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Two studies explored the intersection between the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing fight for racial justice. The pandemic has exacerbated existing racial inequalities in the United States in terms of public health and economic outcomes, and it is well-established that individuals higher in racial bias are less likely to support social safety net programs such as those meant to improve public health and reduce poverty. This is particularly true among individuals who perceive racial minorities as overbenefitting from safety net programs. Accordingly, the primary focus of the current studies was to examine whether framing the pandemic in terms of its disproportionate impact on minorities would reduce support for pandemic mitigation policies. In addition, we examine whether such effects were mediated through psychological mechanisms of moral outrage and perceptions of realistic and symbolic threat, and moderated by participants’ racial bias. Participants’ belief in a just world was included as a covariate given its established role in predicting many related social outcomes. Results suggested that racial framing interacts with participants’ racial bias to affect policy support indirectly through multiple mechanisms. Broad implications regarding the relationship between racial bias and public support for a strong social safety net are discussed. © 2022 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.

AB  - This study contributes with minority-centred perspectives to the policy trend of imposing majority language requirements on immigrants. With the aim to identify and explore (dis)connections and value conflicts between policies of national minority recognition and immigrant integration, it develops and applies four ideal types of minority-linguistic integration regimes to a mapping of integration and minority language policies in 27 European Union (EU) member states. Most states with recognized minorities are found to exclude national minorities from integration policies. The finding is connected to a discussion that identifies normative tensions between the promotion of national minority languages, the linguistic barriers faced by non-citizen migrants and the asymmetries in how identity and instrumental values are assigned to minority, migrant and majority languages. The study challenges the imposition of language requirements on immigrants and calls for contextually sensitive ways to jointly consider the position of national minorities, majorities, and immigrants in language policies. © 2022 The Author.

AB  - A prevailing theme in White nationalist rhetoric is nostalgia for a time when Whites dominated American culture and had unchallenged status. The present research examines a form of collective nostalgia called racial nostalgia and its association with negative intergroup attitudes and extreme ideologies (White nationalism). In Studies 1 and 2, racial nostalgia was associated with higher racial identity, anti-immigrant attitudes, and White nationalism. Study 2 revealed that racial nostalgia was related to extreme ideologies, in part, through perceptions that immigrants and racial minorities posed realistic/symbolic threats. Study 3 manipulated nostalgia using a writing prompt (“America’s racial past” vs. “games of America’s past”) and an identity prime (prime vs. no prime). Racial nostalgia was higher in the racial prompt versus the games prompt condition, regardless of identity prime. Furthermore, there were significant indirect effects of the nostalgia manipulation on support for anti-immigrant policies and endorsement of White nationalism through increased racial nostalgia and its association with perceived threats. These findings show that racial nostalgia can be a maladaptive form of collective nostalgia linked to a sense of loss and threat, and can make people sympathetic to extreme racial ideologies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study uses the theory of planned behavior as a framework to predict intentions of noncompliance with social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic while also assessing the predictive role of intolerance of uncertainty and sociodemographic variables. A total of 2,056 Brazilian participants completed measures on attitudes, injunctive, and descriptive norms, and perceived behavioral control toward social distancing. They also answered about their political ideology, income, employment status, gender, age, and educational level. Our findings indicate that positive attitudes toward complying with physical distancing, stronger descriptive norms using ingroup members as referents, and weaker perceived behavioral control over the action of breaching social distancing predict stronger adherence. Besides, individuals who support right-wing parties, younger people, and males are more prone to noncompliance. We suggest designing interventions that foster positive attitudes toward social distancing and address the negative consequences that violating social distancing can cause to in-group members to persuade individuals to stay at home. We also discuss the need for support from prominent political figures to increase adherence to this preventive measure. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccine uptake is an urgent public health priority. Purpose: To identify psychosocial determinants (attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control) of COVID-19 vaccination intentions for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic adults, and how COVID-19 misperceptions, beliefs about the value of science, and perceived media bias relate to these determinants. Methods: Longitudinal online survey using two national samples (18-49 years old/50 years and older), each stratified by racial/ethnic group (n = 3,190). Data were collected in October/November 2020 and were weighted by race group to be representative. Results: Path analyses showed that more positive attitudes about getting vaccinated predict intention across age and racial/ethnic groups, but normative pressure is relevant among older adults only. Belief in the value of science was positively associated with most determinants across all groups, however the association of COVID-19 misperceptions and perceived media bias with the determinants varied by age group. Conclusions: Messages that emphasize attitudes toward vaccination can be targeted to all age and racial/ethnic groups, and positive attitudes are universally related to a belief in the value of science. The varying role of normative pressure poses messages design challenges to increase vaccination acceptance. © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - An emerging body of research finds that exposure to the shifting racial demographics of a nation can engender concerns about racial group status among members of the dominant racial group. The present work revisits this finding, probing a broader set of group status concerns than has been examined in most past research. Three experiments exposed four samples of White Americans to racial demographic information or race-neutral control information, then assessed their perception that the relative status of racial groups in the nation would change and the extent to which they were alarmed by such a status shift—that is, status threat. Consistent with past work, what we now term perceived status change increased in response to salient racial demographics information, relative to race-neutral control information, irrespective of participants’ political ideology. Departing from past work, however, the perceived threat associated with changing racial demographics was moderated by political ideology. Specifically, politically conservative White participants demonstrated high levels of group status threat in the neutral control condition that either increased (Study 1a, Study 2) or stayed equally high (Study 1b, Study 3) after exposure to information about a racial shift. In contrast, in all studies, politically liberal White participants demonstrated a modest level of group status threat in the control condition that was attenuated upon exposure to a racial shift. Taken together, these results suggest a polarization of responses to the increasing racial diversity of the nation, one that was not observed even just a few years ago. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Two studies examined whether men’s perception of the declining value of traditional masculinity activates social status, realistic, and symbolic threat, and in turn motivates opposition to feminist social movements. In Study 1, men’s perception that their ingroup is losing value across several social spheres was associated with social status and realistic threat, both of which were associated with opposition to feminist movements. Study 2, an experiment, presented men with public opinion data showing a 30-year decline in the degree to which Americans value traditional masculinity or no decline. Information about the declining value of masculinity activated status threat, which motivated less support for feminist movements. Among men who highly identified as masculine, this same information reduced support for feminist movements through symbolic threat. In sum, perceived decline in the social value of traditional masculinity creates status anxiety about the ingroup’s future and motivates compensatory reactions against gender equality. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - It is often assumed that, in Western societies, Christian values are embedded in national identities, yet, the association between religious identities and prejudice has seldom been studied in parallel to national identity. According to both the social identity theory approach and integrated threat theory, group identification is important for perceiving threats and expressing corresponding attitudes. Nevertheless, their independent roles on intergroup outcomes have often been ignored, although they are two of the most salient and important identities when considering support for religious minority rights. We address this gap in research by looking at the associations of religious identity with support for religious minority rights in general and Muslims in particular in parallel to national identity through diversity threat. This study was conducted among the members of majority groups in four Western countries: Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway (N = 1,532), all of which are characterised as traditionally Christian. We found that a higher religious identification was associated with greater support for religious minority rights in general and for those of Muslims in particular, while national identification had no direct association with support for either groups’ religious rights. However, both group identifications were also associated with heightened perceived diversity threat, which in turn, predicted reluctance to support religious minority rights. This demonstrates the dual role that religious identities may play in intergroup relations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Immigration has been a prominent political issue for decades, but particularly so with rising national populism. To understand current anti-immigration opinion, we turn to the concept of relative deprivation, which, we argue, is fundamentally about entitlement and is at the heart of popular backlash against immigration. Examining the United Kingdom context, we predicted that immigration attitudes would be contingent on immigrant group status, with immigrants from low-status or poorer countries (Poland, India) more likely to be perceived as encroaching on the majority group’s entitlements than those from high-status or richer countries (Germany, Australia). We further proposed moral devaluation (dehumanization and distrust) as a novel mechanism (over and above prejudice) underlying the conditional effects of relative deprivation on support for formal (anti-immigration policies) and informal (hate crime) means of immigrant exclusion. A pilot study (n = 245) and cross-sectional survey (n = 490) results supported our main prediction that status matters: participants felt more deprived relative to low- than high-status immigrants, and this predicted stronger support for anti-immigration policies both directly and through higher distrust (but not dehumanization). This research highlights the need to unpack the generic ‘immigrant’ category and study anti-immigration sentiment in terms of group status and moral devaluation. © 2021 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Objectives: In Switzerland, in spite of a positive attitude towards organ donation, the population seems to overlook the public health messages about it. Based on a qualitative study on campaigns about organ donation, the article aims to give practical suggestions to prevent undesirable effects in public health communication. Methods: The study provides a linguistic analysis of the messages about organ donation produced by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. Such a method enables us to understand who communicates what, to whom, how and what for, and gives us empirical data to discuss ethical concerns in relation to the effects of public health messages. Results: The analysis shows that the messages, apart from those relying on the expertise of healthcare professionals, are based on the representation of lay persons. The latter strategy generates the depiction of imagined communities. Conclusions: Beyond the usual concerns relating to organ donation (e.g., consent, altruism), the analysis of FOPH messages indicates that ethical issues in public health communication are grounded on three relational dimensions (intersubjectivity, cooperation and equity). Practice implications: A procedure assessing the ethical concerns of public health communication in terms of social identities and relational consequences could identify and prevent problems relating to the undesirable effects of messages.

AB  - The racial demographic shift occurring in many Western countries provides a unique context to study the reactions of a high-power group (White people) to the potential loss of their privileged position in society. Three experiments (N = 77, N = 302, N = 555) conducted in Canada, the US, and the UK showed that White people who are reminded about the ongoing demographic changes and who see race relations as a zero-sum game whereby any gains by minorities must come at the expense of the majority, experience stronger collective angst and, to a lesser extent, fear (but not anger). In turn, collective angst, but not the other negative group-based emotions, fuels their motivation to protect the existing intergroup hierarchy by withdrawing support for progressive social movements and increases anti-immigration sentiments. Downregulating the existential threat experienced by White majorities in the face of a racial demographic shift may be one way to reduce acrimonious behavioral intentions aimed at preserving their place in the social hierarchy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Mobilizing public support is key to a movement's success. Little is known, however, about how movements can achieve this goal and whether involving advantaged group members is beneficial for a movement's cause. In a set of five experiments with convenience samples collected in the United States and Germany (total N = 1,625), we examined whether protests (e.g., against racism and sexism) with and without advantaged group members affect politicized identification among observers. We expected that the presence (vs. absence) of advantaged group members at a protest will increase politicized identification among advantaged group observers, which was confirmed in Studies 1A–1C. In contrast, we expected that the disadvantaged group observers will increase or decrease their politicized identification depending on the role advantaged group members have at a protest (i.e., supportive vs. leadership role). Studies 2A–2B revealed that when advantaged group members had a supportive role, disadvantaged and advantaged group observers increased their politicized identification, but this effect was absent when they had a leadership role. Moreover, including advantaged group members in a protest increased the belief that solidarity is a normative behavior and the expectations that a protest will be peaceful among observers. Implications for research on allyship are discussed. © 2021 The Authors. Political Psychology published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of International Society of Political Psychology.

AB  - Although projecting one’s own characteristics onto another person is pervasive, “counter-projection,” or seeing the opposite of oneself in others is also sometimes found, with implications for intergroup conflict. After a focused review of previous studies finding counter-projection (often unexpectedly), we map conditions for counter-projection to an individual out-group member. Counter-projection requires identified antagonistic groups, is moderated by in-group identity, and is moderated by which information is assessed in the target person. Using political groups defined by support for former U.S. President Trump, across our Initial Experiment (N = 725) and Confirmatory Experiment (N = 618), we found counter-projection to individual political out-group targets for moral beliefs, personality traits, and everyday likes (e.g., preference for dogs vs. cats). Counter-projection was increased by in-group identification and overlapped considerably with “oppositional” out-group stereotypes, but we also found counter-projection independent of out-group stereotypes (degree of overlap with stereotyping depended on the information being projected). © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - What factors influence an individual's concern for personal security and safety? Prior research shows that women exhibit higher levels of fear, anxiety, and perceived threat. These differences in threat perceptions have important policy consequences, including the fact that women display lower support for military interventions, lower support for retaliation against terrorist groups, and lower levels of support for using torture. However, previous research has not fully investigated the origins of these differences in concern for safety and security, which we refer to as “personal security dispositions.” We ask if these differences are the result of lived experience, socialization, or both. Specifically, our analysis explores the extent to which personal security dispositions can be traced to parental warnings about safety and avoiding danger. Our findings indicate that both gender identity and parental socialization have an impact on security dispositions. We conclude the article with a discussion of avenues for further research and the policy implications of our findings, in particular with respect to public opinion on issues such as support for the international use of military force. © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - In recent years, the co-occurrence of the migration crisis and terrorist attacks in European cities have created a strong link between refugees and asylum seekers and terrorism in the minds of many Europeans. This study investigates how attitudes toward refugees are associated with fear of terrorism. Using multilevel modelling on 1,500 Belgian citizens nested in 402 municipalities, results indicate that positive attitudes toward refugees are associated with lower terrorism fear. Adverse economic conditions at both the individual and municipal level are associated with greater fear of terrorism, while a large outgroup size is associated with lower fear of terrorism. Women hold greater fear than men, while commercial news consumption is associated with greater terrorism fears. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - What shapes Americans' attitudes toward and about Native Americans? Public opinion research acknowledges that race and ethnicity are a factor in shaping US public opinion. Native Americans have been almost entirely excluded from this research. But we do know that, despite being a relatively small population, the general public holds stereotypes and false narratives about Native Americans that have been perpetuated by popular culture, education curriculum, and national myths. In this paper, we use new and original data collected under the Reclaiming Native Truth project to examine the factors that shape attitudes toward Native Americans. More specifically, we examine individual and contextual factors that shape views of discrimination against Native Americans and resentment toward Native Americans. We find that political ideology (liberal versus conservative) and the reliance on Native American stereotypes are factors most consistently associated with resentment and attitudes about Native American discrimination, although direct personal experiences and factual knowledge also matter. Our findings contribute to conversations about attitudes toward racial and ethnic minority groups and emerging scholarship on the role of political attitudes in settler-colonial societies.

AB  - Purpose: The massive amount of available information and functionality of the Internet makes selective information seeking effortless. This paper aims to understand the selective exposure to information during a health decision-making task. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted an experiment with a sample of 36 students to examine the influence of prior attitude, perceived threat level and information limit on users’ selective exposure to and recall of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination information. Participants were assigned to two conditions with or without an upper limit of the number of articles to be examined, and this study collected the number of articles read, the number of articles included in the report and recall score of the articles after one day of the experiment. Findings: This study found that (1) participants with a negative attitude were more inclined to view attitude-consistent information and recalled attitude-consistent information more accurately, while participants with a positive attitude viewed more balanced information; (2) participants perceiving higher health threat level recalled attitude-consistent information more accurately; and (3) an upper limit on the number of articles to be viewed does not have any impact on selective exposure. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this paper pinpoint the disparity of influence of positive and negative attitudes on selective exposure to and selective recall of health information, which was not previously recognized. Practical implications: Vaccination campaigns should focus on reaching people with negative attitudes who are more prone to selective exposure to encourage them to seek more balanced information. Originality/value: This is the first paper to explore selective exposure to COVID-19 vaccination information. This study found that people with a negative attitude and a higher level of perceived health threat are more prone to selective exposure, which was not found in previous research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Perspective-taking (PT) is an important ability to imagine the world from another’s point of view. Prior studies have shown that younger adults are more likely to consider the opinions of age-based in-group members relative to out-group members. However, the cause of this priority is still unknown. We conducted three independent studies to explore the effect of intergenerational contact on younger adults’ PT toward older adults and the possible roles of stereotyping and intergroup anxiety. A total of 192 college students completed the Perspective taking Scale in Study 1 after being primed with age-based intergroup relationships. The results indicated that younger adults found it more difficult to take the perspective of older adults than that of their peers. 200 college students completed the Prior Contact Scale, Intergroup Anxiety Scale, Negative Stereotype Scale, and PT Scale in Study 2. The results demonstrated that intergenerational contact improved PT toward older adults by disrupting negative stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety moderated this mediating relationship. A total of 215 college students completed the PT Scale in the context of imagining intergenerational contact in Study 3. Interestingly, imagined contact effectively increased younger adults’ ability to take older adults’ perspectives. The present research verifies that contact is important for influencing younger adults’ emotional (intergroup anxiety) and attitudinal (stereotyping) factors that are critical to improving younger adults’ ability to take older people’s perspectives. This is of great significance for developing harmonious intergenerational relationships. Copyright © 2022 Long, Jiang, Wang, Zhou and You.

AB  - Purpose: Group criticism plays an important role in intergroup relations and conflicts, but few studies have related group criticism to intercultural communication contexts. This study aims to explore two cultural groups’ (Chinese international students in the USA and American domestic students) collective face concern as a unique experience in intercultural communication and other psychological responses while encountering group criticism targeting their country image. Design/methodology/approach: A laboratory experiment was conducted assessing Chinese international students (n = 115) and American domestic students’ (n = 100) responses to a research-confederate critic (whose group membership was manipulated) criticizing participants’ country image such as blaming China and the USA for air pollution or using drugs in the Olympics. analysis of covariance, correlational analysis and regression analysis were adopted to analyze the data. Findings: Chinese international students reported higher collective face concerns and lower liking toward the critic compared with American students. When criticism specifically targeted participants’ country image, Chinese international students reported more discomfort feelings than American students; and while responding to the critic who identified as participants’ ingroup member, Chinese international students’ discomfort feelings were more susceptible to their collective face than American students in the same condition. Originality/value: This study illustrates cultural differences in collective face concerns and psychological reactions in responding to criticism targeting a country image in intercultural communication contexts. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Understanding the legacy of settler colonialism requires understanding the nature and scope of anti-Indigenous attitudes. But what, exactly, are the political consequences of anti-Indigenous attitudes? Answering this question requires recognizing that attitudes toward Indigenous peoples are distinct from White racial attitudes toward other disempowered groups. In this paper, I introduce a novel measure of Indigenous resentment. I then show that Indigenous resentment is an important predictor of policy attitudes using data collected from an original survey of White settlers. I estimate the effect of both Indigenous resentment and negative affect on policy attitudes—opposition to welfare and support for pipeline developments—to make the case that Indigenous resentment is a better measure of anti-Indigenous attitudes than affective prejudice, and that Indigenous resentment is an important omitted variable in the study of public opinion in settler societies.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this paper is to investigate the behavioural intention to use the Poison Information System (PIS) among healthcare professionals based on the extension of the Technology Acceptance Model. Methods: A quantitative approach used a five-point Likert scale questionnaire adapted from previous research. Data were obtained from 136 health professionals working in the Emergency Department of public hospitals in Malaysia. Results: A multiple linear regression model showed that approximately 40% of the variation in intention to use was related to positive attitude, staff category, and inversely to computer anxiety. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and computer usage were related to intention to use, but their correlation was accounted for by positive attitude, staff category, and computer anxiety. A factor analysis grouped positive attitude, intention to use, and perceived usefulness on Factor I and perceived ease of use, inverse computer anxiety, and computer habit on Factor II. Cluster analysis indicated three clusters. Gender, age, experience, and staff category were strongly inter-related; intention to use clustered with perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; positive attitude clustered with computer habit; and the latter two clustered together. Conclusion: These findings show that positive attitude, staff category, and computer anxiety of healthcare professionals, working in emergency departments, may have the greatest effect on PIS usage. © 2022 UPM Press.

AB  - Drawing on ethnographic material from Gitanos of Spain and current EU Roma integration policies, we explore the contemporary construction of the Roma ethnic group category as a specific type of “stranger” in the context of the European neoliberal culture complex. Our argument is that this classificatory reconstruction can be seen to work as a cultural prerequisite for the socio-political shaping and management of the Roma as a neoliberal “stable stranger.” This new stranger is based on constructing Roma as a potential unused labor pool and as recent immigrants, in contrast to the Gitanos’ own ideology and locally grounded identity of self-employment and anti-proletarianism. The paradoxical consequence of the integration policies, therefore, is the potential pushing of the Gitanos further away from Spanish mainstream society. © The Authors

AB  - Background Inadequate complementary feeding is a major cause of childhood malnutrition. Malnutrition caused by insufficient complementary feeding accounts for more than one-third of all under-five mortality whereas appropriate feeding practices are critical for improving nutritional status and ensuring child survival. Thus, the objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of appropriate complementary feeding practices among mothers having 6–23 months children, from Feb.-march 2020 and associated factors in Shashemene Town, Oromia, Ethiopia. Methods From February to March of 2020, a community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. 536 mothers with children aged 6 to 23 months were chosen for the study using a two-stage sampling procedure. Data was collected by Face-to-face interviews during home-to-home visits with mothers who had children aged 6–23 months, using a structured questionnaire on the main complementary feeding indicators. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used to analyze the data. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with appropriate complementary feeding practice, with statistical significance set at probability value < 0.05. Results The proportion of children aged 6–23 months who met the criteria for complementary food introduction, minimum meal frequency, minimum dietary diversity, minimum acceptable diet, and appropriate complementary feeding practices was 67.9 percent, 61.7 percent, 42.5 percent, 41.7 percent, and 30 percent, respectively. Child age 12–17 and 18–23 months were the independent factors associated with appropriate complementary feed practice [adjusted odd ratio (AOR): 2.32, 95 percent confidence interval (CI): (1.40–3.82)]. ** 1.91 (1.10–3.32) **. Socioeconomic status: mothers in the wealth index of the household, second, third, and fourth, [AOR: 4.27,95 percent, CI (1.8–10.22) ** 4.02(2.23–9.94) ** 7.02 (3.27–15.1) **], number of antenatal care visits greater than or equal to four [AOR: 2.57,95 percent, CI: (1.3–5.05)] **, information sources [AOR: 3.5,95 percent, CI: (1.45–8.26) **]. Conclusion This study found that children aged 6–23 months had a low level of appropriate complementary feeding practice. Mothers with children aged 6–11 months, the number of antenatal care (ANC) visits, socioeconomic status, sources of information, mothers’ knowledge, and positive attitude were all associated with appropriate feeding practices. As a result, nutritional education/counseling intervention on child feeding practices was suggested. Copyright: © 2022 Ahmed et al.

AB  - Participation in collective action is known to be driven by two appraisals of a social situation: Beliefs that the situation is unfair (injustice appraisal) and beliefs that a group can change the situation (collective efficacy appraisal). Anger has been repeatedly found to mediate the relationship between injustice appraisals and collective action. Recent work suggests that the emotion of being moved mediates the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Building on this prior work, the present research applies kama muta theory to further investigate the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Kama muta is a positive emotion that is evoked by a sudden intensification of communal sharing, and largely overlaps with the English concept being moved. We investigated its relationship with collective action in both advantaged and disadvantaged racial groups in the context of the Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM) in Spring of 2020. In one pilot study (N = 78) and one main study (N = 215), we confirmed that anger toward the system of racial inequalities mediated between injustice and collective action intentions, and that kama muta toward the movement mediated between collective efficacy and collective action intentions. Both mediations were found for both Black and White participants. We also observed additional unpredicted paths from anger to kama muta and from efficacy to anger. Together, this provides evidence for the pivotal role of emotions in collective action intentions, but also points out that appraisals need to be better understood.

AB  - Research on hostile media perception (HMP) has suggested that both news slants and partisan source cues influence individuals’ perception of news bias. Yet, relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that the two message features may interact. Extending the literature on HMP, the present experiment investigates the content-source interaction in the context of President Trump’s policy on immigration, with two audience characteristics as potential moderators: political ideology strength (PIS) and need for cognition (NFC). Results show that (1) the effect of news slants on HMP is greater when the news is from an in-group source and (2) such interaction is more pronounced for those with higher levels of PIS and lower levels of NFC. Implications for our understanding of HMP and for public opinion in an increasingly fragmented and partisan media environment will be discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Our paper tackles the topic of the digital technologies (represented by the information and communication technologies (ICT)) and the sustainable transformation and energy safety in households represented by the smart homes and the traditional households using smart appliances, gadgets, as well as smart meters connected to the Internet. The rapid growth and adoption of information and communication technologies, such as computers, mobile devices, sensors, and networks, can seriously affect the ways and amounts of energy used by society on its path toward sustainable development. There is a growing interest in characterizing the net energy impact of ICT as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) that arises from indirect effects that offset (or amplify) the energy directly consumed by ICT equipment. However, the society might need some time to build the trust in these new digital technologies and develop the wide social acceptance for their usage. In order to test these assumptions, we employ an empirical econometric model based on the data obtained from the online survey carried out with the randomly selected respondents (N = 523) from Russian Federation and the four European Union (EU) countries (Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia). Even with regard to the small size of the sample and thence the limitations stemming from that fact, our results demonstrate that familiarity with smart home technologies and the possibility to alter the tariffs and use flexible energy demand increase the safety of residents and consumers. In addition, it appears that energy efficiency is being rewarded, as energy consumption is sensitive to time constraints on supply. Furthermore, we find that respondents’ age (43% of the respondents belonged to the 36–55 age group), positive attitude to smart home technologies and the possibility to exploit the flexibility of demand offered by the variety of energy tariffs during and off-peaks all yield quite strong and positive relationships and correlations with the willingness to accept the smart home technology and the flexibility of demand. At the same time, concerns over personal security or sharing personal data related to energy consumption do not constitute major concerns for the respondents. Our results have some important impacts on the overall strategy for pursuing sustainable economic development and following the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that might be useful for stakeholders and policymakers as well as for the researchers in this field. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Social injustices toward minority groups are pervasive around the world, and further exacerbated by global threats such as COVID-19 and climate change. Prosocial tendencies, such as empathy, moral reasoning, and helping behaviors directed only toward members of one's own social groups, discriminate against outgroups, and can perpetuate an unjust status quo. Yet, recent meta-analyses point to effective intervention programs that can foster prosocial responses across group lines. Developmental science has identified evidence-based interventions, policies, and programs to foster inclusive prosocial tendencies (toward both in-group and out-group members) to redress social injustices and inequities, and ultimately, lead to more just and peaceful societies. The recent developmental science informs five policy principles (e.g., developmental science, resilience, culture, collaboration, and sustainability) that can advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around inclusion and peace. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality among White, Black, and American In-dian/Alaska Native (AIAN) men are attributable to differences in early detection screening. Deter-mining how masculinity barriers influence CRC screening completion is critical for cancer prevention and control. To determine whether masculinity barriers to medical care are associated with lower rates of ever completing CRC screening, a survey-based study was employed from December 2020– January 2021 among 435 White, Black, and AIAN men (aged 45–75) who resided in the US. Logistic regression models were fit to four Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care subscales predicting ever completing CRC screening. For all men, being strong was associated with 54% decreased odds of CRC screening completion (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94); each unit increase in negative attitudes toward medical professionals and exams decreased the odds of ever completing CRC screening by 57% (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.86). Black men who scored higher on negativity toward medical professionals and exams had decreased odds of ever screening. Consideration of masculinity in future population-based and intervention research is critical for increasing men’s participation in CRC screening, with more salience for Black men. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The current study investigated how media exposure to a distant outgroup – asylum seekers in the European Union (EUAS) – may be associated with the transference of geographically distant foreign threats via Israeli media to Israeli local minorities. The study was based on an online survey of 1039 Israeli Jews. We found positive associations between frequency of exposure to negative EUAS media content and physical and symbolic threats domesticated from foreign outgroups to the local ground. Frequent exposure to negative EUAS media content was associated with worse attitudes toward asylum seekers in Israel. Thus, the media framing of remote groups and events can have important, long-lasting local consequences, including, most obviously, social and political implications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Cultural cues can affect individuals’ experiences and attitudes. The headscarf is one such cue, as a symbol strongly associated with Islam that is often the subject of public discussion. In the present study (N = 94), a Turkish experimenter wore vs. did not wear a headscarf while handing out questionnaires in a German town square. Analyzes showed that in the “headscarf condition”, participants reported higher negative stereotypes of Turkish Muslims, less warmth and more symbolic threat associated with this group than in the “non-headscarf condition”. No differences in competence ratings were found, which supports the primacy of warmth. Furthermore, acculturation preferences did not differ between conditions. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Following the signing of peace agreements, post-accord societies often remain deeply divided across group lines. There is a need to identify antecedents of youth’s support for peace and establish more constructive intergroup relations. This article explored the effect of out-group trust, intergroup forgiveness, and social identity on support for the peace process among youth from the historic majority and minority communities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The sample comprised 667 adolescents (49% male; M = 15.74, SD = 1.99 years old) across two time points. The results from the structural equation model suggested that out-group trust was related to intergroup forgiveness over time, while forgiveness related to later support for the peace process. Strength of in-group social identity differentially moderated how out-group trust and intergroup forgiveness related to later support for peace among youth from the conflict-related groups (i.e., Protestants and Catholics). Implications for consolidating peace in Northern Ireland are discussed, which may be relevant to other settings affected by intergroup conflict. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: To review the evidence of felt and enacted stigma and attitudes toward persons living with epilepsy, and their determining factors. Methods: Thirteen databases were searched (1985–2019). Abstracts were reviewed in duplicate and data were independently extracted using a standardized form. Studies were characterized using descriptive analysis by whether they addressed “felt” or “enacted” stigma and “attitudes” toward persons living with epilepsy. Results: Of 4234 abstracts, 132 met eligibility criteria and addressed either felt or enacted stigma and 210 attitudes toward epilepsy. Stigma frequency ranged broadly between regions. Factors associated with enacted stigma included low level of knowledge about epilepsy, lower educational level, lower socioeconomic status, rural areas living, and religious grouping. Negative stereotypes were often internalized by persons with epilepsy, who saw themselves as having an “undesirable difference” and so anticipated being treated differently. Felt stigma was associated with increased risk of psychological difficulties and impaired quality of life. Felt stigma was linked to higher seizure frequency, recency of seizures, younger age at epilepsy onset or longer duration, lower educational level, poorer knowledge about epilepsy, and younger age. An important finding was the potential contribution of epilepsy terminology to the production of stigma. Negative attitudes toward those with epilepsy were described in 100% of included studies, and originated in any population group (students, teachers, healthcare professionals, general public, and those living with epilepsy). Better attitudes were generally noted in those of younger age or higher educational status. Significance: Whatever the specific beliefs about epilepsy, implications for felt and enacted stigma show considerable commonality worldwide. Although some studies show improvement in attitudes toward those living with epilepsy over time, much work remains to be done to improve attitudes and understand the true occurrence of discrimination against persons with epilepsy. © 2022 International League Against Epilepsy

AB  - Purpose: Perceived discrimination, perceptions of receiving differential treatment due to negative attitudes, and stereotypes about one's racial/ethnic group can increase vulnerability to depression and anxiety. Although ethnic minority youth now represent over half of the U.S. youth population, few studies have investigated potential protective factors in the relationship between perceived discrimination and mental health across diverse ethnic minority immigrant youth from different cultural backgrounds. Methods: We examined the association between perceived discrimination and past week symptoms of depression and anxiety and whether patterns of problem and emotion-focused coping moderate these relationships among Somali and Hispanic immigrant youth (N = 353) in an urban midwestern setting (mean age = 15; 53% male, 39% first generation, 75% low income). Path analysis models examined the main effects of perceived discrimination for depression and anxiety and whether problem and emotion-focused coping moderated these associations. Results: Path analysis models suggest that perceived discrimination was positively associated with past week symptoms of depression (β = .37, standard error = .06) and anxiety (β = .16, standard error = .06) across ethnicity. However, adolescents who reported high levels of discrimination and who used predominantly problem-focused coping strategies experienced fewer internalizing problems than youth who relied predominantly on emotion-focused coping strategies. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that strengthening youths’ problem-focused coping strategies in the face of discriminatory stress is a promising health promotion and risk prevention approach. © 2021 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine

AB  - The existing integration literature in the Chinese context has mostly focused on migrants' relations with receiving contexts, such as place attachment and settlement intention. Few attempts have been made to investigate migrants' relations with local residents, a better indicator of migrants' integration. Based on the 2014 China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this study scrutinises how environmental factors and individual factors affect migrants' intergroup relations in China. The analysis shows that migrants who live in more migrant-concentrated neighbourhoods and who stay in more developed cities with a higher presence of migrants tend to suffer from worse intergroup relations. This implies that no matter at which level the migrant concentration exists, it can hinder migrants' intergroup relations. Moreover, both higher socioeconomic status and acculturation can significantly improve migrants' intergroup relations, indicating that acculturation also plays an important role in the relatively homogeneous society. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Social psychology’s search for ways to address intergroup inequality has grappled with two approaches that have been considered incompatible: (a) the prejudice reduction approach, that argues that changing individual negative attitudes will undermine the basis for discrimination and lead to intergroup harmony; and (b) the collective action approach, that argues that social protest and activism can improve the position of disadvantaged groups. The problem is that efforts toward prejudice reduction may serve to suppress genuine efforts to change. We propose the Achieving Multicultural Integration of Groups Across Society (AMIGAS) model, in which a multicultural commitment is proposed as a driver of both improved intergroup evaluations and promotion of collective action for reduced inequality, especially in contexts where there are conditions for a respectful intercultural dialogue. The AMIGAS model is a theoretical advance in the field of intergroup relations and a basis for implementing effective egalitarian policies and practices. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Recently, social identity approach has been giving stimulating insights in leadership in sport, considering social identification as a consequence regarding leadership processes. Nonetheless, social identity theory fundamentally posits social identification as a subjacent parameter of cognitions implied in the frame of interpersonal and intergroup relations. The current study aimed to enrich the existing literature by investigating athletes’ team identification as a predictor of the perception of coach-created climate. French male rugby union players (N = 248) completed an online survey measuring the multidimensionality of their social identification to the team, and their perception of the coach-created climate in terms of empowering and disempowering motivational climate. Using Group Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling, the analyses revealed that the perception of the climate as empowering was driven by high scores on ingroup ties, especially when teammates’ ingroup ties scores were low. Team's ingroup affect and cognitive centrality resulted in lower perception levels of the empowering climate. Neither player's ingroup ties nor cognitive centrality predicted the perception of the climate as empowering, and when player's ingroup affect fitted into the group, his perception of a disempowering motivational climate decreased when ingroup affect score was high. The results are mainly discussed to the light of intergroup permeability by underlying the importance of considering social identification as a predictor of the perception of coach-athletes’ relationship. Some practical applications are put forward along with future directions for research on coach-athletes’ relationship. Especially, this study points out the importance of considering the social identity approach of leadership as a transactional relationship encapsulated in a mutual influence between the ingroup member social identification and that of the team as a whole. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The racial animus model argues that public support for punitive sentencing of criminal offenders is shaped by threat perceptions associated with cultural minority groups. This study applies the racial animus model to examine support for the punitive sentencing of criminal offenders in the United States and Australia. It also examines whether racial animus mediates the possible difference in punitive attitudes between each country toward different crime types. Online survey data were obtained in the US and Australia to assess racial animus and punitive attitudes using six different crime scenarios. Results indicate that (a) individuals with higher levels of racial animus demonstrate greater levels of punitiveness; (b) Australians have higher levels of racial animus as compared to their US counterparts; and (c) racial animus mediates the difference of punitive attitudes between the two countries. Overall, punitive attitudes and racial animus vary cross-culturally, with Australians demonstrating more racial animus. Our mediation model provides evidence for the importance of racial animus in the cross-cultural demand for the punishment of criminal offenders. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Concerns have been raised about weakening social cohesion in French society against the backdrop of economic slowdown over the last decade. To understand how economic conditions are associated with social cohesion, this study analyzes the correlations between individual and macroeconomic indicators and social cohesion attitudes as well as their cross-level interaction. The results from pooled OLS regressions with year fixed effects using French European Social Survey data (2008–2018) show that individual economic strain is associated with lower social trust and with higher egalitarian and anti-immigrant attitudes. Cross-level interaction results suggest that strained individuals can have stronger egalitarian and anti-immigrant propensities under a macroeconomic downturn. As a result, larger variations in public attitudes can occur, which could pose a risk to the value consensus and social order. The results of this study suggest potential negative consequences of micro- and macroeconomic hardship for various dimensions of social cohesion and suggest the need for a comprehensive policy strategy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - For group discussions about fraught racial topics between Black and White Americans to be beneficial, conversation participants must view the person who facilitates as effective at communicating both the perspectives of Black and White Americans. We identify a biracial advantage in this domain. In three studies (total N = 710), we tested how a facilitator’s race affects their perceived effectiveness in communicating with both Black and White Americans. Both Black and White participants expected Black and White monoracial facilitators to more effectively engage with racial in-group than racial out-group members. However, they expected biracial facilitators to be equally effective in communicating with both Black and White groups. Both Black and White participants also expected biracial facilitators to use productive learning strategies (perspective taking, showing empathy) more than White facilitators, and either more than or equally to Black facilitators, suggesting one reason why people expect biracial facilitators to perform well in these moments. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Does commitment to allyship from a dominant group member cue identity-safety for women in male-dominated environments? We examine this question by assessing women’s perceptions of workplaces that included the presence (vs. absence) of a male ally (Studies 1–3) or a female ally (Study 3), and determine the impact of Black versus White allies for Black and White women. Across three studies (N = 1,032) and an integrative data analysis, we demonstrate that an equality-supportive male ally reduces anticipated isolation and workplace hostility and increases anticipated support, respect, and gender-equality norms for women in general populations (Studies 1 and 2) and women in science, technology, and math (Study 3). These results represent a possible strategy to help retain women in male-dominated fields. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Dominant majority-group members living in areas with larger proportions of outgroup members tend to express more ingroup bias. However, prior research has rarely considered this in tandem with the bias-reducing effects of intergroup contact or tested whether outgroup proportions have similar effects for oppressed minority-group members. In two preregistered studies, we tested whether contact moderates the association between outgroup proportions and ingroup bias among White and Black Americans (total N > 75,000). As hypothesized, more Black residents in an area predicted greater explicit (but not implicit) ingroup bias among White respondents who reported low (but not high) contact with Black people. By contrast, more White residents in an area predicted lower explicit (but not implicit) ingroup bias among Black respondents regardless of intergroup contact with White people. We qualify previous findings by demonstrating that the association between outgroup proportions and ingroup bias depends on one’s group membership and level of intergroup contact. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - What role does social dominance orientation theory play in explaining anti-immigrant violence in the South African context? Despite its popularity, studies of intergroup conflict in South Africa have tended to ignore the role of social dominance orientation theory in predicting aggression against minority groups. The article explores this role by examining whether a social dominance orientation can act as a determinant of mass opinion on, and personal engagement in, violence against foreign nationals in a large heterogeneous population. The impact of social dominance orientation will be assessed using the SDO7(s) Scale. Data from the 2018 round of the South African Social Attitudes Survey (N = 2885) was utilised for this study. Rejection of group-based dominance and a preference for outgroup inclusion was found to be quite normative among the general public. Social dominance orientation proves to be a valid correlate of hostility against foreign nationals. The present study demonstrated that a social dominance orientation was positively associated with individual participation in anti-immigrant violence. In addition, the study showed that the SDO7(s) was negatively correlated with both positive contact with foreign nationals and a welcoming predisposition towards this group. The research demonstrates the applicability of the SDO7(s) Scale in a South African context. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Negative attitudes towards out-groups have been of academic interest for many years — and even more so with the increased levels of migration to European countries in recent years. Building on insights from intergroup contact theory, this paper seeks to extend our knowledge of the association between contact and negative attitudes toward immigrants among youth in Sweden. Multiple regression analysis and fixed effects models are used to analyze a large, high-quality dataset on Swedish adolescents based on representative survey information, complemented with extensive registry data and official statistics. Our objective is to measure contact on different levels in order to better understand the importance of these different contact variables’ associations with negative attitudes. The results of the analysis indicate that high-quality contact in the form of friendship is associated with a reduction in negative attitudes among Swedish adolescents, even after controlling for background variables. Superficial forms of contact — measured on the school level — are, on the other hand, associated with an increase in negative attitudes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Evidence suggests that as public opinion towards immigration becomes more negative, so the descriptive representation of ethnic minority groups is increasingly restricted. Recently, some initial research into the causal mechanism hinted that this effect is driven by patterns of candidacy. This suggests that political parties are creating an ‘ethnic penalty’ of their own in the selection stage. This paper investigates the relationship between patterns of candidacy, party strategy, and public opinion in Great Britain from 1997 to 2019, and proposes that ‘punitive parties’ are strongly responsible for shaping the representational outcomes of minority groups. I find support for earlier suggestions that parties are increasingly likely to place ethnic minority candidates away from ‘winnable’ contests as anti-immigrant hostility rises. These findings are important for our conceptions of ethnic penalties, of party behaviour in selection processes, and for the study and cause of improving political representation. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) has often been referred to as an “empathy machine.” This is mostly because it can induce empathy through embodiment experiences in outgroup membership. However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience. The experiment showed that satisfying degrees of body ownership of participants’ own avatar and co-presence with the contacted avatar can be achieved in simple and universally accessible virtual environments such as AltspaceVR. The results indicated that while VR intergroup contact had no significant direct effect on empathy, exploratory analyses indicated that post-intervention empathic interest increased with stronger feelings of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition.

AB  - Researchers have considered the role of perceived threat and fear of crime in shaping attitudes about gun regulation. We contribute to this literature by examining whether gun owners, who tend to oppose gun regulations, moderate their gun views when exposed to a gun-related threat. We argue that although exposure to threat can increase the desire to be armed, gun owners primed with a threat may soften their views on gun regulation relative to non-gun owners. We employ an experiment embedded within a nationally representative survey to test our hypotheses. Our analysis of the data from our survey supports the notion that gun owners generally oppose gun regulations, but exposure to a gun-related threat moderates their opposition to gun regulations. We discuss the limitations of our study and conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for understanding public support for gun regulation in America. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In the transition from Fordist to flexible accumulation in the last decades of the twentieth century, social reproduction was externalized onto families and communities. In the United States, this “crisis of care” was mitigated by the incorporation of illegalized Mexican immigrants’ low-cost reproductive labor in private and public services. From a feminist perspective on social reproduction and migration, we argue that the impacts of the COVID-19 economic crisis on Mexican immigrant communities were related to the specific ways that immigrants’ labor was incorporated into the circuits of social reproduction. Drawing on interviews with migrants from rural central Mexico in the United States, we analyze how immigrants absorbed the worst effects of the crisis by cheapening their labor, transferring unpaid reproductive labor to other household members, and engaging in informalized activities. Anti-immigrant policies exacerbated the precarious situations of undocumented immigrants and mixed-status Mexican families during the pandemic. ©2022 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - To develop tourism products and campaigns that will not just help Japanese hot springs survive but revive and sustain them in the future, it is imperative to understand the behavioral intentions of its visitors during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aims to investigate how the important market of senior Japanese visitors is characterized by their attitudes and feelings toward visiting hot springs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, it explores whether external travel incentives can increase seniors’ intention to visit. A market research study was conducted on Japanese nationals, using 507 questionnaires. A factor analysis generated five attitude dimensions: (1) response efficacy, (2) perceived COVID-19 infectability, (3) self-efficacy, (4) crowding perception and feeling, and (5) perceived threat severity. Through k-means cluster anal-ysis, the segmentation produced three distinct tourist segments: trusting seniors, concerned seniors, and indifferent seniors. Each segment is clearly described in terms of attitudes, considering distinct sociodemographic characteristics. Practical suggestions on managing and targeting these segments are also discussed. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Public support is fundamental in scaling up actions to limit global warming. Here, we analyse how the experience of climate extremes influences people’s environmental attitudes and willingness to vote for Green parties in Europe. To this end, we combined high-resolution climatological data with regionally aggregated, harmonized Eurobarometer data (34 countries) and European Parliamentary electoral data (28 countries). Our findings show a significant and sizeable effect of temperature anomalies, heat episodes and dry spells on environmental concern and voting for Green parties. The magnitude of the climate effect differs substantially across European regions. It is stronger in regions with a cooler Continental or temperate Atlantic climate and weaker in regions with a warmer Mediterranean climate. The relationships are moderated by regional income level suggesting that climate change experiences increase public support for climate action but only under favourable economic conditions. The findings have important implications for the current efforts to promote climate action in line with the Paris Agreement. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents a study on the dynamics of sentiment polarisation in the active online discussion communities formed around a controversial topic—immigration. Using a collection of tweets in the Swedish language from 2012 to 2019, we track the development of the communities and their sentiment polarisation trajectories over time and in the context of an exogenous shock represented by the European refugee crisis in 2015. To achieve the goal of the study, we apply methods of network and sentiment analysis to map users’ interactions in the network communities and quantify users’ sentiment polarities. The results of the analysis give little evidence for users’ polarisation in the network and its communities, as well as suggest that the crisis had a limited effect on the polarisation dynamics on this social media platform. Yet, we notice a shift towards more negative tonality of users’ sentiments after the crisis and discuss possible explanations for the above-mentioned observations. © 2022 Kopacheva, Yantseva.

AB  - A common European identity is an important part of the European political lexicon; however, at the institutional level, it was taken seriously only when the economic crisis, the legal challenges of EU integration, and the Brexit story encouraged a fresh look into the problem. Moreover, the European identity problem may be viewed differently from the Western and Eastern European perspectives, which helps to identify the roots of contemporary “official” and “sociological” perceptions of a common European identity. The Standard Eurobarometer (EB) questionaries were used as a proxy to analyze the interest of the EU in a common European identity. We analyzed the types of questions asked from 2004 to 2020 and took a look at the responses. The shifts in the composition of the Standard EB questionaries signal that the “official” understanding of identity is gaining ground against the “sociological” approach. The promotion by official bodies of the EU of a one-sided understanding of a common European identity, based on the Western approach, narrows the field and creates certain risks. In the face of a permanent EU-ropean unity crisis, it would not be wise to lose one of the important instruments that could be successfully used to identify the hidden challenges of the future. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Community energy is seen as a helping hand for local, decentralized energy transition. Besides the main goal of supporting the community-friendly and socially acceptable development of renewable energies, the hope is also that a pro-environmental influence on sustainability behavior will be triggered when joining a community energy project. An analysis of a survey among 16 community energy projects in Germany, with 565 completed questionnaires, shows that a certain part of the members pays more attention to their energy behavior and develop a more positive attitude towards a decentralized energy transition and citizen participation after joining the community energy project. Therefore, we can empirically support that climate protection projects, such as community energy, influence pro-environmental attitudes and behavior, but this does not apply equally to all population groups. Members with higher income and stronger interest in returns are less likely to change their behavior. Based on these findings, we recommend the development of community energy policies that are more responsive to differences in social structure and address both privileged and underprivileged groups in a sophisticated way using specific offers and modes of involvement within the associations. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: There are racial differences in COVID-19 vaccination rates, but social factors, such as lack of health insurance or food insecurity, may explain some of the racial disparities. Objective: To assess social factors, including insurance coverage, that may affect COVID-19 vaccination as of June–July 2021 and vaccine hesitancy among those not yet vaccinated, and how these may affect racial equity in vaccinations. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative survey data. Participants: Adults 18 to 64 participating in the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey for June 23 to July 5, 2021. Main Measures: Vaccination: receipt of at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy: among those not yet vaccinated, intent to definitely or probably not get vaccinated. Key Results: In unadjusted analyses, black adults were less likely to be vaccinated than other respondents, but, after social factors were included, including health insurance status, food sufficiency, income and education, and state-level political preferences, differences between black and white adults were no longer significant and Hispanics were more likely to be vaccinated (OR = 1.87, p <.001). Among those not yet vaccinated, black and Hispanic adults were vaccine hesitant than white adults (ORs =.37 and.45, respectively, both p <.001) and insurance status and food insufficiency were not significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy. The percent of state voters for former President Trump in 2020 was significantly associated with lower vaccination rates and with increased vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: The results indicate that much of the gap in COVID vaccination rates for minority adults are due to social barriers, rather than differences in racial attitudes. Unvaccinated minority adults expressed less vaccine hesitancy than white adults. Social barriers like food insecurity and insurance coverage could have deterred prompt COVID-19 vaccinations. Reducing these problems might help increase vaccination rates. © 2021, Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - As protests erupted across the United States in recent years over racialized issues (e.g., Black Lives Matter and Confederate monuments), so too did questions about when and how police should respond. Understanding public attitudes toward protest policing is important for police legitimacy and policy. One theory is that citizens are willing to trade civil liberties, such as the right to assemble, for security, and thus disruptive or dangerous protest tactics should increase support for police control by elevating public fear. Another theory is that citizens view protests through the lens of group position, and thus, they should be more supportive of repression when protest goals conflict with preexisting racial beliefs and threaten racial interests. To test these theories, we embedded an experiment in a nationwide survey fielded in 2020 after George Floyd's killing sparked the broadest protests in U.S. history. We randomized protest tactics (e.g., weapon carrying) and goals, as well as other contextual characteristics (e.g., protest size). We found that the public generally opposed repressive protest policing. Certain protest tactics, however, increased support for repression by elevating fear. Protest goals (e.g., pro-Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrants) also impacted support for repression, but the effect depended on respondents’ racial beliefs. © 2021 American Society of Criminology

AB  - Unfair advantages can be created either intentionally (e.g., cheating) or unintentionally (e.g., unintended benefit). Little is known regarding how children evaluate different types of advantages in situations where group identity and group membership are made salient. To investigate how children's group identity influences their evaluations and attribution of intentions in intergroup contexts, children were presented with three hypothetical advantages (unintentionally unfair, intentionally unfair, and fair) in a competitive context created by either an in-group member or an out-group member. Children (N = 120) were 4–6 years of age (n = 59; Mage = 5.29 years) and 7–10 years of age (n = 61; Mage = 8.34 years), including 64 girls and 56 boys. Participants were 67% European American, 18% African American, 11% Asian American, and 4% Hispanic. All participants were assigned to one of two teams in a contest in order to create an in-group/out-group manipulation prior to their evaluation of the actions. Out-group members viewed unintentional unfair and fair advantages as less acceptable than in-group members, but in-group and out-group members were equally negative in their assessment of an intentional transgression. When reasoning about unintentional and intentional unfair advantages, older children referenced the intentions of the advantage creator to justify their decisions more than younger children, whereas younger children reasoned about the impact of the behavior on their team more than older children. These novel findings shed light on developmental and social factors influencing children's understanding of fairness and intentionality in everyday contexts. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We examined minority-status (non-Cypriot immigrant) and majority-status (Cypriot national) preadolescents’ bystander reactions to, and reasoning about, intergroup social exclusion (N = 367; Mage = 11.7 years; 50% Cypriot). Participants read one of three contexts where victim group identity was either non-Cypriot or Cypriot or a context where identity was not mentioned (i.e., control). Cypriot participants reported higher prosocial bystander responses when Cypriot victims were excluded compared with when non-Cypriot victims were excluded. Non-Cypriot participants reported equally high prosocial bystander responses for Cypriot and non-Cypriot victims, and both were higher than those for the control condition. When choosing to challenge social exclusion, non-Cypriot and Cypriot participants employed moral reasoning, focusing on concerns of welfare and equality. When choosing not to challenge the exclusion, Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice (e.g., “I would not say anything; it is not my problem”) more when victim identity was salient. Non-Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice only when not challenging exclusion in the control context. Cypriot participants with high levels of intergroup contact reported higher helping intentions toward non-Cypriot victims. These findings support and extend social reasoning developmental theory and highlight practical implications for tackling intergroup social exclusion in schools and maintaining positive intergroup relations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We study the non-monetary costs of terrorist attacks in France, Belgium and Germany between 2010 and 2017. Using four waves of the European Social Survey, we find that individual well-being is significantly reduced in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. We explore possible mechanisms, finding that terrorist attacks are negatively correlated with generalized trust, institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy and satisfaction with the government. Terrorist attacks are also found to be positively correlated with negative attitudes towards migrants and perceived discrimination. Contrary to expectations, the negative relationship between terrorism and well-being is less strong for Muslim immigrants. We interpret this finding as an indication that immigrants benefit more than natives from the institutional reaction following terrorist attacks. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article calls for greater attention to immigration attitudes of members of national parliaments (MPs) who absent harmonized immigration policy at the EU level remain the chief decision-makers and are thus responsible for swift government reaction to large influx of immigrants as witnessed in summer 2015 and spring 2020. Against this background, attitudes of MPs toward non-EU immigrants can be highly informative for understanding the foundation and direction of future immigration policy reforms. Although knowledge of MPs immigration attitudes is seemingly important, studies interested in this topic remain scarce. To test the relative importance of identity and economic aspects of MPs' immigration attitudes, this study adopts few well-established theoretical approaches from citizen-level research. Our data come from an MP survey that was administered in 11 Western and Eastern European countries in late 2014 as part of the European National Elites and the Crisis project. Our results suggest that social identity (religiosity) along with political ideology rather than economic concerns drive MPs' immigration attitudes. In addition, we find that in Eastern Europe immigration is only a light force behind political competition unlike in Western Europe, while economic left in Eastern Europe is more anti-immigrant than in Western Europe. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been reported to predict attitudes and behavior toward the natural environment. This research investigated whether dispositional connectedness with and temporary exposure to nature would reversely alter SDO. Two studies reported consistent results: Nature connectedness predicted lower SDO, and exposure to nature (vs. urban) decreased SDO only among nature-connected people. Moreover, the effect of nature exposure was strongest when the environment registered high security features. Study 2 generalized the findings on SDO to people’s policy support for marginalized groups in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are discussed in the light of the transition from people-to-nature connections to interpersonal connections and the heterogeneity of nature’s effect. We conclude by discussing the importance of nature exposure, of which people have been deprived since the global lockdown, in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The article theorises how covering social risks through cash transfers and in-kind services shapes public attitudes towards including/excluding immigrants from these programmes in Western European destination countries. The argument is that public attitudes are more restrictive of granting immigrants access to benefits than to services. This hypothesis is tested across ten social protection programmes using original survey data collected in Denmark, Germany and the UK in 2019. Across the three countries, representing respectively a social democratic, conservative and liberal welfare regime context, the article finds that the public does indeed have a preference for easier access for in-kind services than for cash benefits. The article also finds these results to be stable across programmes covering the same social risks; the examples are child benefits and childcare. The results are even stable across left-wing, mainstream and radical right-wing voters; with the partial exception of radical right-wing voters in the UK. Finally, the article finds only a moderate association between individual characteristics and attitudinal variation across cash benefits and in-kind services. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We propose a theoretical framework for when and why members of dominant groups experience threat and express intolerant attitudes in response to social change. Scholarship on symbolic threat suggests that the detection of intergroup differences in values and norms is sufficient to elicit negative intergroup attitudes. Building on this theory, we argue that the experience of threat is actually shaped by prospective beliefs about difference (i.e., expectations of whether outgroups will assimilate to ingroup norms over time or not). Across two studies and two accompanying pilots, we show how outgroup assimilation expectation shapes dominant groups’ experiences of threat, specifically as it relates to their ability to define the norms of their superordinate category (prototypicality threat). We observe that members of dominant groups are surprisingly tolerant of both social change and intergroup difference in the present, so long as they expect outgroup assimilation in the future. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - This article explores the significance of sports sponsorships by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to limited resources, and the high-intensity competition among sponsors for the recipient’s attention, SMEs have to look for alternative ways to exploit the potential of their sponsorships. With the help of an experimental research design, two studies examine the effects of integrating existing sporting rivalries between sports teams into the leveraging of sponsorships. Among both fans (study 1) and local residents (study 2), the reference to a sporting rivalry in sponsorship leveraging has positive effects on sponsorship-fit, attitudes towards sponsorship and brand attitudes towards the sponsor. Negative attitudes of rival fans on this type of sponsorship leveraging are mostly irrelevant for SME sponsors due to their limited market scope. This type of sponsorship leveraging offers SMEs the opportunity to differentiate themselves as sponsors in contrast to large enterprises with a supra regional, national or international sponsorship scope. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The present meta-analysis summarizes the international basis of evidence regarding links between psychologically meaningful risk factors and political violence outcomes among adolescents and young adults. We synthesized 422 cross-sectional effect sizes from 95 samples (67 index publications, 23 countries), using robust variance estimation. The results of seven longitudinal studies and one intervention study are discussed in a narrative manner. We detected significant effects for depression (r =.07, k = 10); empathy (r = −.16, k = 7); aggression (r =.24, k = 10); identification (r =.21, k = 30); relative group deprivation (r =.19, k = 11); realistic threat (r =.30, k = 27); symbolic threat (r =.28, k = 10); negative intergroup emotions (r =.25, k = 9); experiences of discrimination (r =.11, k = 12); dissatisfaction with the police, political actors, and institutions (r =.11, k = 32); and negative attitudes toward democracy (r =.17, k = 10). No significant effect was found for self-esteem, intolerance of uncertainty, narcissism, or exposure to intergroup conflict. The reviewed longitudinal and intervention studies mainly confirm these cross-sectional results. The script and our data are available in an open online repository. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The study explores how nationality and gender effect attitudes on the presence, use, and misuse of guns by security forces and civilians in Israel. Using data from a national survey (n = 721), we find that Israelis, Jews, and Arabs have more positive attitudes toward military firearms than civilian gun carry. The vast majority agree that display of military arms increases the public sense of security. Numbers are much lower regarding civilian carry. Most respondents, Jews and Arabs, would interfere if witnessed public misuse of firearms. An intersectional analysis finds (1) a gender gap, men have higher odds of reporting a firearm in the household than women; (2) Jews have more positive attitudes toward firearms than Arabs; (3) Jewish men have more positive attitudes toward civilian carry than Jewish women. This gender gap does not appear among Arabs; (4) Jews are more favorable of self-protection as a justification to use arms than Arabs. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies are divisive issues in American politics. These attitudes are influenced by factors such as political orientation and religiousness, with religious and conservative individuals demonstrating higher prejudice toward immigrants and refugees, and endorsing stricter immigration policies. Christian nationalism, an ideology marked by the belief that America is a Christian nation, may help explain how religious nationalist identity influences negative attitudes toward immigrants. The current research addresses this through four studies among participants in the US. Across studies, our results showed that Christian nationalism was a significant and consistent predictor of anti-immigrant stereotypes, prejudice, dehumanization, and support for anti-immigrant policies. These effects were robust to inclusion of other sources of anti-immigrant attitudes, including religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and political ideology. Further, perceived threats from immigrants mediated the relationship between Christian nationalism and dehumanization of immigrants, and attitudes toward immigration policies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relations between religious nationalism and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy in the US, as well as in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this article, we build on qualitative data from 37 in-depth interviews with Venezuelan immigrants in Chile, collected in 2017 and 2018, to explore how they make sense of sudden immigration policy changes made by the Sebastián Piñera government in mid-2018. Linked to these perceptions, we explore our interviewees’ attitudes towards other immigrant groups. We contend that, while immigrant participation in policymaking often is a normatively desired form of inclusion, immigrant perceptions of other immigrants and of immigration policy are not uniform. We find that immigrants can have very negative perceptions of other immigrants, favouring restrictive policies. Immigrants influence the contexts of reception for newcomers, and—in the case of Chile—they have voting and political rights that places them in a position of casting some influence over immigration policies. Studying the Venezuelan case is particularly illuminating, as this immigration was considered a desirable or acceptable immigration. © 2021 The Authors. International Migration © 2021 IOM

AB  - Metadehumanization, the perception that members of an outgroup dehumanize your group, has been found to exacerbate intergroup conflict by inspiring reciprocal dehumanization of the offending outgroup. Moreover, metadehumanization is distinct from metaprejudice (i.e., the perception that an outgroup hates your group). Given the mutual animosity reported in public opinion polls toward the other side, we believed US–Russia relations would be a worthwhile context in which to extend this model. Therefore, we measured Americans’ levels of metadehumanization and metaprejudice of Russians to determine the association between these perceptions and their hostility toward Russians (Study 1). In this novel intergroup conflict, metadehumanization remained a consequential predictor of outgroup hostility over and above metaprejudice, suggesting that it can exacerbate a broader range of intergroup conflicts than those heretofore examined. Given these findings, we then sought to experimentally differentiate between metadehumanization and metaprejudice. In Study 2, we manipulated both metadehumanization and metaprejudice to (a) determine whether one or both cause greater outgroup hostility and (b) elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which they may produce this effect. Whereas metadehumanization produced greater hostility, metaprejudice did not. Moreover, although both metaperceptions inspired greater prejudice, only metadehumanization led to greater dehumanization. We conclude that metadehumanization may be a particularly potent fomenter of hostility because it inspires reciprocal dehumanization over and above more general negative bias. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Ethnic minority representation lacks in research. Understanding factors that promote minorities in research helps address this participation gap. Minorities often face representation disparities, including health education, socioeconomic status, and race. Compared to other races in the USA, over 50% of African Americans (AA) over age 65 face obstacles towards achieving basic health literacy skills. This study aims to investigate differences in beliefs regarding research and health literacy between White and AA participants. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared 46 AA vs. 60 White healthy older adults (n = 106; age = 73.97 ± 10.6 years). Participants were assessed once with the Participant Attitudes and Beliefs towards Research Questionnaire (PABRQ) and two validated health literacy measures, the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and the Short Test of Functional Health Literacy for Adults (S-TOFHLA). Results: Controlling for age, sex, and education, AA performed significantly worse on REALM. Compared to White participants, AA more likely believed that researchers were motivated to perform studies to increase their general knowledge. Participants with lower health literacy scores more likely believed that scientists were motivated to conduct research to minimize treatment expenses. About 83–85% of participants reported not being familiar with the informed consent process, 90–95% had positive attitudes towards research involvement, and 38–52% believed researchers performed to promote their own careers. Conclusion: This work helps link older adults’ beliefs towards research, health literacy, and their participation in research. Future research is needed to remove barriers to participation in research for underserved, older adults. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.

AB  - Important health information including disease prevention and chronic disease self-management is increasingly packaged for digital use. The purpose of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study was to describe the extent of computer ownership, Internet access, and digital health information use in an ethnically diverse sample of older adults, comparing ownership, access, and use of digital health information (DHI) across ethnic groups and identifying the factors associated with them quantitatively. Significant differences in computer ownership, Internet access, and DHI use were found across ethnic groups (African American, Afro-Caribbean, Hispanic American, and European American). Logistic regression identified older age, less education, lower income, and minority group membership as significant predictors of limited DHI use. Older African Americans were one-fifth as likely to own a computer than were European Americans; Hispanic Americans were one-half as likely to have access to the Internet. We then conducted a series of focus groups which highlighted differences across ethnic groups. Participants in the African American/Afro-Caribbean group expressed frustration with lack of access to DHI but appreciation for alternative sources of information. Hispanic Americans critiqued information received from providers and drug inserts, some suggesting that a positive attitude and trust in God also contributed to getting well. European American participants evaluated various DHI websites, looking to providers for help in applying information to their personal situation. As the development and use of DHI continue, parallel efforts to increase access to DHI among economically disadvantaged and minority older adults are critical to prevent further disfranchisement. © 2021, W.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens’ attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self–group distancing coping strategy in terms of an “ironic” procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat “dark side” of procedural fairness. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Although it is known that collective narcissism is associated with problematic intergroup relations, its predictors are less well understood. Two studies, conducted in four European Union countries (Germany, Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom [UK]), tested the hypotheses that integrated (i.e., realistic and symbolic) threat (Study 1, N = 936) as well as distinctiveness threat (Study 2, N = 434) positively predict national collective narcissism and national ingroup satisfaction, but that only national collective narcissism predicts problematic intergroup relations in reference to threatening outgroups. The results were consistent with those hypotheses. The two types of threat predicted increased national collective narcissism and national ingroup satisfaction. However, only national collective narcissism was associated with negative emotions and hostile behavioral intentions toward the threatening outgroups, when its overlap with national ingroup satisfaction was partialled out. These cross-national findings advanced knowledge of predictors, as well as consequences, of collective narcissism. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The work is on the influence of socioeconomic status of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) on their anthropometry, nutrition knowledge, and attitude, attending special treatment center (STC) in National Hospital Abuja, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study design was carried out in the STC and a total of two hundred and seventy [270 (150 men and 120 women)] PLWHA were used for the study. The PLWHA attend STC once in 2 months and subjects were grouped into 16 giving 4 groups per week since the center runs Monday through Thursday weekly and by 2 months, there were altogether 32 groups. Socioeconomic characteristics, nutrition knowledge and attitude, and anthropometric data were collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square, and regression analysis. The study revealed that 41.1% of PLWHA had poor knowledge of nutrition, 29.1% had both fair and good knowledge while 0.7% had excellent knowledge. A total of 52.8% had a positive attitude toward nutrition. The skinfold status of the respondents showed that 56.0% were malnourished, while their body mass index (BMI) revealed that 49.3% were normal. Gender (being female) and age (being young) had a significant (P < 0.01) influence on the BMI of PLWHA, while being female significantly influenced their skinfold status. Self-employed and being female were strongest (P < 0.01) positive predictors of nutrition knowledge, while low education had a negative influence on their attitude toward nutrition. Good nutrition knowledge, attitude, and improved socioeconomic characteristics are important tools in the care process of PLWHA, for sustainable healthy PLWHA, leading to a healthy society at large.

AB  - There has been a lively debate about the economic and cultural-based drivers of support for populism. This article argues that economic concerns matter, but that they are realized through the relative gains and losses of social groups. Using new survey items in a large representative survey administered in Britain, it shows that citizens' economic assessments of the ethnic minority out-group - in relation to the group's situation 12 months ago and to assessments of the economic conditions of the white British in-group - are a predictor of support for Brexit. The results, which are robust to prior referendum vote, immigration attitudes and cultural sentiment, extend across income groups and national identity strength. Extending the analysis to a comparison of geographic in- and out-groups between local communities and London lends additional support to the argument. The implications of relative group-based economics are important for understanding Brexit and the economic sources of support for populism more broadly. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - From the lens of two Macanese publics, this study rethinks cosmopolitanism as a diverse identity and pursuit that can vary from one individual to another. It complicates what we know about polyglot Asian publics often profiled as 'cosmopolitan' for their foreign education, middle-class status, social commitment, and internationalist visions. I argue that, while these subjects shared a common background, they diverged according to shifting global contexts, generational differences, and personal experience. On a par with imagining themselves as part of a global community, cosmopolitan publics navigated between personal worlds and communal networks, as well as between a narrower nationalist and/or urban context and a broader global framework. My first subject, Macao-born Lourenço Pereira Marques, saw Hong Kong as a liberal ground to disseminate Darwinism across southern China's Lusophone public sphere during the 1880s, whereas Hong Kong-born José Pedro Braga worked to preach an internationalist vision of racial equality through a wider Anglophone public sphere and an emerging transnational associational culture in the early twentieth century. This study also aims to further our understanding regarding Hong Kong as a vibrant port city and explore the diversity of cosmopolitan publics in the context of transitioning internal and external worlds.

AB  - Social rejection during school years is a painful experience that has long-term effects, including development of negative attitudes toward minorities. Since social rejection is a complex experience, its effect in adulthood may be related to various background characteristics. The purpose of this study is to examine whether the effect of social rejection on negative attitudes toward minority groups in adulthood is related to group dominance and level of religiosity. Using a quantitative method, we administered a questionnaire that tested attitudes of 300 Israeli-born Jewish young people regarding Israeli Arabs and Jews of Ethiopian descent. In accordance with the hypotheses, social rejection was found as a predictor of negative attitudes toward minority groups only among members of the dominant group and those with high level of religiosity. The findings of the current study contribute to Social Dominance Theory and to the literature dealing with double marginality, since they demonstrate for the first time that social rejection at school combined with belonging to a dominant group (men and/or individuals of European descent) predicts a rejection of minority groups. However, social rejection at school combined with belonging to a non-dominant group (women and/or individuals of North African/Middle Eastern descent) predicts an acceptance of minority groups. Also, this research contributes to understanding the complex association between religiosity and prejudice, since it reveals that strong religious beliefs predict negative attitudes toward minority groups of the same religion only when they are combined with high level of social rejection at school. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) are foundational constructs in intergroup relations, yet their development across the lifespan is poorly understood. The few studies on the topic demonstrate that age positively correlates with both SDO and RWA. However, it is unclear whether this association is due to (a) normative aging, (b) generational differences associated with the period in which one was born and raised, or (c) a combination of these processes. This study estimates a series of cohort-sequential latent growth models to examine change due to both aging and cohort effects using 11 annual waves of longitudinal panel data collected from a nationwide random sample of adults (Ns = 61,858– 61,862). Mean levels of SDO and RWA both trended upward across the adult lifespan, although this pattern was more marked for RWA. Cohort effects also emerged for both constructs and were again more pronounced for RWA. Contextual factors thus appear to influence authoritarianism more than they impact the preference for intergroup hierarchy. Similar trends emerged when differentiating birth cohorts by gender and ethnic majority status. Age and cohort effects for generalized prejudice among an ethnic majority group were also assessed (N = 47,955), revealing that prejudice declined in early adulthood but began to stabilize in middle age. This is the first large-scale study to document how SDO, RWA, and generalized prejudice change over the adult lifespan while also examining trends associated with the period in which a person was born and socialized © 2022.

AB  - This paper examines how public support affects interest groups’ advocacy success across three distinct stages in the legislative process. We hypothesize that public support is vital for advocacy success when coalition agreements are negotiated, and it has a weaker effect when legislation is introduced in parliament by the governing majority but becomes stronger again when legislation is adopted. We assess these expectations for 55 Belgian policy issues. We combine evidence on legislative outcomes with public opinion data and a mapping of interest groups’ positions in the news. The results indicate that public support is key for advocacy success in the coalition agreement. However, the positive effect of public support weakens when legislation is introduced in parliament – the effect only materializes for initiatives by the opposition – and public support has no significant effect on advocacy success in adopted legislation. Instead, aligning with other groups and political parties becomes more consequential for advocacy success in later legislative stages. Still, on average, interest groups attaining their preferences in adopted legislation enjoy considerable public support. Our results thus underscore the relevance of distinguishing between legislative stages when analyzing interest groups’ advocacy success. © 2022 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Europe has recently seen a massive multi-ethnic influx of migrants, marred by high social costs of inter-ethnic confrontation. This has prompted scholars to develop training schemes to improve the social skills needed to cope with this situation. Decades of studies have acknowledged empathy as a crucial variable in the development of positive interpersonal and intergroup relations. In this study, we tested a training program for enhancing empathy towards ethnically diverse people in 170 six- to nine-year-old children. The materials were drawn from other best-known training schemes and active techniques were used. Multicultural empathy was assessed with a self-report measure. Test, retest and follow-up (at 6 months) comparisons demonstrated the training’s efficacy, with improvement in multicultural empathy persisting six months later. The results suggest that it can be a useful tool to encourage the development of ethnocultural empathy starting from the first years of elementary school. The practical implications for school education are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In a global community with increased immigration and rising sociocultural tensions, there is a need for psychometrically strong instruments that assess adjustment to increasingly culturally heterogeneous environments. The Multicultural Personality Inventory (MPI) is one such instrument, but previous studies have not reported the instrument’s invariance or item-level responses. The present study examined the psychometric properties of the MPI using item response theory, invariance analysis, and structural equation modeling with a sample of 1,194 participants. We found evidence for a 34-item instrument with a bifactor internal structure that demonstrated partial invariance across gender, race, and generational status. Evidence of concurrent and incremental validity of the MPI was established through predicted associations with acculturation, satisfaction with life, social dominance orientation, mental health, color-blind racial attitudes, and self-reported high school grade-point average, beyond any variance accounted for by Big Five variables. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Based on social psychological theories of intergroup relations, perceptions of threat from outgroups contribute to ingroup favoritism. This research examined the effects of the perceived threat from outgroups (the US) on Chinese people’s favorable evaluations of their government’s responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Study 1 conducted an experiment and found that the US’ criticism of China’s responses to the pandemic increased Chinese citizens’ favorable evaluations of the government’s performance. Study 2 was a correlational design and found that the relationship between perceptions of outgroup threats and evaluations of the government’s performance was moderated by ideology and the approval of lockdown policies. These results show that outgroups are sophisticatedly employed by politicians to increase ingroup favoritism and suggest that ideological divide is an important moderator in the association between outgroup threat and the evaluation of ingroup. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aimed to understand the behaviors of older adults in rural areas at all stages of active aging after participating in senior self-directed learning groups. This study adopted a qualitative research method and conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with six members of a senior learning center in a rural area. The themes identified from the thematic analysis were categorized into three levels: health, safety, and participation. The health level included (1) understanding the importance of exercise and taking the initiative in leading simple group exercises to develop regular exercise habits and (2) paying greater attention to disease and diet control through knowledge sharing with group members.The safety level included (1) paying more attention to safe driving when volunteering with other members; and (2) resonating with fall prevention techniques and cultivating a safe home to prevent falls. The participation level included (1) having more common topics to share with family members to enhance relationships (2) changing conceptualizations of interpersonal relationships and actively expanding and managing a circle of friends; and (3) increasing willingness to actively participate in social activities compared to before participating in the group. The results of this study showed that after joining the senior self-directed learning groups, the older adults had a positive change in their cognition of active aging, recognized the importance of active aging, and then faced their aging process with a positive attitude. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Cultural diversity in Hong Kong has increased dramatically following a series of reforms in population and immigration policies after the unification of Hong Kong in 1997. Since then, intergroup conflict between Hong Kong locals and mainland Chinese people have become one of the major social issues in Hong Kong. Homogenizing and overlooking intergroup clashes contribute to misunderstandings toward different cultures and resolving these clashes through social policies and services. Cultural research indicates that stereotyped beliefs are transmitted intergenerationally. Policy responses seek to nurture a harmonized society where perceived differences are respected and understood, rather than merely acknowledged. This study adopts narrative inquiry to examine the dynamics of acculturation, social identity, and intergroup contact among local and migrant parents and to explore the mechanisms for promoting positive acculturation amid diversity. We observed four parents from mainland China and three local Hong Kong parents with children aged 4–13 who attended two discussion sessions about parenting. The findings revealed that promoting positive acculturation via parent sharing support group is effective in promoting psychological adaptation at the individual level and reducing intergroup stereotypes at a cultural level. Conducive conditions that facilitate positive acculturation and professional group work practices are also discussed in this paper © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License

AB  - Exploring children's awareness of social categories could uncover the foundation of intergroup attitudes and behaviours. Indigenous to Ireland, Travellers are an ethnic minority marked by a tradition of nomadism, only formally recognised as a distinct ethnic group in 2017. This brief report analyses data from 148 children aged 6–12 (55% female) in the Republic of Ireland. A quantitative task was adapted and applied to assess children's awareness of symbols associated with the Traveller community. We found that primary school children could accurately categorise the symbols which relied on perceptually obvious markers of Traveller identity, and that this remained stable across middle childhood. However, children did not correctly categorise symbols related to less observable elements (e.g., language, trade, religion). To the best of our knowledge, these findings are the first to identify specific symbols which are salient in children's awareness about this marginalised group. Implications for school-based interventions are discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Multiple theoretical orientations propose a link between economic anxiety and racial attitudes. This article explores this link using three studies. The first study uses observational data from the 2016 CCES and ANES to determine whether or not anticipating a loss in income in the coming year is associated with negative racial affect. The second study uses observational data from the 2020 CCES to determine whether or not perceiving a greater risk of personal discrimination is associated with racial resentment. The last uses an original survey experiment from the 2020 CCES to gain insight into how priming intergroup competition shapes whites’ racial attitudes. These studies find an association between perceived economic threat and negative racial attitudes. However, the way respondents perceive economic threats seems to be largely shaped by partisan identification with Republicans perceiving greater levels of threat. They also suggest that material and symbolic threats may be mutually reinforcing. These findings support the claim that racial attitudes are deeply connected to economic anxieties and provide insight into how party identification shapes our psychology. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Islamist terrorist attacks and existing terror threat can seriously affect intergroup relations and policy making. Drawing on hostile media effect theory and intergroup threat theory, we hypothesized that perceived threat of terror influences perceived news media bias in favor of Muslims as well as support for surveillance policies that are perceived to be restrictive for Muslims. In addition, we assumed that media bias positively predicts surveillance policy support. Results of a quota-based two-wave panel survey (N T2 = 524) revealed that perceived threat of terror increased perceived media bias in favor of Muslims over time, but did not have a direct effect over time on support for surveillance policies. However, perceived media bias was found to be a positive predictor of support for surveillance policies over time. In addition, support for policies was a positive predictor of perceived terror threat over time, suggesting a vicious cycle. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Research on immigration attitudes focuses on two dimensions of exclusionary preferences: those related to achieved characteristics and those related to ascribed characteristics. First, we expand this work by unpacking how individuals blend attitudes across these two dimensions. Applying latent profile analysis to a comprehensive set of exclusionary indicators from the European Social Survey in 2002 and 2014, we observe seven attitudinal configurations: exclusionary, moderate individualistic, individualistic, tolerant, religious, illiberal liberalism, and racial capitalism. Second, using multinomial logistic regression with country fixed effects, we explore how configurations relate to a period where European countries experienced overall economic de-globalization, but more intensified cultural globalization. Consistent with integrated threat theories, we find that exclusionary views were less common in countries that became economically de-globalized. Conversely, we find no effect of cultural globalization on the growth or decline of the exclusionary configuration. We conclude by considering the policy implications of these results on current immigration policy. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Social psychological research on collective victimhood has often focused on comparisons between the ingroup's and outgroups' collective victimization (i.e. comparative victim beliefs such as competitive victimhood or inclusive victim beliefs). This qualitative study examines how people in different contexts of collective victimization and its aftermath make sense of items commonly used to assess comparative victim beliefs, and how they extend or challenge these constructs and their underlying assumptions. We used thematic analysis to analyse eight focus group discussions among four minority groups in the United States with historical or more recent experiences of collective victimization (Armenian Americans, Burundian refugees, Jewish Americans and Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees). Findings extend commonly assessed comparative victim beliefs and reveal participants' critical perspectives on these constructs. The findings also highlight the dialectical structure of collective victim beliefs: Participants not only endorsed but also rejected comparative victim beliefs, and relatedly described both ingroup power and outgroup power in the context of their group's victimization. These findings extend existing social psychological literature on comparative victim beliefs and intergroup relations. © 2022 British Psychological Society.

AB  - Why does group loyalty sometimes take the form of cooperation or peaceful competition with rival groups and, at other times, violent outgroup hostility? We approached this question using online surveys and an experimental manipulation with British soccer fans. Identity fusion (a visceral sense of “oneness” with the group) is known to motivate strong forms of pro-group action, both peaceful and violent. We identified three crucial factors that influence fused supporters’ intergroup behaviours: age, gender, and exposure to out-group threat. Intergroup behaviours included ingroup altruism (e.g., giving one’s time, or emotional/financial support), barrier-crossing altruism (altruistic acts toward rival fan groups), and outgroup hostility (e.g., insulting, spitting at, or physically attacking). Overall, fused fans were more hostile towards outgroups than were weakly fused fans, but they prioritised ingroup altruism over outgroup hostility, and were most likely to report high levels of barrier-crossing altruism. Older fused fans desired future outgroup hostility only under high threat conditions. A clearer understanding of the factors that modulate these different behaviours is a crucial first step in devising more effective ways of reducing intergroup hostility and, crucially, of channelling extreme forms of group alignment into peaceful forms of prosocial action. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: We examine the role of how a hostile discourse toward Islam influences American public opinion regarding U.S. foreign policy actions toward Muslim populations and Muslim-majority nations. Methods: Using a survey experiment with two vignettes, we test how Americans’ foreign policy preferences are affected by Islamic identity. In the first vignette, a minority group is facing ethnic cleansing. Second, a country is developing chemical weapons. Results: We find that Americans are less likely to see Muslim minorities abroad as under threat or to support costly foreign policy actions to assist them. We also find that Americans are more likely to see Muslim countries as threatening and to support the use of military force against Muslim states. Conclusion: Our evidence suggests that the political effects of Islamophobia are not restricted to domestic policy but include foreign policy preferences too. © 2022 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - Identity fusion is traditionally conceptualized as innately parochial, with fused actors motivated to commit acts of violence on out-groups. However, fusion’s aggressive outcomes are largely conditional on threat perception, with its effect on benign intergroup relationships underexplored. The present article outlines the fusion-secure base hypothesis, which argues that fusion may engender cooperative relationships with out-groups in the absence of out-group threat. Fusion is characterized by four principles, each of which allows a fused group to function as a secure base in which in-group members feel safe, agentic, and supported. This elicits a secure base schema, which increases the likelihood of fused actors interacting with out-groups and forming cooperative, reciprocal relationships. Out-group threat remains an important moderator, with its presence “flipping the switch” in fused actors and promoting a willingness to violently protect the group even at significant personal cost. Suggestions for future research are explored, including pathways to intergroup fusion. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - We explored how employed university students experience their relationships with their work colleagues and with non-employed students. Two research questions (RQs) were considered: RQ1: What experiences and conditions do employed students identify as contributing to a sense that they are a distinct and separate group from (1) their work colleagues and (2) non-employed students? RQ2: What experiences and conditions do employed students feel facilitate and/or inhibit their social adaptation and integration at work and university? We interviewed 21 part-time employed students in England, and analyzed the transcripts using reflexive thematic analysis. We adopted a deductive approach, using the Social Identity Approach as a theoretical framework. In relation to work colleagues, employed students identified a lack of empathy, being looked down upon, and experiencing hostility at the workplace as making them feel distinct from their work colleagues. In relation to non-employed students, employed students identified differences in experiences and values as increasing intergroup differentiation, which then resulted in feelings of not fitting in at university or social exclusion. Identified conditions, which supported social integration in the workplace, were working with colleagues who held positive attitudes toward students, experiencing similar workplace circumstances and a sense of common fate. Employed students felt socially integrated when non-workers had positive regard for them or by discussing their employment with other employed students. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The popular concept of “finding common ground” suggests that recognizing similarities, as opposed to differences, can lead to positive interactions among group members. This adage is supported by the literature on intergroup contact theory, with research indicating that a key pillar in mitigating intergroup bias is positive and meaningful intergroup contact. Similarity attraction theory suggests similar findings—primarily that individuals are attracted to those similar to themselves, which elicit positive affect in interpersonal interactions. This literature offers valuable insights for individualswho take part in interactions inwhich favorable outcomes are dependent on effective intergroup interaction, such as negotiation. While thorough research has been conducted on the benefits of similarity in interpersonal interactions, surprisingly little work has examined how perceptions of similarity affect one’s evaluations of a negotiation counterpart or the negotiation process when the negotiating counterpart is an out-group member. The present study tests the effect of focusing on similarities versus differences on attitudes toward a forthcoming negotiation and perceptions of the negotiation partner, and whether perceived similarity mediates the impact on attitudes toward the negotiation. Drawing from the research on imagined contact, we simulated a negotiation via vignette, gave U.S.-based participants (N = 530; female = 306, male = 223, nonbinary = 1) a writing task manipulation, and asked them to complete measures to assess similarity, perceptions of their negotiating counterpart’s intelligence, reluctance to compromise, and optimism toward negotiation. Results showed that focusing on similarities between oneself and one’s negotiation partner significantly improved attitudes toward the negotiation process, willingness to compromise, and perceptions of the other’s intelligence. Perceived similarity mediated the relationship between our manipulated writing task and both the participants’ willingness to compromise and their optimism toward the negotiation. Our findings add to the research on the effects of similarity salience in the specific context of negotiation settings and suggest that focusing on similarities with out-group members in negotiations presents practical benefits for conflict resolution processes © 2022.

AB  - Objectives: Ransomware attacks have become a critical security threat worldwide. However, existing research on ransomware has largely ignored public opinion. This initial study identifies patterns in the American public’s support for the use of ransomware, specifically when it is framed to provide benefits to others (i.e., in-group members). Drawing on the Robin Hood decision-making literature and Moral Foundations Theory, we offer theoretical predictions regarding ransomware support. Methods: In a survey of 1013 Americans, we embedded a split-ballot experiment in which respondents were randomly assigned to indicate their level of support or opposition to one of two sets of six ransomware scenarios. We manipulated the nationality, authority level, and political affiliation of the actors. Results: We find that people are more supportive of ransomware use when the actors are from their own in-group, and the outcomes benefit their in-group members. Also, the more strongly participants endorsed the moral foundations of authority and harm/care, the more supportive they were of the use of ransomware that may benefit others from their in-group. Conclusions: These findings suggest political actors may be able to generate public support for morally questionable actions by emphasizing in-group benefits and the Robin Hood nature of an attack (e.g., outcome-based morality). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Do perceptions of insecurity from politically motivated violence affect the decision of poor voters to re-elect incumbents in Indian elections? This article examines this question in the empirical context of the Maoist-affected Junglemahal region in the state of West Bengal in eastern India. Exploiting original survey data collected in 38 Maoist-affected villages in Junglemahal prior to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, I show that respondents (a) were able to discriminate between politically motivated violence and other governance-related issues, (b) were more inclined to vote for the incumbent the greater the importance attached to the provision of public goods, but (c) were less inclined to vote for the incumbent the greater the importance attached to politically motivated violence. In auxiliary tests, I find that the effect of the perceived threat from politically motivated violence was mediated by feelings of fear, anger, and worry about the general direction in which the state was going. I also present evidence showing a positive relationship between the level of campaign contact by the opposition party and the level of negative emotions experienced by voters. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper studies the roles of economic insecurity (EI) and attitudes to racial inequality as predictors of voting patterns in the 2016 US election. Using data from the 2016 Voter Survey, we show that both perceptions of EI and concerns over anti-White discrimination are significant correlates of Republican support. Effect sizes on racial attitudes are much larger than those found on EI, although the effects of insecurity become larger when accounting for both short-term and long-term economic stress. We also show there is very little heterogeneity in the effects of insecurity across racial groups—both Whites and minorities are more likely to vote Republican when experiencing short-term insecurity. Our results suggest that policies that mitigate micro-level economic risk may lessen support for populist political candidates. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that low social dominance orientation (social equality orientation) promotes empathy with disadvantaged group members. In three studies, we tested a model relating preference for egalitarianism to positive attitudes towards immigrants through emotional experiences (pride, guilt, moral anger/ anger, disgust). Studies 1 and 2 showed that social equality orientation was positively related to proimmigrant attitudes through increased pride in helping immigrants, controlling for participants’ gender, age, and political orientation. Such a preference for egalitarianism was unrelated to proimmigrant attitudes through guilt for not helping immigrants and moral anger concerning mistreatment of immigrants. By focusing on emotional experience concerning proimmigrant national initiatives (e.g., integrating immigrants into the labor market), Study 3 corroborated the indirect effect of social equality orientation on proimmigrant attitudes through increased pride, controlling for participants’ gender, age, political orientation, as well as competitive jungle and dangerous world beliefs. Although much weaker, we also found a positive association between social equality orientation and proimmigrant attitudes through reduced anger, while no significant association through guilt and disgust was found. Results suggest that, relative to guilt, anger, and disgust, pride is the key channel through which preference for egalitarianism is related to positive attitudes towards immigrants. Implications and future directions for research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As multiracial children of foreign-born parents, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama embody diversity in politics for many perceivers. Yet some have also questioned their loyalty to their respective groups. We explored perceptions of dual group members’ (DGM; dual nationals, multiracial people, and dual state residents) loyalty among first-party (those who share a group membership with a DGM target) and third-party perceivers (those who do not). Studies 1a–2b showed that first- and third-party perceivers rated DGMs as less loyal than their single group member (SGM) counterparts. However, only first- (Studies 2a–2b) but not third-party (Studies 1a–1b) perceivers preferred SGMs to DGMs for loyalty-dependent roles. Study 3 revealed that perceivers who were higher in patriotism supported DGMs for loyalty-dependent roles less when they were first- (vs. third) party observers. These studies suggest that perceivers readily intuit that DGMs are less loyal than SGMs and, under some conditions, this may lead to discrimination. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This research aims in developing an application for the waste management via the QR code system: 1) to study the quality of the application and 2) to study the satisfaction of users of the application by using the system development life cycle (SDLC) principle. There were 388 people of sample groups in this research which consisted of community leaders, village health volunteers, youth and the general public of Ban Yang Sub-district, Mueang Buriram District, and Buriram Province. The research instruments were the application for a waste management via the QR code system, Application Quality Assessment Form, and the application satisfaction questionnaire. The statistics used in the data analysis were mean and standard deviation. The results of the research revealed that there were three main functions of the application for a waste management via the QR code system as follows: 1) The quality assessment of the application in all aspects at a high level (Mean = 4.41, S.D.=0.10). 2) Study of satisfaction of the application users in all aspects at a high level (Mean = 4.42, S.D. = 0.45). 3) The application of waste management application via the QR code system allowed group members in the community to reduce the process of managing household waste more conveniently and create a positive attitude in using waste to elevate through the work of the group members in the community. © 2022.

AB  - Far-right politics has gained significant support across Europe in recent decades. Previous literature has investigated the conditions that lead to immigrants being perceived as “threats”, leading to increased support for anti-immigrant parties. However, how certain “shock events”–times of dramatic change–mobilize far-right support around anti-immigrant sentiment has been understudied. Drawing on social movement literature, I examine how support for anti-immigrant politics was driven by demographic change during the “refugee crisis” in Sweden. I use a unique dataset on Swedish municipalities (N = 290) between 2014 and 2018 to examine the relationship between immigration and far-right outcomes. I show that increases in Syrian immigrants during the “refugee crisis” led to significant gains in support for anti-immigrant politics at the municipal level. I suggest that the “refugee crisis” constituted a politicized ethno-racial shock that lead to increases in far-right support, as political actors seized on increased immigration to mobilize around threat perceptions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - “It's the economy stupid”—is the phrase that captures the ubiquity of economics in determining election outcomes. Nevertheless, while several studies support the premise of economic voting, a constant critique of valence economic models is that partisan bias contaminates voters' economic perceptions, thus invaliding any independent effect of economic opinions on the vote. Here, we test whether partisanship may itself be endogenous to the macroeconomy. Aggregating data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES), supplemented with European Social Survey (ESS) data to bolster the time analysis, we focus on macropartisanship and find a drop-off of party identifiers for governing parties in tandem with the economic downturn, specifically from rising unemployment. More generally, macropartisanship responds to economic conditions, suggesting that the endogeneity concern between party attachment and valence economic conditions is not unidirectional. That is, while economic perceptions may be influenced by party identification, party identification can be influenced by economic conditions.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests medical and social models of disability, or sets of assumptions regarding the cause and treatment of disability, and contact with people with disabilities, influence attitudes about people with disabilities. This study tests disability models and contact as an avenue for disability attitude intervention. Three psychology undergraduate classes were examined. Education + contact focused on social construction of disability, challenged the medical model, and was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 52). Contact did not include disability content but was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 45). Control did not include disability content and was taught by an instructor without a disability (n = 53). Participants completed measures of disability models and attitudes at the beginning and end of each 10-week course. Results showed medical model beliefs were associated with negative attitudes while social model beliefs were associated with positive attitudes. Participants in the education + contact group reported greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs, and greater reductions in medical model beliefs at posttest than participants in the contact or control groups. The contact group also showed greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs and greater reductions in medical model beliefs compared to the control group. Change in medical model beliefs mediated the relationship between course and attitude change. This is the first study to demonstrate that disability models can be intervened upon and can explain disability attitude change. Such interventions may prepare psychology students to interact with this large minority group. © 2020. American Psychological Association

AB  - This study explores children’s responses to animated, ficational characters when honesty is put to the test through behaviors of racialized, peer-like media characters. Children (n = 178, aged 8–13 years) viewed an episode of a popular U.S. television program, Nickelodeon’s The Loud House, with a dishonest White character (Lincoln) or an honest Black character (Clyde). The findings confirm that Clyde who is portrayed as honest is seen as more honest, higher in morality, and liked more than Lincoln who deliberately lies. Race did not impact how much children like the White character (Lincoln), but Black children reported liking the Black character (Clyde) more than White children. Children who have previously seen the show are more likely to like and have a stronger parasocial relationship with the characters, with a regression pinpointing this is most important for Lincoln, the White character. The main finding that the regression analyses tease out is that it is the parasocial relationship that is significantly positively related to how likable and moral the children rate the characters, not race and racial attitudes. Implications are discussed within a context of mediated contact, social construction of identity and groups, and moral judgements. IMPACT SUMMARY a.Prior State of Knowledge: Previous research suggests that youth can learn moral behaviors from media characters. However, few television studies with youth have examined character honesty and race in a research investigation. b.Novel Contributions. Children who feel emotionally connected to a media character can be more accepting of problematic behavior of the character. Racial bias and preferences for Black or White media characters indicate that racial awareness is salient for youth. c.Practical Implications. Children’s relationships with media characters can have implications on their learning about consequences of moral behaviors. Practitioners should be thoughtful in their representations of characters, particularly children of color, reaching for more positive portrayals of children of color as a means to mitigate judgment of others and enhance interracial relationships. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objectives: Using the Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework, we investigated the association between attitudes towards COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy and change in these variables over a 9-month period in a UK cohort. Methods: The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results: Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions: Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - College students from underrepresented racial groups often experience racial prejudice and discrimination from their White peers at predominantly White institutions (PWIs). White university students may be misinformed about race and unaware of their privilege. In this study, we investigated the effects of online training that aimed to increase participants' cultural competence through multicultural knowledge, awareness of their own privilege, and skills. White college students at a PWI completed a 4-week training program adapted from a 1-day in-person workshop. The training provided 1-h weekly online sessions in which White participants (n = 72) were provided resources aimed to develop cultural competence. It utilized student-acted role plays, reflection questions, articles, and videos to create an interactive experience for students. Results demonstrated that participants showed significant increases in cultural competence and acknowledgment of their White privilege directly following the fourth training session. Further, they exhibited decreases in racial colorblindness. This study suggests that a brief, online training may increase cultural competence in undergraduates which can potentially improve the climates of university campuses. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Ingroup bias is often treated as the default outcome of intergroup comparisons. We argue that the mechanisms of impression formation depend on what information people infer from groups. We differentiate between belief-indicative groups that are more informative of beliefs and affect attitudes through ingroup bias and status-indicative groups that are more informative of status and affect attitudes through a preference for higher status. In a cross-cultural factorial experiment (Ntotal = 1,281), we demonstrate that when information about targets’ multiple group memberships is available, belief-indicative groups affect attitudes via ingroup bias, whereas status-indicative groups—via preference for higher status. These effects were moderated by social-structural context. In two follow-up studies (Ntotal = 451), we develop and validate a measure of belief- and status-indicativeness (BISI) of groups. BISI showed expected correlations with related constructs of entitativity and essentialism. Belief-indicativeness of groups was a better predictor of ingroup bias than entitativity and essentialism. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - In times of emergent emphases on how climate change will affect welfare societies, welfare policies and individuals’ welfare and vice versa, this study investigates public support for welfare and environmental policies and concerns. Since previous research and literature have pointed towards a socioeconomic divide between the welfare agenda and the environmental agenda in terms of public support, this article makes a thorough socioeconomic analysis of public welfare and environmental attitudes. The article analyses data from an original study in the context of Sweden (n = 1529). Through multinomial logistic regression analysis this study investigates if and which socioeconomic factors increase the likelihood of expressing mutual support for welfare and environmental policies and concerns compared to expressing support for welfare or environmental policies and concerns in isolation, as well as no support at all. The results indicate that both low and high socioeconomic status factors increase the likelihood of expressing mutual welfare and environmental support. These factors are low - to middle-range income levels, high educational attainment and low - to high-status occupations. Accordingly, this study finds that individuals expressing mutual welfare and environmental support are less easily placed in the low to high socioeconomic continuum. This suggests that we need to go beyond the two established theoretical perspectives of self-interest and personal capabilities when explaining mutual welfare and environmental support and, for example, direct the attention to factors and theoretical points of departure that take post-materialism and non-economic dimensions into account. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - With the increasing ethnic diversity in school classrooms globally, understanding how best to harness intergroup contact and promote social cohesion is a timely challenge for science, policy, and practice alike. There is an urgent need, therefore, for applied social psychological research that bridges theory and practice in the pursuit of peace. The present article reflects on the process of working with teachers in ethnically diverse secondary schools in England to coproduce an intervention that aimed to promote better intergroup relations among 11-year-old school students. Through a series of workshops, we cocreated a theoretically informed intervention that was then implemented and evaluated in schools. In this article, we discuss our approach to the development of our intervention. We then conduct a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats analysis of our research process and approach to coproduction and offer recommendations for researchers aiming to carry out applied research in the pursuit of peace. The appropriateness of social psychological frameworks for promoting intergroup relations, and in turn, peace in real-world contexts and implications for future research and practice are discussed. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Hate crime legislation is a divisive issue in America. While many Americans agree that hate crime laws are necessary, roughly one-third of Americans do not support such legislation. Some research suggests that one reason for this variation in support may be differences in political attitudes. Other research suggests that variation in support may be attributable to differences in prejudicial attitudes toward those minority groups that hate crime laws are intended to protect. Importantly, however, prior research has also indicated a relationship between political affiliation and prejudice, yet research has not considered the potential for there to be a joint relationship between prejudice, political affiliation, and hate crime law support. Following this, the current research examined these relationships using data from 1,935 survey respondents across the United States who voted in the 2016 election, shared who they voted for, and expressed opinions regarding hate crime laws. Our results indicated at least three important findings. First, we found that political attitudes were uniquely associated with hate crime law support, such that more conservative voters were less likely to support hate crime laws. Second, indicators of anti-Hispanic, anti-Asian, and anti-Black prejudice were each negatively associated with hate crime law support. Finally, each of these prejudicial attitude measures significantly mediated the association between political affiliation and hate crime law support. These results suggest that politically conservative resistance to these laws may be partially rooted in prejudicial attitudes. By understanding these patterns, this research can inform important policy debates surrounding these issues moving forward. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Outgroup perceptions are a fundamental element of social categorization, particularly in contexts of intergroup conflict. Social Identity Development Theory argues that perceived differences between groups is the first step in ethnic identity development. This understanding of social categories among children may have implications for negative intergroup attitudes or even prejudice. Our study explores how Jews (N = 180) and Arab-Muslims (N = 207) in middle childhood perceive the difference between these two ethno-religious groups in Israel. Thematic analysis found two themes: (a) differences in everyday ethnic and cultural properties and (b) differences related to religion.

AB  - The 20th century saw the dismantling of several oppressive regimes and an international turn toward greater social justice. Yet structural inequality and intergroup animosity persist in many postcolonial and postslavery contexts, not least because the dehumanization inherent to those regimes remain entrenched socially. Here we examined whether the racialized hierarchy established under the inhumane South African apartheid system is still manifest in patterns of dehumanization today, and how this impacts intergroup relations and behaviors related to structural reform. Specifically, we investigated blatant dehumanization as the explicit attribution of reduced human uniqueness, factors contributing to its tenacity, and its intergroup outcomes in a national sample of the three largest racialized groups: Black African,Coloured, andWhite.We found that, despite significant changes in power dynamics postapartheid, dehumanization ratings mirrored the apartheid-inspired hierarchy, with White people rated “more human” than Coloured people, and Coloured people rated “more human” than Black African people across participants. Levels of dehumanization were ameliorated by positive intergroup contact and reinforced by feeling dehumanized (meta-dehumanization) and hierarchy-legitimizing beliefs in White and Coloured participants. Finally, White participants’ dehumanization of Black African people predicted, beyond prejudice, several outcomes (social distance, collective action, and petition support) that would sustain the unequal status quo. Our results suggest that intergroup dynamics are influenced by the positions people occupied on the apartheid racial hierarchy, and that curbing dehumanization should be prioritized to advance structural reform in South Africa. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - In the recent years, research on the conditions, under which members of the host countries such as Germany perceive refugees as threatening and respond with negative attitudes, has increased. However, little attention has been given to the implications that subjective perceptions of threat among the host community may have for their own psychological health. Using integrated threat theory, the current study examined the relationships between perceived threats, person-centered antecedents in intercultural settings, and psychological distress among Germans, who reflected on incoming refugees. Using a survey company, a sample (N = 1000) was recruited, which matched the German census regarding central demographics. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey with validated self-report measures. Assessments covered four perceived threat types (intergroup anxiety, symbolic and realistic threat, negative stereotypes), person-related antecedents (social identity as German, quantity and quality of prior intercultural contact), and psychological distress. Applying structural equation modeling, we found that high social identification as German was related to greater perceptions of symbolic/realistic threat, stronger negative stereotypes and to more intergroup anxiety. Vice versa, high quality of prior intercultural contact experiences was associated with a decrease of all threat types. The quantity of prior intercultural contact showed almost no relations to perceived threats. In terms of indirect effects, greater quality of contact predicted less distress, and greater identity as German predicted more distress, both via symbolic/realistic threat and intergroup anxiety. Taken together, perceiving refugees as a threatening outgroup may signify a self-harming risk, while high quality of intercultural relations may indirectly enhance health. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - As the US-China great power competition intensifies, public opinion polling may help gauge internal drivers of foreign policy decision-making. Using Pew Research Center data, the authors analyzed how American and Chinese respondents viewed their own and each other’s countries between 2008–2016. They further examined how American attitudes towards China varied by political affiliation between 2008–2019. Both Americans and the Chinese displayed ingroup bias (i.e. rating their own country more positively than the other) and viewed China as a challenger to US hegemony. However, while the Chinese exhibited higher levels of ingroup bias overall, there was no evidence of increasing bias over time. Meanwhile, Americans showed increasing ingroup bias, primarily due to their souring evaluations of China, a tendency that was strongest among Republicans. © 2022 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

AB  - Little is known about whether the benefits of intergroup contact extend to contexts (e.g., a diverse underdeveloped township) likely to prove demanding for improved intergroup relations. There is a need for further research in these contexts on the potential inhibitors of contact (such as diversity and threat) and their effects. Perceived social diversity has been implicated in the deterioration of intergroup relations. This is particularly salient in the context of immigrant relations, where anti-immigrant sentiments are characterized by perceived threat and lower outgroup trust. Diversity can, however, have an indirect positive effect on outgroup attitudes, via intergroup contact, which reliably predicts lower perceived threat and prejudice. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that empathy could mitigate negative attitudes towards immigrants. We investigated the relationship between perceived neighbourhood diversity, cross-group friendships, realistic and symbolic threat, empathic responding, trust, and outgroup orientation within the volatile context of Black (African) South Africans’ relations with African immigrants. Survey data were collected from South Africans (N = 317) living in a township. Structural equation modelling showed that perceived diversity was significantly positively associated with both realistic threat (which was significantly negatively associated with outgroup trust) and cross-group friendships (which was significantly negatively associated with realistic threat). There was a significant indirect association between cross-group friendships and positive orientation towards African immigrants via empathic responding towards African immigrants. These findings suggest that cross-group friendships and empathy might mitigate the negative impact of diversity and threat on attitudes towards immigrants, even in this demanding context. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In an increasingly diverse world, understanding young adults’ intergroup prosocial behavior toward diverse others may inform ways to reduce intergroup conflict and cultivate an equitable and inclusive society. The college years are often the first time that young adults begin to explore their social identities and intergroup relations independently from their parents. Thus, we focused on college students and examined social dominance orientation, social positions, prosocial obligation, and the sense of belongingness in relation to their intergroup prosocial behavior across four domains (i.e., age, gender, race/ethnicity, and department affiliation). Participants were 1163 young adults aged 18–24 years (63.2% females, 34.5% males, and 2.3% gender diverse; 50.7% White, 19.6% Latino, 25% Asian, 2.3% Black) from a large public Southwestern university. Four profiles of intergroup prosocial behavior (self-serving, altruistic, selfish, and reverse ethnic racial bias) were identified and they were differentially related to the social, cognitive, and contextual correlates we examined. Overall, findings highlighted the need to foster intergroup prosocial behavior and the benefits of intergroup prosocial behavior to young adults’ sense of belongingness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Hostile attitudes toward refugees are on the rise, yet individuals who hold negative beliefs toward out-groups are the most difficult to persuade. Is an explicit persuasive appeal effective for such groups, or should fictional narratives with implicit messages be used instead? An online experiment (N = 1, 749) was conducted to test this possibility with three possible media-based interventions: a fictional sympathetic portrayal, a fictional hostile portrayal, or a documentary-based portrayal. Hostile portrayals increased negative attitudes toward refugees, while documentary portrayals increased positive attitudes and promoted stereotype reversal. These effects were observed regardless of nationalism or social dominance orientation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This preregistered research analyzed survey data from ethnic and religious advantaged groups in 12 countries (N = 2,304) to examine the interplay between two determinants of support for social change toward intergroup equality. Drawing on the needs-based model and the common-ingroup identity model, we hypothesized that the experience of accepting intergroup contact and the endorsement of a dual identity representation of intergroup relations would be associated with greater support for equality. Furthermore, integrating the logic of both models, we tested the novel hypothesis that the positive effect of accepting contact on support for equality would be stronger under a high (vs. low) dual identity representation. While the predicted main effects received empirical support, we found no evidence for the expected interaction. These findings suggest that interventions to foster support for social change among advantaged group members can promote accepting contact and a dual identity representation independently of each other. © 2022 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - How do racial group attitudes shape the political preferences of Black and white evangelicals? Scholarship has documented the relationship between religion and race in shaping political behavior and attitudes. However, less is known about how in-group and out-group racial attitudes operate within religious populations. Using samples of Black and white evangelicals from the 2012 and 2016 American National Election Studies, we explore the role of racial identity centrality and racial resentment in determining evangelicals' political preferences. While the role of Black and white identity among evangelicals is minimal, we find strong and consistent conservatizing effects for racial resentment. Together these findings suggest that the evangelical racial divide is not driven by Black evangelicals' attachment to their racial identity, but that racial resentment may drive white evangelicals to more conservative political preferences.

AB  - Ukraine is existential to Russia, but peripheral to American interests. The “escalation dominance” advantage is with Moscow, and no amount of military aid or economic coercion, short of an actual war, will deter Moscow, given the asymmetry of interests and differing threat perceptions. American public opinion remains firmly opposed to risking a potential great power war. That said, a Ukraine—if it exists as a state after the war—at peace with its neighbours is in everyone’s interest, as is a decreased risk of a great power conflict. This policy brief identifies some confidence-building measures that might, in a similar situation in the future, result in a more realist grand bargain. A potential war might be a short punitive campaign by Russia, in which case the central thesis of this policy brief, a neutral zone in Ukraine, will remain intact. It might also be a war of occupation and conquest, in which case this paper might be considered a study in a counterfactual history of what could have been. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Although only 23 people on average have been killed per year by terrorist attacks in the United States since 2001, American citizens and politicians consistently rank terrorism as a top security threat, leading to costly wars abroad and the repression of civil liberties at home. To what extent can education about terrorism alter perceptions of the threat? Much existing scholarship—and consistent polling over the past two decades—suggests that it cannot, but we disagree. Evidence gathered from an extensive series of experimental and observational surveys involving students in 31 terrorism and non-terrorism related courses at 12 universities—including massive open online courses (MOOC) and online surveys—reveals that the more individuals learn about terrorism, the smaller they perceive the threat to be to themselves and to the U.S. In the fight against terrorism and the fear it inspires, knowing really is half the battle. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - While there is extensive literature about public concern about climate change, most studies rely on cross-sectional static data. Based on a unique panel survey conducted in nine European countries in 2018 and 2019, we make a rare investigation of factors that explain why some young people (age: 18–34 years) are, have become or have lost their concern about climate and environmental issues at times of widespread discussions about the climate emergency. The analysis tests argument about the importance of individual-level factors such as values and political orientations and consider the role of cross-national variations, the experience of extreme weather events and youth-led climate strikes. Our results support prior studies as we find that young people with libertarian rather than authoritarian values, with more positive views towards immigration and redistribution policies, tend to be more concerned about climate change and the environment. We find little effect of contextual factors. Young people who have experienced economic hardship and have a right-wing political orientation are less likely to become concerned for climate and environmental issues. Socio-economic conditions, values and political orientations are crucial to understanding climate concern among young Europeans, affecting youth climate engagement at times of increasing inequalities and polarization. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Baltic presidents have in common that they are supposed to embody the ‘nation’ and provide an image of their countries abroad. But can the president embody the people if ‘the people’ itself is divided? In this article, we will focus on public trust in the presidency between the majority and minority population in the Baltic states. Drawing on public opinion surveys, the aim is to examine the determinants of public trust in the presidential institution and support for the performance and principles of the political system as well identification with the political community itself. Among our findings, we conclude that ethnic or linguistic identity explains trust to a considerable degree, which suggests that trust is not only an expression of specific political support, but also part of a more deep-seated, diffuse support. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - We propose that support for group-based hierarchy among members of low-status or subordinate groups may be boosted by beliefs in future ingroup high status. Specifically, the more individuals believe their group may hold a higher status, the more they support hierarchical intergroup relations (i.e., high social dominance orientation; SDO), by boosting ingroup favouritism. In turn, SDO should be positively associated with collective action tendencies by increasing social competition intentions. Using samples from Catalonia (N = 152) and the Basque Country (N = 262), results showed that independence supporters’ beliefs in future ingroup status enhancement reinforced participants’ SDO, through nationalist sentiments (i.e., ingroup bias) but not through patriotism in the Catalan sample, and directly in the Basque sample. In turn, SDO increased collective actions towards independence by reinforcing individuals’ motivation to compete with the opponent dominant outgroup (Madrid region), especially in the Catalan sample. We discuss the implications of considering situational and contextual factors to better understand individuals’ support for group-based hierarchies and inequality. © 2022 Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje.

AB  - Those studying criminal justice at the undergraduate level are an important bellwether for understanding future reform efforts. If students are unwilling to acknowledge systemic issues needing reform, this suggests that reform efforts are likely to face internal opposition. The current study examines the extent to which criminal justice students acknowledge that systemic racial issues present a need for criminal justice reform. Using survey data from students at a single university, the findings reveal that students are willing to acknowledge the existence of systemic racism, although expected individual-level factors predicted variation in such acknowledgment. In addition, the current study explores the relationship between willingness to acknowledge systemic issues and general punitive attitudes. Consistent with the extant research, criminal justice students’ racialized attitudes are significantly related to more punitive crime-control preferences. These findings have implications for understanding efforts to reform criminal justice, and they raise essential questions for criminal justice educators. © 2022 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.

AB  - This study explores shifts in political trust during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and threat perceptions played in individuals’ trust in politics. We combine panel surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat perceptions. The paper therefore advances our understanding of the nuanced nature of media effects, particularly as relates to alternative media, especially during moments of crisis. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Considering the current political relevance of anti-immigration sentiments, we examined preference to avoid interacting with immigrants–conceptualized here as a manifestation of xenophobia–among radical (Sweden Democrats, Sverigedemokraterna, N = 2216) and mainstream (Conservative Party, Moderaterna, N = 634) right-wing voters in Sweden. Correlates of xenophobia did not differ between the voter groups or compared to other populations in previous research, suggesting that increased societal focus on immigration has not altered the correlation patterns. Intended Sweden Democrat (vs. Conservative Party) voting correlated with Right-Wing Authoritarianism, institutional distrust, less right-leaning socioeconomic attitudes (in both low- and high-xenophobia subgroups), sexist attitudes (low-xenophobia subgroup), male gender and younger age (high-xenophobia subgroup). In both voter groups, respondents with higher xenophobia expressed on average more sympathy for the Sweden Democrats, perhaps indicating a larger potential voter base. We discuss the interplay of xenophobia and contemporary voting behaviours, and the concept of xenophobia in relation to anti-immigration attitudes. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The study extends the approach of the Stereotype Content Model to ethnic stereotype content beyond intergroup relations within societies by exploring the North-South hypothesis for competence and warmth. This paper claims that the “desperate” (resource-poor and unpredictable) of lower-latitude climate regions and “hopeful” (resource-sufficient and stable) ecology higher-latitude climate regions translate into typical aggregate attributes and are afterward generalized to the status of all their residents. Further, people use this information as a diagnostic for judgments about the economic value or burden of ethnic groups in their society. Based on the data about aggregated means of competence and warmth for 77 ethnic groups in 38 regions, the multivariate models show that ethnic groups from warmer climates and from lower wealth countries are given lower evaluation in both competence and warmth stereotypes. However, ethnic groups from more northerly countries are also given a lower evaluation in warmth. Ethnic stereotypes reflect both features of ethnic groups in countries of origin (e.g., the North-South polarization) and group characteristics carried by ethnic groups in new contexts (i.e., intergroup relations). Thus, reactions to ethnic groups seem to differ partly depending on countries of origin mixed in people’s minds with information about geography, climate, and national wealth in the social perception process. Stereotypes associated with ethnic groups across countries to some extent track the stereotypes associated with the ecologies in which these ethnic groups are assumed to predominantly live. This highlights the importance of the establishment or expansion of policies and programs regarding international inequality. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Do significant pro-immigration reforms–that open legal pathways for labor and family immigration–increase populist voting? Despite the common assumption that such reforms would lead to counter-productive voter backlash informed by the literature on immigrant group threat, the extent to which immigration policy itself influences voters has been unclear. To address this question, this paper estimates the impact of immigration policies on (right-wing) populist voting and immigration attitudes by exploiting the timing of major changes to immigration legislation in a new dataset linking the best available public opinion and policy data across the last 40 years in 24 European countries. My analysis shows that while the absolute levels of immigration policy openness are associated with slightly higher populist voting across countries in a naive cross-sectional analysis, pro-immigration (or anti-immigration) policy changes do not affect populist voting or immigration concerns within countries. This suggests that pro-immigration reforms do not backfire due to voter backlash. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The economic crisis of 2007/2008 did not affect all members of the European Union (EU) to the same extent. In the Irish case, the economic crisis and subsequent period of austerity paralleled an erosion in public support for immigration. However, little is known about how public perception changed during a period of short-term economic recovery, like that experienced in Ireland from 2014 to 2018. Using repeated cross-sectional survey data unique to Ireland, this work captures change in attitudes towards immigrants during the pre-crisis and late-austerity periods. Moreover, this research evaluates the importance placed on two immigrant attributes intimately linked to the labour market — education and skills. We provide evidence of an emergence of more moderate views of immigration during the recovery period, but only in the perceived importance of educational qualifications. Perception of skills remains notably unchanged. Of note, both attributes remain more important in the public eye relative to before the economic crisis. In other words, short-term economic recovery does not automatically translate into a more welcoming reception. We confirm that crises and periods of austerity erode public perception of newcomers, particularly when immigration is framed in terms of skill-based economic contribution. However, this work reveals some of the scars of a rapid and deep economic downturn alter the context of reception in a durable way, which remains notably resistant to short-term recovery. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study draws on results of an opinion survey about public views in Afghanistan regarding concepts related to federalism. We argue that concepts such as unitarism, federalism, centralization, and decentralization are highly politicized and often misunderstood when they enter the public discourse. As the survey results indicate, the association of ethnic groups with different systems of governance, although popular in Afghanistan, is misleading. A concurrent majority of ethnic groups takes a more nuanced approach of favoring central authorities on some issues, local authorities on others, and shared or divided authorities on the rest. The findings are helpful in contributing to a better understanding of how Afghans view federalism, and also by providing guidance to constitution-makers in designing institutional arrangements and distributions of power that address society's needs. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Research Summary: This study examines how incumbent director reactions to media coverage of the #MeToo movement have impacted the evaluation of prospective corporate directors. We argue that heightened intergroup anxiety related to male–female interactions leads incumbents to seize on social attributes that bolster category-based trust in the reliability of prospective directors' interpersonal behavior. We predict that in response to #MeToo coverage, incumbents evaluate board candidates more positively when they share demographic characteristics or have prior social connections, and these effects are strengthened when incumbents socially identify with the firm. Empirical analyses using a longitudinal survey of evaluations of director candidates support these predictions. Our findings suggest how social movements can produce unintended consequences by inadvertently triggering psychological processes that partially offset the anticipated benefits of the movement. Managerial Summary: Increased coverage of #MeToo has heightened concerns among board members about male–female interactions on the board. Our study finds that as #MeToo coverage increases, incumbent directors evaluate potential board candidates more positively to the extent that they share demographic characteristics, including gender, race, functional background, education and age, or when they are connected through the social network of board appointments. These effects are especially pronounced for incumbents who psychologically identify with the firm, meaning that their self-concept is aligned with features of the organization. Our study suggests how psychological reactions of corporate directors to #MeToo may inadvertently reduce board diversity and overall board effectiveness, and we call for research-based interventions to correct this unfortunate side effect of a critically important social justice movement. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Among European countries, the UK remains one of the important destinations for many from Asian regions, specifically, India and Pakistan. “EU Countries Granted Citizenship” (2019) states that Indians are the majority (52%) to receive British citizenship. Relations between the State and the immigrants have always remained dynamic. This dynamism is due to the needs of the host and that of the guest, which keeps altering simultaneously. The mismatch in these needs creates conflicts and thus a gate-keeping by the host is introduced through Immigration Policies. There is a certain level of subtle negotiation that takes place as these policies get firmed up. The UK has a significant assurance for the migration population through its policies, despite political desire to curb the immigrant population. Hence, there seems to be a dilemma among the immigrants if the state is curtailing their presence or accepting them as one among the hosts. To understand the intention of the state, a five-step framework analysis (using the Ritchie and Spencer 1994 model) of the immigration policies of the UK is carried out. In this paper, an attempt is made to present the representation of interests of Indian immigrants in the Immigration Policies of the UK. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Two parallel processes structure American politics in the current moment: partisan polarization and the increasing linkage between racial attitudes and issue preferences of all sorts. We develop a novel theory that roots these two trends in historical changes in party coalitions. Changing racial compositions of the two major parties led to the formation of racialized images about Democrats and Republicans in people's minds - and these images now structure Americans' partisan loyalties and policy preferences. We test this theory in three empirical studies. First, using the American National Election Studies we trace the growing racial gap in party coalitions as well as the increasing overlap between racial and partisan affect. Then, in two original survey studies we directly measure race-party schemas and explore their political consequences. We demonstrate that race-party schemas are linked to partisan affect and issue preferences - with clear implications for the recent developments in U.S. politics. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Ethnonationalist politics have been on the rise in the United States since the 2008 financial crisis, culminating with the rise of Donald Trump. We examine why two seemingly unconnected things - economic crises and prejudice - so often arise simultaneously. Combining theories of economics and emotions, we connect economic crises and prejudice through the role of emotional response to crises, namely anger and anxiety. We use two survey experiments in the United States to test various theories of how emotions might connect economic threat to negative intergroup attitudes. We find that economic concerns increase both anger and anxiety among individuals, but that these emotions have distinct effects on prejudice. Angry individuals show increased prejudice, but only towards groups one is ideologically predisposed to be prejudiced towards. In contrast, anxiety exhibits few consistent effects on prejudice. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - This paper studies the assimilation of ethnic minority individuals to the native labor market and the impact of integration policies on assimilation. In our theoretical model, ethnic individuals choose, depending on their productivity level, among: entrepreneurship, assimilating to the native labor market, and being employed by coethnic entrepreneurs. We find that when integration policies increase the returns of assimilation to the native labor market, there will be more ethnic entrepreneurs and more workers hired in the ethnic sector. This counter-intuitive result is due to wage adjustment in the ethnic sector. In terms of social welfare, we find that the social planner prefers that more ethnic individuals assimilate to the native labor market relative to the decentralized equilibrium. We propose a policy mix that restores the efficiency of the equilibrium. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Drug policy has been subjected to much scrutiny from different stakeholder groups who present sometimes very different opinions on solutions to address a problem. Reconciling such differences, that are underpinned by both anecdotal and empirical evidence, is a priority yet to be fully achieved. In this study, we examine: (i) whether differences exist among actor groups regarding their perceived importance in policymaking; (ii) whether those who dominate the decision process value the input of laypeople or minority actors; and (iii) whether differences exist, with regard to i and ii, between study sites (i.e. Australia and Hong Kong) that have markedly different drug strategies. Overall, differential preference weightings between dominant groups reveal a strong influence of political orientation. Results suggest that decisions made by health professionals were regarded as the most important, while most of the respondent groups gave a low preference toward policy decisions made by law enforcers. Dominant groups also tend to discount the inputs of laypeople and other minority groups. Our study highlights the importance for policy actor groups to consider such a differential weighting of inputs when synthesising knowledge and gathering opinions for the development of drug policy. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study applies the dynamic perspective of realistic conflict theory to assess whether and the extent that individuals' negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities changed and were linked to changes in individuals' economic situations. Employing Dutch panel data, we found that negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities were remarkably stable. Differences in attitudes toward ethnic minorities were more pronounced between individuals than within individuals. The small changes that did occur over the 10-year study period were hardly explained by economic characteristics. Only increased individual dissatisfaction with the national financial situation was associated with more negative attitudes. These results cast doubt on whether attitudes toward ethnic minorities are susceptible to change and raise questions about realistic conflict theory's relevance in explaining attitudinal change. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - We explore attitudes toward internal and foreign migration in China using an original survey experiment. If labor-market competition drives attitudes, then residents will be opposed to migrants with comparable skill levels, regardless of migrant origin. If residents fear a dilution of national identity, then they will be more opposed to foreign than internal migration. We conduct a national survey in Mainland China, where we randomly assign respondents to answer questions about migrants with different skill levels and from either foreign countries or other provinces in China. We find that attitudes cleave over skill level, but the foreign-internal dimension is, on its own, not a salient cleavage in preferences. However, when considering high-skilled migrants, respondents are more supportive of foreign than internal migration; when considering low-skilled migrants, they are more opposed to foreign than internal migration. The results cast doubt on material explanations for attitudes toward migration and suggest a reevaluation of cultural threat arguments that privilege national borders. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been growing interest in “moving beyond the individual” to measure area-level racism as a social determinant of health. Much of this work has aggregated racial prejudice data collected at the individual-level to the area-level. Objective: As this is a rapidly emerging area of research, we conducted a systematic literature review to describe evidence of the relationship between area-level racial prejudice and health, whether results differed by race/ethnicity, and to characterize key conceptual and methodological considerations to guide future research. Method: We searched four interdisciplinary databases for US-based, peer-reviewed articles measuring area level racial prejudice by aggregating individual-level indicators of racial prejudice and examining associations with mental or physical health outcome (s). Data extraction followed PRISMA guidelines and also included theory and conceptualization, pathways to health, and strengths and limitations. Results: Fourteen of 14,632 identified articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Health outcomes spanned all-cause (n = 4) and cause-specific (n = 4) mortality, birth outcomes (n = 4), cardiovascular outcomes (n = 2), mental health (n = 1), and self-rated health (n = 1). All studies found a positive association between area-level racial prejudice and adverse health outcomes among racial/ethnic minoritized groups, with four studies also showing a similar association among Whites. Engagement with formal theory was limited and exposure conceptualization was mixed. Methodological considerations included unmeasured confounding and trade-offs between generalizability, self-censorship, and specificity of measurement. Conclusions: Future research should continue to develop the conceptual and methodological rigor of this work and test hypotheses to inform evidence-based interventions to advance population health and reduce racial health inequities. © 2022.

AB  - Existing research mainly analyzes mass attitudes towards the European Union (EU) from the national and individual-level perspective. This paper adds to this literature by focusing on the relationship between EU support and subnational economic conditions, using harmonized survey data covering 40 years and 1.1 million respondents in 197 European regions. We first describe Europe's changing subnational conditions in terms of catch-up, wealthy, declining and glass-ceiling regions. The paper then develops and tests a set of hypotheses regarding the temporally dynamic relationship between EU attitudes and regions’ long- and short-term economic conditions. Our analyses reveal important longitudinal variations in this relationship with low levels of geographic differentiation in public opinion giving way to clear spatial differences in recent years. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the Great Recession and Brexit have generated a new geography of both Euroscepticism in Europe's declining regions and EU support in its wealthy and catch-up regions. © 2022 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Although uniquely destructive and wasteful, intergroup conflict and warfare are not confined to humans. They are seen across a range of group-living species, from social insects, fishes and birds to mammals, including nonhuman primates. With its unique collection of theory, research and review contributions from biology, anthropology and economics, this theme issue provides novel insights into intergroup conflict across taxa. Here, we introduce and organize this theme issue on the origins and consequences of intergroup conflict. We provide a coherent framework by modelling intergroup conflicts as multi-level games of strategy in which individuals within groups cooperate to compete with (individuals in) other groups for scarce resources, such as territory, food, mating opportunities, power and influence. Within this framework, we identify cross-species mechanisms and consequences of (participating in) intergroup conflict. We conclude by highlighting crosscutting innovations in the study of intergroup conflict set forth by individual contributions. These include, among others, insights on how within-group heterogeneities and leadership relate to group conflict, how intergroup conflict shapes social organization and how climate change and environmental degradation transition intergroup relations from peaceful coexistence to violent conflict. © 2022 Royal Society Publishing.

AB  - We examined how individuals who may be labelled ‘conspiracy theorists’ respond to discrimination against ‘conspiracy theorists’. In line with the Rejection-Identification Model (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77, 135, 1999), we hypothesized that perceived group-based discrimination against conspiracy theorists would strengthen identification with the ‘conspiracy theorist’ ingroup. We propose that this relationship might be mediated by meta-conspiracy beliefs, that is, the belief that the discrimination of conspiracy theorists is itself a conspiracy. Three studies (Ns = 97, 364, 747) among participants who had been labelled as ‘conspiracy theorist’ in the past (Studies 1 and 2) or who had been labelled as such at the beginning of the experiment (Study 3) revealed robust positive relationships between perceived discrimination of conspiracy theorists, meta conspiracy beliefs, and identification. Furthermore, in Studies 2 and 3, identification was strongly associated with positive intergroup differentiation and pride to be a conspiracy theorist. However, there was no evidence that a manipulation of discrimination with bogus public opinion polls affected ‘conspiracy theorist’ identification or meta-conspiracy beliefs. A Bayesian internal meta-analysis of the studies returned moderate (for group identification) to strong (for meta-conspiracy beliefs) support for the null hypothesis. In contrast, in Study 3, a manipulation of discrimination by powerholders enhanced both identification and meta-conspiracy beliefs. This suggests that the source of discrimination moderates the causal relationship between perceived discrimination of conspiracy theorists and group identification. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Ethnic diversity and interethnic contact are increasing in Europe. Intergroup contact theory suggests interethnic contact to improve interethnic attitudes, but for young children, parental attitudes toward child interethnic relations might be an important factor determining whether they are exposed to these potentially positive contact effects. This study therefore examined maternal attitudes toward child contact with different ethnic outgroups among 251 mothers (137 White Dutch, 69 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of a 6- to 10-year-old child (M = 7.51, SD = 0.98). Furthermore, associations between maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations and child outgroup rejection were examined, as well as mediation effects of child actual outgroup contact. Neutral to positive maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations were found, with relatively more negative attitudes among Turkish-Dutch than White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers, and toward child relations with Muslims as compared to another outgroup among White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers. Furthermore, results did not indicate that maternal attitudes were related to child actual outgroup contact or child outgroup prejudice and no support for the intergroup contact theory was found. These results suggest that intergroup contact theory does not easily apply, highlighting the need for more research on children in various populations and contexts using different measures and informants. Patterns from the present study suggest that most improvement in terms of maternal attitudes fostering child interethnic relations can be made in the interethnic relations including ethnic groups in the Netherlands that predominantly identify as Muslim. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Strong interpersonal bonds between group members have been found to either increase intergroup antipathy or improve intergroup attitudes, depending on the intergroup situation. However, the question of whether close ties with fellow group members can contribute positively and negatively to intergroup attitudes at the same time remains unexplored. We explore this question in the context of a national group taking the example of Finns' acculturation attitudes toward immigrants. One adolescent sample (N = 401) and one adult student sample (N = 285) completed surveys assessing these factors. Across both studies, strong interpersonal bonds with fellow nationals showed a negative effect on acculturation attitudes toward immigrants via an increase in blind patriotism. At the same time, interpersonal bonds also had a direct and positive effect on attitudes toward contact with Finns and (among younger respondents only) attitudes toward cultural maintenance. Our results indicate that the strength of interpersonal bonds with fellow nationals has simultaneous and opposing associations with acculturation attitudes via a combination of direct and indirect pathways. Based on these results we argue that groups can be simultaneously both caring and moral communities. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - A standard assumption in realistic threat theories is that the presence of ethnic minorities is associated with a rise of anti-immigrant sentiments. However, we do not know whether this presence has a specific local effect, or whether one can detect a more general nationwide perception of threat. Using data from a recent Belgian population survey, we assess the association between ethnic diversity within the local community and anti-immigrant sentiments. Results suggest a strong negative association between the level of ethnic diversity and anti-immigrant sentiments. Furthermore, while we do not find evidence for an association between ethnic diversity and radical right voting on the individual level, there is a strong negative correlation on the aggregate level. We conclude with some speculation about how anti-immigrant sentiments are created in areas with a very low levels of ethnic diversity, and what this implies for the electoral potential of radical-right parties. © 2022 Swiss Political Science Association.

AB  - Attitudinal studies illustrate high levels of support toward homosexuality across European countries. Although these patterns suggest that European societies are becoming more progressive and tolerant, they do not extend to Muslim migration. As Western conceptions of liberalism are increasingly defined in terms of tolerance of sexual minorities as a marker of societal progress, persistent anti-Muslim sentiment presents a liberalism paradox. Existing research often explores these two social topics independently, with limited attention to their intersection. Moving beyond this unidimensional lens, we draw on the frameworks of homonationalism and illiberal liberalism to provide insights into how seemingly incompatible perspectives are mutually constitutive and operate in the service of individuals’ self-interest. We use latent class analysis to examine attitudinal configurations related to homosexuality and Muslim exclusion from the 7th wave (2014) of the European Social Survey (ESS). Our analysis identifies three dominant attitudinal clusters. We find that most respondents held multidimensional views—supporting homosexuality while simultaneously rejecting Muslim migration—consistent with selective tolerance and homonationalist perspectives. The remaining two clusters held unified viewpoints, either rejecting both homosexuality and Muslim migration or favoring both. Predicting these attitudinal configurations with socio-demographic characteristics and attitudes towards immigration, we find that those with selective tolerance-homonationalist perspectives occupy a precarious middle-class position characterized by low levels of educational attainment and lower-status white-collar occupations. We find evidence that individuals in this tenuous social class position express both economic and cultural threat by reappropriating tolerant views toward homosexuality for the purpose of justifying Muslim exclusion. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Many studies have identified ethnic divisions as an obstacle to successful democratization. The present study examines political attitudes among ethnic majority Malays and two minority communities, Chinese and Indians, in Malaysia, a country which took a step toward democratization with a change of national government in 2018, yet seems to have reverted to single-party dominance. Utilizing survey data from 2006 to 2019, we compare attitudes at four levels of political support among the three ethnic communities: rejection of authoritarian regimes, confidence in public institutions, engagement in channels of political participation, and national pride. The availability of data collected after 2018 allows us to detect changes following the country’s first national-level power alternation. Empirical analysis reveals that in recent years the Chinese are significantly more likely to reject non-democratic regime alternatives to democracy compared with the ethnic majority Malays. Moreover, the Chinese community's long-held distrust in the government, parliament, judiciary and civil service has faded by 2019, suggesting a change of attitude brought by the 2018 election. On the other hand, while all three ethnic groups express some degree of national pride in the surveys, ethnic minorities are less likely to be very proud of being Malaysian compared with ethnic Malays. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2060, Latinx, African Americans, Asians, and other "minority"groups will together comprise the majority of the country's population. Past research has found that non-Hispanic Whites, hereafter Whites, find such projections disquieting or threatening. Yet, recent surveys reveal that when given more than binary good/bad choices, most Whites opt for the middle-point response that this development will be "neither good nor bad for the country."How can we account for this seemingly ambiguous evaluation of projected ethnoracial demographic futures? Using eight waves of nationally representative U.S. survey data collected between 2015 and 2018, this article begins to unpack the "neither"response among Whites, exploring what it might mean and what factors are associated with it, relative to seemingly optimistic and pessimistic stances. Multinomial Logistic Regression analyses and additional descriptive analyses indicate that "neither good nor bad"in this context is a substantive response: White "Neithers"are socio-demographically and attitudinally distinct from their counterparts. Our study demonstrates the value of moving beyond an exclusive focus on expressions of demographic threat and pessimism. Moreover, it invites further investigation into factors that inform and shape how Whites and other ethnoracial populations in the U.S. understand and assess projected population shifts. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - This study examines how Puerto Ricans in Florida make sense of the immigration debate, how they formulate their position on the debate, and how their immigration attitudes impact their political choices. I draw on 75 in-depth interviews I conducted in Orlando, Florida during the 2016 presidential election. I find most respondents express supportive attitudes toward undocumented immigration, yet, how they articulate their position is telling. Specifically, respondents deploy mainstream narratives of immigrant deservingness/undeservingness; and a coalescing of Latino group consciousness, and in some instances a sense of connected political futures, influence their views. I also find Puerto Ricans’ immigration views provide insight into their 2016 vote for president. This study contributes to immigration, race, and Latino scholarship by uncovering nuance and complexity of Latinos’ contemporary politics. In doing so, it captures the emergence of a different strand of Latinidad and Latino politics in the largest swing state of the U.S. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Public attitudes regarding privatization are important for both political and normative reasons. Past studies of public opinion on privatization have shown how socio-economic variables and ideology shape public views. In this study, we focus on a relatively under-researched factor: identity as it relates to actor preference formation. We explore attitudes toward different privatization types in a society, in which the main political fault lines are not economic, but identity-based: primarily predicated on ethnic group membership and religiosity. Based on a random sample of 1142 Israeli adults, we find that unlike most other countries, identity variables matter more than Socio-Economic Status (SES) in this type of society despite the fact that privatization is primarily perceived as an economic policy. While high levels of religiosity are associated with support for privatization, membership in an ethnic minority, in contrast, is related to negative attitudes. The contrast between the relatively favourable views of ultra-orthodox Jews to the negative ones of Arabs suggests that identity group attitudes toward neoliberal policies cannot simply be explained by SES. Moreover, not only does identity matter for shaping views on public policy, but also the particular specifics of a given identity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Dementia is the decline in cognitive function sufficient to impair one's accustomed functioning. Countries with aging populations, such as Singapore, face rising rates of dementia. Dementia patients and their caregivers endure great financial and emotional stress. With the broad aim of minimizing these stresses, this study provides a cross-sectional view of the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) towards dementia in middle-aged Singaporean residents. Objective: We aim to examine 1) the associations between demographic correlates and KAP; and 2) the effect of dementia knowledge on attitudes and perceptions towards dementia. Methods: An online anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents aged 45 to 65 years old in English, Mandarin, and Malay. Knowledge was evaluated across three domains: symptoms, risk factors, and management. Total and domain scores were dichotomized as good or poor knowledge using median cut-offs. Attitudes/perceptions across six domains were evaluated on Likert scales, and responses to each question were dichotomized into positive or negative attitudes/perceptions. Results: From 1,733 responses, 1,209 valid complete responses were accepted (mean age±SD 54.8±5.12 years old, females=69.6%). Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer knowledge and greater barriers to risk-mitigating lifestyle modifications. Lack of personal experience with dementia and poor knowledge were also associated with erroneous attitudes/perceptions. Conclusion: Socioeconomic status and personal experience affect KAP towards dementia. Policy and education campaigns to address KAP towards dementia should account for baseline differences across demographics, for greater improvements in dementia incidence and support. © 2022-IOS Press.

AB  - This study integrates cultivation and intergroup threat theories to examine media cultivation effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that U.S. media have consistently portrayed China as a threat and target of blame. The cultivation of media has thus resulted in perceived threat of and blame on Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of a cross-sectional survey in two samples (MTurk: N = 375; college: N = 566) showed that the amount of media consumption predicted stronger perceptions that Chinese people were a health threat, and also predicted blame on Chinese people for the COVID-19 outbreak. Threat perception and blame were further associated with support of media content that derogated China, stronger intentions to attack, and weaker intentions to help Chinese people. The findings have profound implications for intergroup threat and cultivation research, and practical importance for intergroup relations, especially when the global community finds itself in a public crisis. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Police officers partially rely on implicit and explicit stereotypes in their interactions with the public. We investigated if these attitudes are reciprocated, specifically, if people of color implicitly fear police, and whether the events of the summer of 2020 changed the public's attitudes about police. Seven hundred and fifty-nine college students (235 BIPOC) participated, 373 in 2019, 386 in fall 2020. BIPOC participants more readily implicitly associated police officers with threat; implicit police-as-threat scores increased after the summer of 2020 regardless of race. Explicit attitudes showed the same pattern: BIPOC participants had less favorable attitudes of police; participants in Fall 2020 had less favorable attitudes of police. Implicit attitudes were predicted by race, time, the experience of being treated with (dis)respect, and an emphasis on the binding aspect of morality. Explicit attitudes were predicted by the same variables, as well as specific community variables, the moral foundation of individualizing, and implicit attitudes. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Surveys conducted across multiple countries show that most people view seeking lower immigration to help maintain the majority group's population share as a sign of racial self-interest—as opposed to racism. We investigated whether the belief that it is not racist to want immigration restrictions for cultural reasons is associated with ingroup identification (a positive attachment to and solidarity with one's group) or collective narcissism (a conviction that the ingroup is exceptional and deserves special treatment). We argue that if this belief reflects concern for the ingroup, it should be linked to ingroup identification. However, if it is a defensive justification of the ingroup's privileged position, it should be linked to collective narcissism. Across four studies, national (Study 1: United Kingdom, N = 467; Study 2: Poland, N = 1,285) and ethnic (Study 3a: United States, N = 2,000; Study 3b: United States, N = 2,938) narcissism emerged as predictors of the belief that ethnoculturally motivated immigration restrictions are racial self-interest (vs. racism). This belief was also associated with justifying collective violence against migrants (Study 2) and supporting the alt-right (Studies 3a–3b). We found less consistent evidence for an association between ingroup identification and immigration-restriction beliefs. We discuss implications for intergroup relations and political extremism. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Why do supporters of radical right parties in Central and Eastern Europe hold economically left-wing policy preferences? In this article, the author argues that this can be explained by welfare chauvinism. First, in ethnically heterogeneous societies, minority groups provide a plausible scapegoat for the grievances emphasized by radical right parties. Therefore, the majority population is sensitive to shifts in the status quo which accrue from policy changes that give minorities greater benefits. Support for redistribution will therefore be lower in more ethnically diverse countries. The salience of shifts in the ethnic group hierarchy also means that objective economic insecurity is less likely to intersect with redistributive preferences. Second, radical right supporters will prefer welfare policies that restrict eligibility to the majority population. This allows radical right parties to combine leftist economic policies with more authoritarian values. The empirical results confirm these expectations. This research contributes to our understanding of the attitudinal bases of radical right party support in Central and Eastern Europe. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The value of intercultural music learning on intergroup attitudes has been demonstrated in the literature, such as enhancing intercultural sensitivity and building interethnic friendships. However, the process by which intercultural music learning influences intergroup attitudes has not yet been illuminated. This study investigated the impact of an intercultural music course on intergroup attitudes among middle school students (N = 277) from Yi, Han, Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups in a multi-ethnic school in Sichuan province, southwest China. The research tools included questionnaire surveys, reflective journals, semi-structured interviews and observational field notes. The findings revealed that the intercultural music course significantly improved the students’ intergroup attitudes compared with the regular and non-music courses. The findings further identified six process dimensions that helped capture the gradual changes in students’ attitudes towards other groups as well as the cumulative nature of the effects of intercultural music learning. This study sheds light on approaches to using music to learn about, communicate with and appreciate other cultures. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Context: Without urgent action, koalas could be extinct in New South Wales (NSW), Australia by 2050. Despite the key role that community members could play in koala protection, we know little about what might motivate them to engage in these actions. Aims: This study surveyed residents (n = 585) of local government areas of far north east NSW to identify demographic and social-psychological factors associated with likelihood of engaging in actions that could help to protect koalas. Methods: A survey using a multi-pronged recruitment process was administered to relevant participants. Key results: Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that the likelihood of joining a community conservation group was greater in the Byron shire and for those with a stronger environmental identity, more positive attitudes toward koalas and who perceived that others who are important to them take action to protect koalas. Byron residents, those with a stronger environmental identity and those with more knowledge about koalas were also more likely to advocate government for koala protection. Positive attitudes towards koalas and perceptions that others who are important to them take action to protect koalas significantly predicted likelihood of restoring native vegetation on respondents' properties. Gender emerged as the only significant predictor of likelihood of joining council conservation initiatives. Conclusions: These findings provide insights that could help guide the efforts of government and non-government agencies in engaging community members with koala protection. Implications: This study identified which factors to target when focusing on koala protection behaviours, and can be used to help guide efforts to build community support for koala protection actions. © 2022 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - Workplace backlash, the explicit/implicit, and/or intentional/unintentional attempts to reject efforts to promote diversity, taken by both dominant and subordinate social group members to maintain the group-based social hierarchy at work, has emerged as a major threat to fostering diversity and inclusiveness in the workplace. Although intense scholarly attention has been paid to workplace backlash, the literature has a highly individualistic and fragmented perspective of backlash, which hinders theoretical advancement. As a remedy for conceptual and theoretical heterogeneity, I first conducted a systematic review of the literature to present a critical overview of past scholarly endeavors and take stock of the empirical evidence. This article provides an alternative, unified definition of workplace backlash drawn from intergroup relations and the power hierarchy among social group members. Finally, based on the perspective of group-based social hierarchy, this study describes the emergence, development, and maintenance of workplace backlash through the lens of social dominance theory. Implications and future research suggestions are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Using microdata from the European Union Labour Force Survey (EU-LFS) and aggregate indicators of labour market institutions, this article compares the job quality of native and non-native workers across European countries and analyses the impact of the institutional settings on the job quality differential between both groups. The LFS is used to measure a job quality index for the period 2005–2017. We find that some immigrant groups fare worse than natives, the contribution of the “composition effect” to explain this differential is large, and the institutional framework affects the immigration gap in job quality. In particular, some labour market institutions (more centralized wage bargaining, stricter employment protection legislation) tend to be detrimental for immigrants relative to natives, while integration policies seem to work well in reducing these differences. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Growing attitudinal and affective differences across party lines and increasing social polarization are often attributed to the strengthening of partisanship as a social identity. Scholars have paid less attention to personal preferences as a contributor to these phenomena. Our focus is on how citizens' policy beliefs - their operational ideologies - are associated with their views of partisan groups. We examine our perspective with two studies. In the first, we find that the attribution of ideologically extreme political views to an individual's peer significantly reduces interest in interpersonal interaction but find limited evidence that partisan group membership alone induces social polarization. In the second, we show that citizens' policy views are strongly associated with their perceptions of their own partisan group as well as their counterpartisans. Together, our results have important implications for understanding the consequences of increased polarization and partisan antipathy in contemporary politics. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Tourism and migration are conceptually linked in terms of the geographical movement of people. In 2018 a large group of Yemeni refugee migrants arrived in Jeju Island, South Korea because of an unforeseen confluence of political and economic pressures in Yemen and a combination of a visa-free policy and cheap airfare from Malaysia to Jeju. They are now semi-permanent residents on the island with no option to re-migrate. A multidimensional set of theoretical themes including social exchange and role identity among stakeholders; power and alienation; and trust and social responsibility are used to evaluate residents’ subjectivities toward Yemeni refugee migrants to Jeju. This is applied to the theoretical interpretation of the public discourse on Yemeni migration to identify residents’ attitudes using Q method. Four clusters of subjectivity are found, grouped around an anti-refugee sentiment. Interaction with and responsibility for this refugee immigrant population is largely rejected. Practical implications are that structural changes in policy or attitude changes through education are necessary to secure any form of social sustainability for the resident-refugee relationship in Jeju. The implication is that the set of theoretical themes used in this study offers a valuable path to finding empirical solutions to the refugee migration problem in tourism research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Past studies have shown that disease threat increases people's hostility towards immigrants. However, in our survey (N = 9571) conducted in five advanced Asian economies during the outbreak of COVID-19, we found that COVID-19 vulnerability was positively associated with support for immigration. Drawing on insight from policy feedback theories, we propose that the positive association is caused by the presence of widespread border crossing restrictions, which have changed the meaning and cost implications of COVID-19. As the outbreak expands, the pandemic has become not just a threat to people's health but also a barrier to globalization. Consequently, people who are worried about the disease may see globalization processes, including migration, as signs of pandemic relief. We find supportive evidence in our analysis. First, the positive association between COVID-19 vulnerability and support for immigration is more salient among respondents who considered restrictions on international travel to be stringent. Second, the positive association between COVID-19 vulnerability and immigration attitude was mediated by perceived economic threat from the pandemic and contribution by immigrants towards the containment of the pandemic. These findings suggest that disease control measures adopted at the global level may alter certain widely accepted effects of disease threat on immigration attitudes. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background Health care managers face the critical challenge of overcoming divisions among the many groups involved in patient care, a problem intensified when patients must flow across multiple settings. Surprisingly, however, the patient flow literature rarely engages with its intergroup dimension. Purpose This study explored how managers with responsibility for patient flow understand and approach intergroup divisions and "silo-ing"in health care. Methodology/Approach We conducted in-depth interviews with 300 purposively sampled senior, middle, and frontline managers across 10 Canadian health jurisdictions. We undertook thematic analysis using sensitizing concepts drawn from the social identity approach. Results Silos, at multiple levels, were reported in every jurisdiction. The main strategies for ameliorating silos were provision of formal opportunities for staff collaboration, persuasive messages stressing shared values or responsibilities, and structural reorganization to redraw group boundaries. Participants emphasized the benefits of the first two but described structural change as neither necessary nor sufficient for improved collaboration. Conclusion Silos, though an unavoidable feature of organizational life, can be managed and mitigated. However, a key challenge in redefining groups is that the easiest place to draw boundaries from a social identity perspective may not be the best place from one of system design. Narrowly defined groups forge strong identities more easily, but broader groups facilitate coordination of care by minimizing the number of boundaries patients must traverse. Practice Implications A thoughtfully designed combination of strategies may help to improve intergroup relations and their impact on flow. It may be ideal to foster a "mosaic"identity that affirms group allegiances at multiple levels. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Advancements in big data analytics offer new avenues for the analysis and deciphering of suspicious activities on the internet. One promising new technology to increase the identification of terrorism threats is based on probabilistic computing. The technology promises to provide more efficient problem solutions in encryption and cybersecurity. Probabilistic computing technologies use large amounts of data, though, which raises potential privacy concerns. A study (N = 1,023) was conducted to survey public support for using probabilistic computing technologies to increase counterterrorism efforts. Overall, strong support was found for the use of publicly available personal information (e.g., personal websites). Regarding private personal information (e.g., online conversations), respondents perceived it to be more appropriate to use information from out-group members (non-American citizens) than from in-group members (American citizens). In line with a social-identity account, this form of in-group favoritism was strongest among respondents displaying a combination of strong national identities and strong privacy concerns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The literature on the emergence of climate change as a security problem notes the lack of studies of audiences that enable the successful construction of climate change as a security issue. While previous studies consider different types of audiences, we focus on public opinion, which provides moral support for securitising moves, to investigate what individual and country level conditions facilitate individuals to identify climate change as a threat to humanity or a risk to themselves. We do so by analysing public attitudes towards climate security in 24 nations covered by the 2015 Pew Global Attitudes Survey. We differentiate between the logics of securitisation and riskification, and different referent objects such as humanity and self. We then identify the patterns of threat and risk perception towards different referent objects in climate security. We find that individuals’ personal insecurities translate into perceived personal risk from climate change while perceived threats to humanity from climate change are related to cognitive resources and sophistication. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND Leukemia is a broad term for blood cell cancer. Leukemia is divided into acute or chronic, depending on cell differentiation. Leukemia patients are prone to adverse reactions during chemotherapy, such as anxiety, depression, and even suicide, affecting prognosis. As a nursing model developed by three well-known cognitive psychologists, empathetic nursing with mindfulness cognitive therapy (ENMCT) can effectively reduce anxiety and depression and improve the quality of life in patients with chronic disease. AIM To explore the effect of ENMCT on cancer-induced fatigue, hope level, and negative emotions in patients with long-term leukemia chemotherapy. METHODS A total of 103 patients with long-term leukemia chemotherapy diagnosed and treated in our hospital from July 2017 to October 2019 were enrolled and randomly assigned to observation and control groups using the random number table approach. Fifty-one patients in the control group received routine nursing, while 52 patients in the observation group received empathic nursing with mindfulness cognitive therapy. After three months of nursing care, cancerinduced fatigue was measured with the Piper Fatigue Scale (PFS), hope level with the Herth Hope Index (HHI), and negative emotion with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA)/Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Self-management (Chinese Strategies Used by People to Promote Health) was also recorded. RESULTS The observation group’s total scores in behavior, cognition, emotion, feeling, and PFS were lower than the control group after the intervention (P < 0.05). Keeping close contact with others, the attitude of taking positive actions, the attitude toward reality and future, and the total HHI score were higher in the observation group than the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group’s HAMA and HAMD scores were lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The observation group’s positive attitude, self-decision, and self-relief scores were greater than the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Empathetic nursing with cognitive mindfulness therapy is beneficial in improving cancer-related fatigue, negative emotions, expectation level, and self-management ability in patients with longterm leukemia chemotherapy © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the context of the border dispute presented by Peru against Chile in the The Hague Court, this study analyzes the influences of two ideological motivational dimensions: Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) on a set of intergroup attitudes that involve both nations. To this end, a survey study of 196 Chileans and 223 Peruvians participants was conducted. The instruments used to measure ideology and political attitudes are the following ones: RWA Scale; SDO Scale; Scale of Intergroup attitudes between Chile-Peru and specific questions on interest in the Hague litigation and willingness to fight for one's country. The results show that in the Peruvian case attitudes of belligerence and alert and a greater willingness to fight for the country are better explained by the RWA, while in the Chilean case these same attitudes are explained both by the RWA as well as the SDO. On the other hand, pacificist attitudes are explained inversely by SDO in both countries. These findings support the hypothesis that intergroup dynamics between both countries have been marked by expressed actions of a Chilean expansionism versus a Peruvian vengefulness and suggest that equalitarianism will promote attitudes toward respect and cooperation between both groups, changing the frames of expansionism and vengefulness for one of a culture of peace. © 2022 Universidad CES.

AB  - Much of the recent work on prejudice emphasizes individual differences, which focuses on the strength of relations between variables on specific instances of prejudice such as racial–ethnic or sexual prejudices. However, the relations between religiosity and prejudice variables are inconsistent and sometimes even paradoxical (Allport, 1954). In three studies of Christian Americans (N = 2,271), we utilized a personcentered data-analytic approach to identify distinct subgroups or profiles characterized by similar selfreported prejudices. Our results support four distinct profiles of prejudice among Christians in the United States. We labeled the profiles of prejudices Generalized, Tepid, Sanctioned, and Warm. The Generalized profile demonstrated prejudice toward people in historically disadvantaged racial, ethnic, and sexual orientation groups. People in the Sanctioned profile demonstrated a pattern of value-based prejudice. The Tepid profile reported neutral attitudes toward people groups, and the Warm profile reported positive attitudes toward minority groups and warm (but slightly less so) attitudes toward conservative groups. These results support the generalized and value violation models of prejudice and provide further insight to other variations in prejudice among Christian Americans. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Important but broad values such as “social responsibility” are understood differently by different groups, understandings that often reflect the values and traits of the ingroup. This research examines whether the tendency to project the characteristics of the ingroup onto understandings of “social responsibility” correlates with negative intergroup attitudes as would be expected on the basis of the ingroup projection literature. Building on recent research, we also examined whether reassuring people of their group’s identification as socially responsible might remove the correlation between projection and negative outgroups attitudes without reducing the rate of projection. Two experimental studies using the ingroup projection model provide support for these expectations. The research was conducted at a secular university (N = 188) and a religious university (N = 69) that profess different understandings of social responsibility. At both universities, projection and negative attitudes were correlated when the ingroup’s membership in the broader category of socially responsible students was threatened and in the control condition, but not when their membership in the broader category was reassured. Importantly, the rates of projection did not differ across the three conditions (control, threat, and reassurance), suggesting that reassurance does not reduce projection, but rather changes its defensive nature. These findings suggest the value of reassuring groups of their membership within broad, abstract categories, as it may allow for the kinds of conceptual disagreements that make up healthy societal debate while simultaneously discouraging the tendency for those disagreements to spill over into more general negative intergroup attitudes. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - A growing body of scholarship documents the intersectional nature of social stereotyping, with stereotype content being shaped by a target person’s multiple social identities. However, conflicting findings in this literature highlight the need for a broader theoretical integration. For example, although there are contexts in which perceivers stereotype gay Black men and heterosexual Black men in very different ways, so too are there contexts in which perceivers stereotype these men in very similar ways. We develop and test an explanation for contradictory findings of this sort. In particular, we argue that perceivers have a repertoire of lenses in their minds—identity-specific schemas for categorizing others—and that characteristics of the perceiver and the social context determine which one of these lenses will be used to organize social perception. Perceivers who are using the lens of race, for example, are expected to attend to targets’ racial identities so strongly that they barely attend, in these moments, to targets’ other identities (e.g., their sexual orientations). Across six experiments, we show (a) that perceivers tend to use just one lens at a time when thinking about others, (b) that the lenses perceivers use can be singular and simplistic (e.g., the lens of gender by itself) or intersectional and complex (e.g., a race-by-gender lens, specifically), and (c) that different lenses can prescribe categorically distinct sets of stereotypes that perceivers use as frameworks for thinking about others. This lens-based account can resolve apparent contradictions in the literature on intersectional stereotyping, and it can likewise be used to generate novel hypotheses. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - In this study we analyze distinct socio-political predictors, namely, system justification, moral foundations, political ideology, social dominance orientation and authoritarianism, of two distinct but interrelated postcolonial ideologies, namely symbolic exclusion and historical negation in regards to the Mapuche people, in a sample of the general Chilean population (n = 1.242). According to the results, symbolic exclusion is explained by the political ideology of the participants, their social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification and one specific moral foundations’ dimension: harm/care. On the other hand, right-wing authoritarianism, system justification, political ideology, and two specific moral foundations (loyalty/betrayal and authority/subversion) play an important role in predicting the historical negation of negative events affecting the Mapuche Indigenous people in Chile. Our results are discussed in terms of their implications for present-day intergroup relations between the Mapuche and non-Indigenous Chileans. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The article examines a reform of internal immigration policing in Finland. It discusses the public debate on ethnic profiling and the legal reform process of regulating immigration law enforcement by the Finnish government from 2013 to 2015 through an analysis of official documents and media coverage. The reform included elements of both criminalisation of migration and human rights protections. The Finnish government added a ban on ethnic profiling in the Aliens Act. At the same time, it gave the police and the border guard more powers to conduct identity checks on foreign citizens. The paper argues that regulation and practices of immigration policing are affected by power positions of different national actors and the nature of public debate. The presence of ethnic minorities and representatives of civil society during the policy process and public discussions on ethnic and racial profiling in Finland was negligible. Both immigration policing and immigration law enforcement policy-making risk repeating formally equal patterns that are, in practice, biased. © 2022 The authors.

AB  - The study of authoritarianism has a long history in the field of psychology; however, much of this research focuses on Western countries, especially the United States. In effort to better understand authoritarianism cross-culturally, we explore the current state of authoritarianism in an important cultural context: Russia. Thus, the current paper reports on large-scale research of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation in the modern Russian context. Six studies (total N = 1,358) included personality traits, basic human values, social beliefs, and intergroup attitudes that allowed us to comprehensively consider authoritarian attitudes in Russia. The results showed that personological profile and pattern of reaction to threat among Russian authoritarians is similar to Western authoritarians. However, economic views inherited from Soviet ideology make Russians differ in their view of economic conservatism from that supported by Western authoritarians. These data provide insight into the psychology of authoritarianism as well as explore novel aspects of Russian culture. © 2022 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Recent studies find that increasing ethnic diversity through immigration reduces support for welfare states. Using multilevel analysis of a wide sample of countries (≅100) and a large sampling of individuals (≅310,000), we find little evidence to suggest that the degree of diversity or antipathy towards ethnic others alone matter in explaining attitudes towards equity or public action aimed at reducing inequalities. Attitudes against reducing inequality are revealed mostly when the size of the majority ethnic group's share is smaller, but only among people with preexisting skeptical attitudes towards ethnic and racial others. Those with no prejudicial attitudes show higher levels of support for equity. These effects are strongest when testing only a sample of Western countries. The results support the notion that sociotropic factors related to cultural biases are what matter, rather than fears attached to demographic change and increased ethnic competition in the economic realm. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2022 | doi:10.1163/15718115-bja10070

AB  - Based on ethnographic fieldwork, this article explores the intricate relationships between three major ethno-racial groups residing in a suburban town in the New York metropolitan area. At the present time, the prosperous Korean ethnoburb is gentrified by Korean immigrants, triggering the displacement of the old-timers, referred to as the “White exodus” in this research. Granted that the cheap labor is in high demand in the rejuvenating neighborhood, the town has become a magnet for Guatemalan immigrants who have established their own ethnic islet in the vicinity. While the relationships between the Asian immigrants and the White old-timers generated by invasion-succession trends are full of resentment, the work-related interactions between the Asian and Hispanic (mostly Guatemalan) immigrants can be described as immigrant symbiosis. Both groups are aware of explicit exploitation, but they need and rely on each other to attain their own “American dream.”. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Substance use (SU) among adolescents is a critical public health concern that increases the risk for negative outcomes. Although Asian American (AA) adolescents tend to report low rates of SU, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NH/PI) adolescents often report significantly higher rates of use. Yet, NH/PI youth are seldom studied as a separate group. Consequently, little is known about the factors involved in SU among NH/PI adolescents and how to prevent it. This prospective study investigated the effect of ecological risk and protective factors at the individual, family, and school levels on SU for NH/PI adolescents. This prospective study utilized longitudinal data from 120 NH/PI adolescents who were7 part of an SU prevention program. Information was collected at two time points—Time 1 and Time 2 (32 weeks later)— and included adolescents’ SU behaviors and individual, family, and school factors. The parents of these adolescents also provided data; all information was self-report. Positive academic attitudes at Time 1 were negatively associated with alcohol and other drug (e.g., marijuana) use at Time 2. Specifically, NH/PI adolescents who had more positive attitudes toward their school, peers, and teachers reported less alcohol and other SU. Prevention efforts may be most effective for NH/PI adolescents if addressed within the school context. This may include programs implemented in schools, utilizing teachers as role models, and/or promoting prosocial peer relationships to support positive behaviors. Additional implications are discussed. © 2021 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice

AB  - Purpose: Intergroup contact is an effective strategy to improve intergroup relationships. Although intergroup relationships have been studied extensively, the individual roles of quantity and quality of contact in relationships with cognition, emotion, and intention of behavior toward other ethnic minority groups are not fully understood. This study explores the situation via network analysis among Zhuang and Yao ethnic minorities in Southwest China. Methods: We investigated the quantity and quality of intergroup contact and cognition, emotion, and intention of behavior among a sample of 543 Zhuang and 490 Yao ethnic group members. Data were analyzed using the R-package. Network structures were analyzed via the Qgraph package, and the accuracy and stability of the network were measured via the Bootnet package; communities were detected via the Igraph package; bridge analyses were conducted via the Networktools package; and the network difference was compared via the Network Comparison Test package. Results: The results indicated perceived intimacy is the central node. Quantity of contact constructed a community with “perceived connection,” “sense of community,” “knowledge about out-group,” and “perceived similarity.” Meanwhile, quality of contact constructed a community with “intergroup attitude” and a “feeling thermometer.” The remainder of the nodes constructed two additional communities. The network global connectivity and structure between the two ethnic groups were highly similar. Conclusion: The study examined the quantity and quality of intergroup contact via network analysis for two ethnic minority groups. It was shown that the two groups’ global network structures of intergroup contact and their effects are highly similar. Specifically, quantity and quality of contact produce different effects on intergroup relations. Quantity of contact has proximal effects, including instant cognitive and emotional response without depth cognition, while quality of contact has proximal effects that may change deep-seated cognition and subsequently improve intergroup relations. © 2022 Yu et al.

AB  - Trinidad and Tobago is mostly split between two main ethnic groups of African and Indian origins, yet there is little empirical research on the importance of these social cleavages in voting behaviour in the country. One branch of scholarly work on ethnic voting suggests that individuals use social identities as heuristics to evaluate candidates. However, another line of research has found that the role of ethnicity in elections is declining in specific contexts. This manuscript explores the importance of ethnic cleavages in voting patterns in Trinidad and Tobago. We use the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP) surveys and conduct a series of probit models to test which factors influence voting the most in the twin-islands. We find that ethnicity is the main factor associated with voters’ choice, but other factors that are associated with voting decisions, such as voters’ political ideology, education, and place of residence. These findings inform the ongoing debate on the importance of ethnicity in voting behaviour. © 2022 The Editor of Ethnopolitics.

AB  - This paper investigates the question of whether and how restrictive immigration policies affect the earnings of Latinxs who are not the target of these policies—that is, Latinx citizens. Focusing on policies at the state (E-Verify) and county (287(g)) level, we investigate possible spillover on Latinx citizen earnings from 2006 through 2016. We use multiple sources of data, merging policy and census data with two national probability samples of Latinx citizens. Our results show that E-Verify and 287(g) affect earnings similarly. Laws leave wage-employed workers unaffected and instead exclusively shape the earnings of self-employed respondents. Among self-employed, policy effects depend on the type of county respondents live in. Once laws like 287(g) or E-Verify go into effect, Latinx self-employed see dramatic earnings losses when living outside of ethnic enclaves, while seeing earnings gains when living within predominantly-Latinx counties. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Anti-intellectualism—a distrust of intellectuals and experts—has had a significant political presence in the U.S. and globally, especially in recent years. Anti-intellectualism drives support for phenomena such as populism, a rejection of scientific consensus, and health and science misinformation endorsement. Therefore, discovering what drives someone to be more anti-intellectual is highly important in understanding contemporary public opinion and political behavior. Here, I argue that a significant and overlooked factor contributing to anti-intellectualism is rural social identification—a psychological attachment to being from a rural area or small town—because rural identity in particular views experts and intellectuals as an out-group. Using 2019 ANES pilot data (N = 3000), original survey data (N = 811) and a separate original survey experiment, I find that rural social identification significantly predicts greater anti-intellectualism. Conversely, anti-intellectualism is not significantly associated with rural residency alone, as theoretically speaking, simply living in a rural area does not capture the affective dimension of rural psychological attachment. These findings have implications for health and science attitudes, populist support, and other relevant political matters. They also have implications for what it means to hold a rural identity beyond anti-urban sentiment, and for understanding the urban–rural divide. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Immigrant communities in Chile face barriers to their integration, in the form of discrimination and social exclusion. Psychology of liberation claims that, when minority groups experience oppressing conditions, community engagement can be a path toward integration. Nevertheless, community participation has been mainly studied in North America and Europe. Through a concurrent nested mixed-method design, this study explores the relation between community engagement and perception of integration of Peruvian immigrants in Santiago de Chile. One hundred and ten Peruvians (age range 19 to 52 years), engaged in migrant organizations (MOs), completed a self-report questionnaire that aims to identify the predictors of integration based on psychosocial perspective (education), acculturation (national identity and ethnic identity), and liberation psychology literature (perceived institutional sensitivity, knowledge of the Chilean culture and laws). Additionally, 18 Peruvian leaders (ages 31 to 56 years) were interviewed in order to explore intergroup relations and organizational strategies that their MOs use to enhance integration. An interesting and novel finding points to the role of a Latin-American identity that appears to have potential negative consequences in maintaining the status quo for the social exclusion that Peruvians currently face. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Although food and politics seem to be distant domains, socio-political ideology and food neophobia (i.e., reluctance to eat unfamiliar food) may be related. Conservatives' high threat sensitivity and the inherently threatening nature of novel foods (the existential explanation), along with conservatives' negative attitudes toward minority outgroups (e.g., foreigners) and the role of the latter in introducing novel foods to a culture (the social explanation), led us to expect that socio-political ideology would predict food neophobia over and above their common roots. Across two correlational and two experimental studies (N = 627), socio-political ideology emerged as a strong predictor of food neophobia. In addition, the findings did not support the existential explanation, while confirming the social explanation of the ideology- food neophobia link: Conservatives seem more neophobic than liberals not because of their higher threat sensitivity but rather because they hold more negative attitudes toward foreigners who are associated with those foods. © 2022 Guidetti et al.

AB  - The comprehensive, twofold goal of this paper is to investigate how social identities in a multilayered social platform of a public hospital are shaped, and to explain the impact of these identities on staff interrelations, patients, and the organization’s overall ability to meet challenges. We conducted a qualitative study, collecting data from 30 employees working in a medium-sized public hospital in Israel using a semi-structured interview guide. Using a thematic analysis approach and drawing on social identity theory, we found that departmental identity is the most prominent social identity associated with the hospital staff. This identity was strengthened by strong in-group management, but little influenced by senior out-group management; its importance also caused organizational goals to be overlooked. We discuss these findings and offer recommendations for addressing the adverse impacts of departmental identity on staff, patients, and the organization’s ability to meet challenges. This study has clarified sources and impacts of SI in a hospital context. It has also demonstrated the need for a more unified hospital identity to improve the hospital’s daily work and achieve the organization’s goals in a dynamic, competitive environment. Most literature on social identity has addressed personal- and group-level antecedents of social identity, neglecting the potential participation of in-group and out-group management in shaping these identities, as well as management’s contribution to the achievement or nonachievement of organizational goals. By adopting a qualitative approach, the current study provides a deeper understanding of how senior management and direct in-group management can shape social identities—a perspective heretofore missing from the research. Recognizing these identity-shaping forces is essential for understanding the challenges that hospitals face, and the various (at times, life-or-death) consequences of these forces. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Despite increasing efforts to implement legislative gender quotas, many countries still encounter substantial popular opposition to this policy. Previous work cannot explain why opposition to legislative gender quotas persists, particularly among young men, a group believed to be open to diversity. We develop and test a theoretical framework linking group threat to men's attitudes toward legislative gender quotas. While the salience of perceived group threat could trigger men's opposition to legislative gender quotas, we expect that this effect will be more profound among young men due to the heightened degree of economic insecurity experienced by younger generations. Using original survey experiments in South Korea, this study demonstrates the strong influence of group threat in the formation of negative attitudes toward legislative gender quotas among young men. These effects, however, are not mediated by traditional gender norms. Our findings have significant implications for the study of gender and politics and democratic representation. © 2022 Washington University in St. Louis

AB  - Tremendous efforts will be required in the coming decades to limit the harmful effects of climate change. This includes travel behavior, which not only has a significant impact on climate but also affects the perceived justice and trust necessary to manage the transition to net zero successfully. Technologies such as social media can promote behavioral change; unfortunately, also for the negative. Drawing on social comparison theory, social identity theory, and the theory of planned behavior, this study uses a PLS-SEM model to investigate if and under which circumstances exposure to travel-related content posted by professional influencers affects their followers’ travel intentions. It extends previous studies by explicitly focusing on influencers that use Instagram to make a living and considers the effect of pro-environmental attitudes. On the one hand, it shows that influencers are not only responsible for their travel behavior. Their content stimulates their audiences’ wanderlust through benign envy. On the other hand, the study suggests that reinforcing pro-environmental attitudes can help mitigate the negative climate effects of imitating influencer travel behavior. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - This paper examines discriminatory attitudes of Israeli Jews towards non-Jewish immigrants admitted into Israel under the Law of Return. We looked at three spheres of discrimination: admission, political rights, and welfare rights and focused on the role of realistic socioeconomic and symbolic threats in the emergence of discriminatory attitudes. We used a mixed-methods approach that allowed to test our hypotheses among a representative sample (survey) and examine the logics underlying the respondents’ justifications for endorsing discrimination (focus groups/in-depth interviews). The findings show that discrimination endorsement is strongest in the case of admission and political rights where Israeli Jews seek to prevent the presence of outgroups and deny them the right to become part of the society. By contrast, discrimination with respect to welfare rights is less pronounced–possibly because it is not viewed as awarding membership in society, but rather providing individuals their basic needs based on universalistic or democratic values. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Deprovincialization is a set of attitudes characterized by two sides: a nuanced and fresh perspective on the in-group culture and an open and accepting attitude toward other groups. After reviewing early research and indirect tests of the construct, we focused our attention on research investigating these two sides of deprovincialization. Studies conducted in various countries demonstrate that deprovincialization as in-group cultural nuance is a strong and reliable correlate of reduced prejudice and improved intergroup relations; moreover, it is distinct from both national identification and cultural relativism. Studies conducted in Italy show that deprovincialization as openness toward other groups is related to positive intergroup contact and intergroup harmony and has longitudinal negative effects on prejudice. Importantly, in both lines of research the beneficial role of deprovincialization goes beyond the effects of constructs such as social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, nationalism, and demographic variables. We conclude by proposing suggestions for future research and highlighting relevant issues to be considered in policy development and implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This was a retrospective hospital-based cohort study of participants diagnosed with lung cancer in the lung cancer register database, and our goal was to evaluate the impact of smoking and screening status on lung cancer characteristics and clinical outcomes. According to the hospital-based lung cancer register database, a total of 2883 lung cancers were diagnosed in 2883 patients between January 2007 and September 2017, which were divided into four groups according to smoking and screening status. A comparison was performed in terms of clinical characteristics and outcomes of lung cancer between the four groups. For non-smokers, age, gender, screened status, tumor size, targeted therapy, and curative surgery were independent prognostic factors of overall survival for lung cancer subjects. However, screened status and gender were not significant prognostic factors for lung cancer survival in smokers with lung cancer. For the non-smoker group, about 4.9% of lung cancer subjects (N = 81) were detected by screening. However, only 0.97% of lung cancer subjects (N = 12) were detected by screening in smokers. This could be attributed to smokers’ negative attitudes and low socioeconomic status preventing LDCT lung cancer screening. In summary, our real-world data suggest that effectively encouraging smokers to be more willing to participate in lung cancer screening programs with screening allowance and educational training in the future is an important issue. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Digital (consumer) services, such as ticket machines, self-checkout, and online reservations, have become increasingly important in modern society. Studies on adoption of these services and openness to using future public digital services (e.g., online voting, online taxes, electronic patient records) have mostly focused on younger adults or nonrepresentative samples among older adults. Therefore, two important questions remain that can best be addressed with representative sampling: To what extent do older adults use or are willing to use current and future digital services in their everyday lives? How do older adults evaluate the ease of use of these services?. The study included data on use of current and future digital services among a large Swiss sample of 1149 people age 65 years and older (mean age: 74.1 years, SD: 6.69). Descriptive and multivariate analyses showed that (a) established services such as cash machines were used more often than new services, such as self-checkout apps or machines. (b) Perceived ease of use is related to age, socioeconomic status, health, and interest in technology. (c) Only 8.9% had an overall positive attitude toward these digital services, and this attitude was predicted by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and interest in technology. (d) Participants were more often open to filing taxes online than voting online, and openness was predicted by age, income, and interest in technology. Today, mainly older adults with a high interest in technology use digital services. Nevertheless, potential for greater use is evident. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Newcomers to Ireland confront a context of reception shaped by large-scale historical emigration and more recent immigration defined by an increasingly diverse set of origin contexts, both within and outside the European Union (EU). How has the Irish population responded to these groups, and how openly do Irish residents express their views toward different immigrant groups? We test this response using a survey experiment, which offered respondents an anonymous way to express any negative attitudes to immigrant groups they may have had. Results from the survey experiment show that Irish residents’ support for Black and Polish immigrations is overstated when expressed directly. In contrast, their sentiment toward Muslim immigrants is notably insensitive to the level of anonymity provided, indicating little difference between overt and covert expression of support (or antipathy). In other words, when race/ethnicity or EU origin is made salient, Irish respondents are more likely to mask negative sentiment. When Islam is emphasized, however, Irish antipathy is not masked. We find that in-group preferences, instead of determining support in an absolute sense, shape the reluctance with which opposition to immigrant groups is overtly expressed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Currently, the transition to a circular economy is becoming a development trend of many countries around the world to cope with climate change and reduce carbon emissions. Vietnam is also one of the countries in the process of taking steps to transition to a circular economy. However, to make a successful transition to a circular economy, citizen participation is essential. Thus, the question is, are people ready to participate in the circular economy? Therefore, this study surveyed 431 people regarding their willingness to participate in the circular economy based on the theory of planned behavior and the structural equation model. The results of empirical research have shown that the factors attention to the environment, and attitude towards intention are the factors that have a strong impact on willingness to participate in the circular economy. Based on the given influencing factors, the authors make some policy suggestions for the Vietnamese government in the transition to a circular economy. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: Validated knowledge–attitude–practice (KAP) questionnaires are essential to design and evaluate intervention programs on antibiotic use. Recently, we validated the first KAP questionnaire on antibiotics in Spain. Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of research tools increase their universal usefulness. Here, we aimed to validate the questionnaire in a developing country with different socioeconomic characteristics from that of Spain. Methods: We translated the previously developed KAP-questionnaire into Arabic and French, tailored it and then validated it in adult population in Lebanon. The item content validity index (I-CVI), scale content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) and modified Kappa (k*) were calculated. The construct validity of the questionnaire was evaluated using confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA, N = 1460) and its reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC, N = 100) and Cronbach’s alpha statistic. Results: ICV-I (>0.78), k* (equal to ICV-I for all items) and S-CVI/Ave (≥0.95) confirmed the questionnaire content validity. Pilot testing (N = 40) and face validity showed the understandability of the questionnaire by the population. Test–retest reliability analysis (N = 100) yielded ICC ≥ 0.59 for all knowledge and attitude items, showing the capacity of the questionnaire to generate reproducible results. CFA evidenced adequate fit of the chosen model, thus establishing the construct validity of the questionnaire (root mean squared error approximation = 0.053, standardized root mean square residual = 0.045, comparative fit index = 0.92 and Tucker–Lewis index = 0.90). The questionnaire showed an acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.62) and was highly accepted in Lebanon (response rate = 96% and item response rates ≥ 94%). Conclusions: The validity of the KAP-questionnaire on antibiotics in Arabic and French was demonstrated in Lebanon. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Previous literature demonstrates correlations between comorbidities and failure to complete adjuvant chemotherapy. Frailty and socioeconomic disparities have also been implicated in affecting cancer treatment outcomes. This study examines the effect of demographics, comorbidities, frailty, and socioeconomic status on chemotherapy completion rates in colorectal cancer patients. Methods: This was an observational case-control study using retrospective data from Stage II and III colorectal cancer patients offered chemotherapy between January 01, 2013 and January 01, 2018. Data was obtained using the cancer registry, supplemented with chart review. Patients were divided based on treatment completion and compared with respect to comorbidities, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, and insurance status using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: 228 patients were identified: 53 Stage II and 175 Stage III. Of these, 24.5% of Stage II and 30.3% of Stage III patients did not complete chemotherapy. Neither ECOG status nor any comorbidity predicted failure to complete treatment. Those failing to complete chemotherapy were older (64.4 vs 60.8 years, P =.043). Additionally, those with public assistance or self-pay were less likely to complete chemotherapy than those with private insurance (P =.049). Both factors (older age/insurance status) remained significant on multivariate analysis (increasing age at diagnosis: OR 1.03, P =.034; public insurance: OR 1.84, P =.07; and self-pay status: OR 4.49, P =.03). Conclusions: No comorbidity was associated with failure to complete therapy, nor was frailty, as assessed by ECOG score. Though frailty was not significant, increasing age was, possibly reflecting negative attitudes toward chemotherapy in older populations. Insurance status also predicted failure to complete treatment, suggesting disparities in access to treatment, affected by socioeconomic factors. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The Internet, specifically social media, is among the most common settings where young people encounter hate speech. Understanding their attitudes toward the phenomenon is crucial for combatting it because acceptance of such content could contribute to furthering the spread of hate speech as well as ideology contamination. The present study, theoretically grounded in the General Aggression Model (GAM), investigates factors associated with online hate acceptance among young adults. We collected survey data from participants aged 18–26 from six countries: Finland (n = 483), France (n = 907), Poland (n = 738), Spain (n = 739), the United Kingdom (n = 959), and the United States (n = 1052). Results based on linear regression modeling showed that acceptance of online hate was strongly associated with acceptance of violence in all samples. In addition, participants who admitted to producing online hate reported higher levels of acceptance of it. Moreover, association with social dominance orientation was found in most of the samples. Other sample-specific significant factors included participants’ experiences with the Internet and online hate, as well as empathy and institutional trust levels. Significant differences in online hate acceptance levels and the strength of its connections to individual factors were found between the countries. These results provide important insights into the phenomenon, demonstrating that online hate acceptance is part of a larger belief system and is influenced by cultural background, and, therefore, it cannot be analyzed or combatted in isolation from these factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Pacific Islanders living in Hawai‘i with ancestral ties to islands in the western Pacific region of Micronesia are common targets of uninhibited forms of prejudice in multiple sectors, including healthcare. Whether the explicit societal-level attitudes toward this group are reflected in implicit attitudes among healthcare providers is unknown; therefore, we designed a pilot study to investigate this question. Our study measures implicit racial bias toward Pacific Islanders from Micronesia among Obstetrician-Gynecologists (OB-GYNs) in Hawai‘i. Methods: We developed 4 new implicit association tests (IATs) to measure implicit attitudes and associations (i.e., stereotypes) toward Pacific Islanders from Micronesia in 2 conditions: (1) Micronesians vs. Whites and (2) Micronesians vs. Japanese Americans. Participants were practicing OB-GYNs in Hawai‘i. The study was conducted online and included survey questions on demographic and physician practice characteristics in addition to IATs. The primary outcome was the mean IAT D score. Associations between IAT D scores and demographic and practice characteristics were also analyzed. Results: Of the 49 OB-GYNs, 38 (77.6%) were female, mean age was 40 years, 29.5% were Japanese, 22.7% were White, and none were from a Micronesian ethnic group. The mean IAT D score in the Micronesian vs. White condition (N = 29) was 0.181, (SD: 0.465, p < 0.05) for the Attitude IAT and 0.197 (SD: 0.427; p < 0.05) for the Stereotype IAT. Conclusion: The findings from this pilot suggest a slight degree of implicit bias favoring Whites over Micronesians within this sample of OB-GYNs and warrant a larger investigation into implicit biases toward this unique and understudied Pacific Islander population. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Using data from a national sample, I examine Blacks’ feelings of closeness toward Asians in the United States. More specifically, I explore the following: (1) perceived closeness toward Asians, (2) correlates of perceived closeness, and (3) ethnic and national/cultural origin differences in perceived closeness. Results show that feelings of closeness toward Asians are rather similar between African Americans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Spanish-speaking Caribbeans, Trinidadians, and other English-speaking Caribbeans. Ethnic subgroup regression analyses reveal several interesting findings. Only among African Americans, everyday discrimination was negatively associated with feelings of closeness toward Asians. Living in the Northeast was positively correlated with perceived closeness toward Asians. Living in the Midwest, being married, financial strain, and higher educational attainment were correlates of closeness toward Asians only among Black Caribbeans. For Blacks overall, having immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago was positively correlated with feelings of closeness toward Asians compared to native-born Blacks. While being female and everyday discrimination decreased feelings of closeness, positive Black group evaluation and higher religiosity levels increased feelings of closeness. Considering the growing diversity within the Black population in the United States to assess Black-Asian relations, these findings identify several correlates of their felt closeness toward Asians. These results can improve our understanding of Black-Asian relations more broadly, which is especially crucial given the unique dynamic between these two racial groups and ongoing perception of Black-Asian conflict. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Two studies (N1 = 193; N2 = 598) were conducted in Poland to examine the role of two types of ingroup commitment (i.e., national narcissism and national identification) as predictors of attitudes towards immigrants and refugees (disadvantaged groups) and intentions to engage in collective action against them. As predicted, national narcissism (but not national identification) was related to more hostile intergroup attitudes and greater willingness to engage in collective action against refugees and immigrants. The positive effect of national narcissism on intentions to engage in collective action against immigrants and refugees was mediated by attitudes towards those groups. These results show that applying a more fine-grained approach to ingroup commitment (e.g., national narcissism vs. national identification) among advantaged group members allows for a better understanding of their intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions to actively oppose the rights of disadvantaged social groups via collective action. © 2021

AB  - Non-conventional terrorism (NCT) incorporates an extended dimension of uncertainty that can lead to fear among the public. Health officials have an unsubstantiated assumption that thousands will seek treatment in hospitals following NCT. This study aims to examine public behavioral intentions in the case of NCT and the effect of risk communication on intents. An online randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1802 adult participants in Israel. Threat perception and behavioral intent before and after exposure to hypothetical NCT scenarios were assessed stratified to the type of media, exposure to rumors, and risk communication. The majority (~64%) of participants are aware of the NCT threat. Almost half (45%) of participants indicated a “high” or “very high” chance of seeking medical attention following an NCT incident. Regression analysis suggests that the odds of participants exposed to risk communication to report an elevated intent of seeking medical attention were 0.470 (95% CI: 0.359, 0.615) times that of participants not exposed to risk communication, χ2 = 30.366, p &lt; 0.001. The findings demonstrate the importance of effective risk communication in reducing undesired public behavior during NCT crises. Efforts must be invested to create a robust risk communication infrastructure to allow the proper management of possible NCT incidents. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Worldwide, women are more likely to be obese than men, but research on the mechanism of the gender gap in obesity is relatively lacking. This article uses five rounds of Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) data from 2010 to 2017 to empirically test the impact of gender role attitudes on obesity and the gender gap and to explore the mechanism. The main results show that the traditional gender role attitude will improve the probability of obesity in women, but it will not positively impact obesity in men. Using the proportion of “March 8th red flag bearer” at the provincial level as an instrumental variable to alleviate the possible estimation errors caused by omitted variables, the results show that the lower the proportion of red flag bearers, the higher the probability of obesity of women, and still will not improve the probability of obesity of men. The robustness test based on the generalized propensity score method (GPSM) supports the above results. The mechanism analysis shows that economic status and market participation are two essential mechanisms of gender role attitudes and female obesity. Traditional gender role attitudes increase the risk of women's obesity by reducing their economic status and labour market participation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is posing a threat to people all across the globe. According to traditional literature, threat perceptions induce anti-immigrant sentiments, as ingroup identity and self-interest are strengthened at the expense of the outgroup. In this study, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic indeed increases anti-immigrant sentiments, or that this type of threat elicits other or no group related responses. We also look at whether such responses are expressed more strongly among specific subgroups in Dutch society. To do so, we use unique longitudinal panel data based on the European Values Study 2017, with a repeated measure in May 2020, during the national 'intelligent lockdown' in the Netherlands. Based on structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that anti-immigrant sentiments have not increased due to (perceived threat of) the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, negative opinions towards immigrants decreased between 2017 and 2020 in the Netherlands, for which we provide alternative explanations. Although some subgroups do experience more threat than others due to the coronavirus, such as women, first generation immigrants, and the elderly, this does not lead to more negative feelings towards outgroups. Whether this is due to the fact that individuals feel threatened by everyone, regardless of group membership, should be explored in future research. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Citing the black family as the locus of responsibility for black disadvantage has a long history in the United States; however, only limited research has examined the place of family upbringing in studies of Americans’ beliefs about the causes of racial inequality. Methods: We use data from the 2010, 2012, and 2014 General Social Surveys (GSS) to examine the prevalence and selected correlates of a newly offered (by the GSS) and culturally centered explanation of the black/white socioeconomic status gap focusing on “differences in upbringing.”. Results: The “upbringing” explanation is the most popular of the five reasons offered by the GSS in all three waves of data available for examination. Three-quarters of GSS respondents endorse this view, while less than half endorse the next most popular explanation. Upbringing is also the most popular explanation among all three race/ethnic groups we examine, though non-Hispanic whites endorse this view most strongly. Conclusion: Our results offer important insights for future survey design and investigations of public beliefs about racial inequality. © 2021 by the Southwestern Social Science Association.

AB  - Objective: Interracial interactions are often fraught with concerns about experiencing discrimination or being negatively stereotyped (i.e., social identity threat). Past research revealed that Black participantsinteracting with a White partner view the presence of racial diversity in a White partner’s friendshipnetwork as a signal of identity safety. We extend this work by clarifying the role of ingrouprepresentation in friendship diversity. Namely, we assess social identity safety of Black participantswhen anticipating an interaction with aWhite partner whose friendship networks include diversity withor without ingroup representation. Method: In an experimental study (N = 301), Black adults (52.8%female, 47.2% male; Mage = 29.96) expected to interact with aWhite partner who had all White friends(No Diversity); Black and White friends (Diversity with Ingroup Representation); or Asian, Latinx, andWhite friends (Diversity without Ingroup Representation). We assessed participants’ perceptions oftheir White partner as prejudiced, how they expected their partner would think of them (Blackmetastereotypes), and their anticipated interaction challenges, rejection concerns, and friendshipinterest immediately prior to the anticipated interaction. Results: Black participants had feweranticipated challenges, fewer rejection concerns, and more friendship interest when their Whitepartner’s friendship networks included (vs. excluded) ingroup representation. These effects weremediated by perceived partner prejudice and Black metastereotypes. Conclusions: These findingssuggest that while any diversity of an outgroup member’s friendship network is better than no diversity,ingroup representation is especially important in reducing threat and increasing social identity safety ininterracial interactions © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Objectives: Along with mistrust toward politics and journalism, the pandemic is amplifying mistrust in healthcare. To explore trust in key professionals among the Italian population, we focused on perceived change in trust during the pandemic. Study design: Nationwide online cross-sectional survey (called COCOS). Methods: COCOS was conducted in Italy in two periods: the end of the first lockdown (T1: April–May 2020) and the end of 2020 (T2: November–December 2020). Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were performed (sample size = 2673). Results: Trust in healthcare workers (HCWs) was reduced in 1.5% of participants (T1) and 2.8% (T2). Trust in scientists/researchers was reduced in 5.8% (T1) and 7.6% (T2). Trust in politicians was reduced in 37.6% (T1) and 52.3% (T2). Trust in journalists was reduced in 41.7% (T1) and 48.3% (T2). Considering multivariable models, participants of the second period, participants who were HCWs, participants with anxiety symptoms, and those experiencing economic struggle due to the pandemic had a higher likelihood of having a reduced trust. The period had the strongest association with reduced trust. Conclusions: We argue that a central role might be played by the pandemic fatigue. We suggest leading figures should be more aware of the relationship between communication and trust. The pandemic is a real-world experiment in reshaping mediated communication and, although social media play an important role, other approaches might be successful. As a notable part of the population is trusting politicians and media less and less, Italian key professionals should implement initiatives to reinvigorate public support. © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - Whom do individuals blame for intergroup conflict? Do people attribute responsibility for intergroup conflict to the in-group or the out-group? Theoretically integrating the literatures on intergroup relations, moral psychology, and judgment and decision-making, we propose that unpacking a group by explicitly describing it in terms of its constituent subgroups increases perceived support for the view that the unpacked group shoulders more of the blame for intergroup conflict. Five preregistered experiments (N = 3,335 adults) found support for this novel hypothesis across three distinct intergroup conflicts: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, current racial tensions between White people and Black people in the United States, and the gender gap in wages in the United States. Our findings (a) highlight the independent roles that entrenched social identities and cognitive, presentation-based processes play in shaping blame judgments, (b) demonstrate that the effect of unpacking groups generalizes across partisans and nonpartisans, and (c) illustrate how constructing packed versus unpacked sets of potential perpetrators can critically shape where the blame lies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Low family income during childhood is associated with multiple enduring negative outcomes, including poorer cognitive functioning in adulthood. However, mechanisms linking low family income during adolescence to adulthood cognitive outcomes are relatively unclear, as mediators of income-cognition links have mostly been examined separately. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal multiple mediation analysis of associations between adolescent family income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory using a large, national dataset (N = 6337). The data were sociodemographically representative of the United States (48.1% male, Madult age=29.01). Potential mediators were education attainment, family education attitudes, stressful life experiences, inflammation, and perceived parental warmth. We found that education attainment mediated the associations between adolescent income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory. Additionally, stressful life events mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood long-term memory, whereas inflammation and family education attitudes mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood working memory. These findings suggest that limited education, less positive attitudes toward education, more stress, and heightened inflammation in low-income families predict poorer cognition in adulthood, and that intervening on each of these factors may mitigate detrimental cognitive sequelae of low family income during adolescence. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we explore Mexican and Central American migrants’ decisions to refuse public benefits in response to the Trump administration’s proposed change in the enforceability priorities of the “public charge” section of the Immigration and Naturalization Act. Based on interviews with migrants who have experienced undocumented status and who are now in the process of becoming lawful permanent residents, we argue that decisions to pre-emptively forego public welfare benefits beginning in 2018 were not simply based on an impulsive fear-based reaction, but rather on thoughtful considerations around the human impact of immigration policies. We conceptualize migrant refusals of public benefits through the framework of what we call cultivated intuition because while these refusals are visceral responses, they are also educated inferences about how the fundamental logics of conditional citizenship within the US immigration system work to regulate migrant mobility and behaviour both at the border and within the nation-state. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Identifying ways to effectively communicate about racial/ethnic disparities is a place where communication scholars can make vital contributions. Yet, existing studies on this subject are scarce. Borrowing from reactance theory and the 3D model of White identity management, the present study tested whether exposing White adults to White privilege messaging helps them to become more aware or deny racial privilege. The results of our experiment revealed that there was a main effect for reading about racial privilege and increased awareness of privilege. However, in keeping with reactance theory, if the message stoked a perceived threat to freedom, message exposure resulted in the denial of both blatant and institutional racism. We also found a moderating role for Fox News viewing such that awareness of racial privilege was not affected by the intervention for heavy Fox News viewers, but it was for low Fox News viewers. We conclude that messages focused on explaining White privilege are promising, but there are risks. © 2021 Mass Communication & Society Division of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of caregivers of people with dementia towards the disease (Alzheimer disease). The secondary objective of the study was to assess the association of attitude and knowledge towards dementia. Methods: In total, 50 patients with dementia and their caregivers were included in the present study. Caregivers were evaluated on the Dementia Attitude Scale and Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS) to assess the level of knowledge and attitude. Results: The mean age of patients was 72.2 years, and the majority of them were men, married, from joint/extended family setup, urban background, and upper or upper-middle socioeconomic status. The mean age of the caregivers was 48.04 years, and the majority was educated more than the matric level. Nearly half of the caregivers were children, and about one-third were the spouse of the person with dementia. The mean duration of the caregiver role was 3.6 ± 3.0 years, while the average time spent in caregiving was 7.4 ± 2.9 h/day. Using the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale, the mean knowledge score for the caregivers was 16.9 ± 2.7. In terms of individual items on the knowledge scale, most of the caregivers were aware of most aspects of dementia. In terms of the mean weighted score, the maximum score was for the domains of course and symptoms and this was followed by the domain of “treatment and management.” The lowest score was obtained for the domain of assessment and diagnosis on ADKS. On the Dementia Attitude Scale, the mean total score was 76.4 ± 18.4. The mean total score for the knowledge domain was higher than the support domain. Conclusion: The current study suggests that most caregivers with dementia have a reasonable level of knowledge about dementia. However, in terms of attitude, caregivers of people with dementia have a less positive attitude towards dementia. The study's finding suggests that there is a need to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of the caregivers of people with dementia and the gaps must be addressed to improve the outcome, both for the people with dementia and their caregivers.

AB  - This article explores why and how the British and Australian authorities monitored their British Cypriot communities and how this impacted upon their respective immigration policies in connection with British Cypriots. Both the British and Australian authorities monitored sections of the British Cypriot community for similar reasons, especially political, using similar techniques, yet adopted different immigration policies on more Cypriots arriving. While the historiography for this period claims that the British were moving towards restricting immigration from their Empire and Australia was opening its borders, the opposite is in fact the case for the British Cypriots. The British did not alter their policies or procedures very much on the immigration of Cypriots from the 1930s, and even opened their border to Cypriot informers during the EOKA period. On the other hand, the Australian authorities progressively placed restrictions on Cypriots until they suspended immigration in 1956. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Does international terrorism affect attitudes toward refugees? Does terrorism mobilize the public to pressure legislators to restrict refugee policy? Are these effects long-or short-lived? To answer these questions, this article presents results from a large-scale natural experiment to investigate the effects of the 2015 Islamic State terrorist attacks in Paris on attitudes toward Syrian refugees in a country that is a major recipient of refugees (Canada). The results demonstrate that the attacks increased (1) anxiety over refugee resettlement, (2) perceptions of refugees as a security and cultural threat, and (3) opposition to resettlement. Furthermore, the attacks increased mobilization among resettlement’s opponents. Using a large-scale survey (n p 18; 634) fielded daily across a three-week period, however, we show that these effects were decidedly short-lived. The findings are highly relevant to our understanding of public reactions to major terrorist attacks and the responses of political entrepreneurs in their aftermath. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - When dominant groups are accused of discrimination against non-dominant groups, they often seek to portray themselves as the victims of discrimination instead. Sometimes, however, members of dominant groups counter accusations of discrimination by invoking victimhood on a new dimension of harm, changing the topic being discussed. Across three studies (N = 3081), we examine two examples of this digressive victimhood – Christian Americans responding to accusations of homophobia by claiming threatened religious liberty, and White Americans responding to accusations of racism by claiming threatened free speech. We show that members of dominant groups endorse digressive victimhood claims more strongly than conventional competitive victimhood claims (i.e., ones that claim “reverse discrimination”). Additionally, accounting for the fact that these claims may also stand to benefit a wider range of people and appeal to more abstract principles, we show that this preference is driven by the perception that digressive victimhood claims are more effective at silencing further criticism from the non-dominant group. Underscoring that these claims may be used strategically, we observed that individuals high in outgroup prejudice were willing to express a positive endorsement of the digressive victimhood claims even when they did not fully support the principle they claimed to be defending (e.g., freedom of religion or speech). We discuss implications for real-world intergroup conflicts and the psychology of dominant groups. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - I show that climate skepticism increases with negative economic shocks and that the effects are concentrated among individuals in the labor force. I primarily employ a panel of US individuals in the period following the Great Recession, but also find consistent results with an alternative instrumental variables strategy. Among labor force participants, a one-percentage point increase in the local unemployment rate leads to a three to five percentage point decrease in the probability of believing climate change is real and requires action. I conclude that support for climate change policies could depend on labor market conditions. © 2021 Western Economic Association International.

AB  - We explore whether fear of apprehension affects immigrants' labor market engagement by examining how Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) removals due to immigration violations and increased awareness of immigration raids impact their labor market outcomes. We find that ICE deportations are associated with reductions in the labor force participation and employment of likely undocumented immigrants when compared to similarly skilled foreign-born US citizens. Effects are particularly strong among women, especially those with children, as well as in industries likely targeted by ICE raids. Controlling for perceived threats and de jure immigration policies has little impact on these results. © 2021 Western Economic Association International.

AB  - Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political views of the two biggest US multiracial groups—White-Asians and White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes. Leveraging the largest national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely to benefit the Democratic Party. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Measuring public opinions about the police is a mainstay of police–community relations because the police need to know how well they are doing in the communities they serve. To understand public attitudes toward the police in the aftermath of George’s Floyd’s killing, we analyze data from residents across seven cities located in Southeast Virginia. We find that, compared to whites and other racial groups, blacks were more likely to report both personal and vicarious experiences and were less trusting of and satisfied with police. In addition, blacks were less likely than whites and other racial groups to support the police’s handling of peaceful protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Other demographic differences are found and presented in light of prior research on public attitudes toward the police. The implications of our findings for improved police–community interactions, policy, and future research are discussed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To explore the interrelationship between terrorist acts, terrorist ethnicity, and observer gender and cultural background in Israel, we recruited 211 participants aged 19–75 years. The majority were male (63%). As for the ethnic and religious cultural background, 40% were Jewish, 40% Druze, and 20% Muslim. The participants answered questions about their demographic characteristics, read three scenarios of terrorist acts, addressed attitudes toward terrorists, and suggested the length of imprisonment. We manipulated the type of act (shooting and killing/burning religious institutions/throwing stones at cars) and terrorist ethnicity (Arab/ Jewish). The results indicate significant main effects of the manipulated variables regarding attitudes toward terrorists. Also, Muslim Arab participants expressed more negative attitudes in cases of Jewish terrorists than Arab terrorists, whereas Jewish participants expressed more negative attitudes toward Arab terrorists than Jewish terrorists. Druze participants did not differentiate between Arab and Jewish terrorists. Furthermore, in cases of Arab perpetrators, Jewish participants suggested imprisonment terms 2.4 times longer than in cases of Jewish perpetrators. The discussion addresses the findings in the context of social identity theory and dual social identification. Regarding practical implications, the findings imply the need for education and training on ethnic bias among policymakers and practitioners. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Attachment theory emphasizes both the importance of supportive relationship partners, beginning in infancy, for developing a sense of security, and the adaptive benefits of this sense. In this article, we consider bolstering the sense of attachment security as a means of reducing and overcoming prejudice, discrimination, and racism. We review basic concepts of attachment theory, focusing on what we call the broaden-and-build cycle of attachment security. We review studies showing that the sense of attachment security is associated with reduced prejudice and less discriminatory attitudes and behavior toward people outside one’s own social or racial group. Finally, we propose theoretical ideas and research suggesting that attachment security can protect against the adverse psychological effects of others’ acts of prejudice and discrimination toward oneself. We conclude that, despite large gaps in the research literature, attachment theory is a useful conceptual framework for understanding and combatting prejudice, discrimination, and racism. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article attempts to study two different causal mechanisms where education affects individual attitudes toward foreign countries. On the one hand, education stands for human capital and/or skill level. According to the factor endowments model, for example, well-educated people in a capital-abundant country can materially benefit from trade ties with other labor-abundant countries. On the other hand, education cultivates social trust, disseminates information, and expands breadth of social perspective, all of which can make one more pro-outsider. Hence, both explanations tend to predict that one’s educational attainment is associated with a positive opinion of outgroup members and foreigners. By cross-national comparison including both developed and developing economies, I find empirical evidence supporting the socializing not the utilitarian effect of education on outgroup attitudes, using data from the second wave of the Asian Barometer Survey. Further structural equation modeling shows that education socializes an individual to be more internationalist and cosmopolitan mainly through an expanded social perspective. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Context: Medical educators are increasingly paying attention to how bias creates inequities that affect learners across the medical education continuum. Such bias arises from learners' social identities. However, studies examining bias and social identities in medical education tend to focus on one identity at a time, even though multiple identities often interact to shape individuals' experiences. Methods: This article examines prior studies on bias and social identity in medical education, focusing on three social identities that commonly elicit bias: race, gender and profession. By applying the lens of intersectionality, we aimed to generate new insights into intergroup relations and identify strategies that may be employed to mitigate bias and inequities across all social identities. Results: Although different social identities can be more or less salient at different stages of medical training, they intersect and impact learners' experiences. Bias towards racial and gender identities affect learners' ability to reach different stages of medical education and influence the specialties they train in. Bias also makes it difficult for learners to develop their professional identities as they are not perceived as legitimate members of their professional groups, which influences interprofessional relations. To mitigate bias across all identities, three main sets of strategies can be adopted. These strategies include equipping individuals with skills to reflect upon their own and others' social identities; fostering in-group cohesion in ways that recognise intersecting social identities and challenges stereotypes through mentorship; and addressing intergroup boundaries through promotion of allyship, team reflexivity and conflict management. Conclusions: Examining how different social identities intersect and lead to bias and inequities in medical education provides insights into ways to address these problems. This article proposes a vision for how existing strategies to mitigate bias towards different social identities may be combined to embrace intersectionality and develop equitable learning environments for all. © 2021 Association for the Study of Medical Education and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This study explored the association between the perceived presence of immigrants and support for social spending in a non-Western context, particularly Korea, so far relatively under-researched. Using the Korean General Social Survey data, specifically, it analysed whether and how native Koreans' attitudes toward government spending on (each area of) social security are influenced by the perceived presence of immigrant populations in Korean society, and furthermore, whether the degree and direction of the relationship may depend not only on the type of social benefits, but also on the type of immigration, that is, whether the share of certain groups of immigrants in the population is perceived to be high or low. The results suggest that the association between (perceived) immigration and support for social spending exists in Korea, and its degree and direction differs when the types of social benefits and immigration are considered. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The analysis of poverty is not the primary subject-matter of psychology but the way how it is perceived and what consequences it has is traditionally studied in psychology using constructs like attitudes to poverty and the attribution of causes of poverty. The aim of the present study was to examine the attitudes to poverty using a mixed methods perspective, employing Q-methodology and to find out to what extent the findings about the attitude to poverty correspond with the well-known theories on attitudes and attributions of poverty. 50 respondents, aged 19–40, participated in the study, 29 were university students with diverse study focus and 21 were employed of various professions. Respondents sorted 56 statements about poverty, which formed the Q-sort of a quasi-normal distribution in the response matrix. The PQMethod software was used to analyze individual Q-sorts. Factor analysis extracted four factors: Realists, Sympathizers, State facilitators, and Impartial radicals. The resulting differentiation of factors confirms the validity of the hitherto defined conceptualizations of attitudes to poverty and the attribution of causes of poverty; moreover, it allows for a better understanding of individual constructions reflecting the attitudes to poverty. Based on the performed analysis, it can be stated that attitudes to poverty are better viewed not as universal concepts present in the unsorted population but rather in the context of other characteristics of the persons themselves. The socioeconomic status has proven to be an important factor in differentiating attitudes towards poverty. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study aims to simulate the economic and environmental effects of energy-carbon-water (ECW) policies in China. The main novelty works are to clarify the theoretical ECW nexus mechanism at macro-economic level and develop the ECW-CGE policy assessment model with ECW policy modules integrated. Using this model, isolated and integrated ECW policy scenarios are designed and simulated in 2050. Policy effectiveness and co-effects are further discussed. The main findings are: (1) For economic effects, GDP losses grow from 0.31 % in water policy scenario W1 to 1.51 % in integrated policy scenario ECW2. Energy and carbon emission policies cause greater outputs losses in energy and carbon intensive sectors, while water policy impacts stronger on agricultural and service sectors. (2) For environmental effects, integrated policy scenarios reduce the most of ECW, and isolated ones mainly affect their targeted ECW elements. (3) For policy effectiveness, isolated policy scenarios have greater individual effectiveness, integrated ones could balance overall ECW management. (4) Synergy and trade-off effects exist in all scenarios. Governance cooperation and differentiated sectoral policies are needed to realize sustainable development in ECW system. The main findings could inspire ECW management policy makings both for China and countries with similar environmental constraints. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Since the early 1990s, federal and state legislation restricting the residency options of convicted sex offenders has been justified on the basis of protecting vulnerable populations while deterring future criminal opportunities. While many of these policies maintain public support, recent empirical inquiries have begun to question their effectiveness and appropriateness. Using data from registered sex offenders’ residences in three mid-western states, we explore the effect residency restriction laws have on preventing sex offenders from residing within proximal distance to elementary schools. Preliminary results indicate that sex offenders on average do not reside significantly closer or farther away from elementary schools in states with different proximal distance requirements, but that sex offenders reside significantly closer to elementary schools in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status. We conclude that residency restriction policies for sex offenders should be reconsidered in light of these results. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: Estimate public support for prohibiting multiunit housing (MUH) e-cigarette and cigarette use. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Data from an online panel survey. Sample: A Fall 2018 nationally representative sample of 3,415 (99.3% response rate) United States (US) adults 18-64 years old. Measures: Policy support for prohibiting MUH smoking and e-cigarette use, sociodemographics, and tobacco perceptions and behaviors. Analysis: Weighted multivariate logistic regression examined predictors of support for prohibiting 1) cigarette use and 2) e-cigarette use in MUH. Results: Most respondents expressed support for prohibiting smoking (76.9%) and e-cigarette use (74.0%) in MUH. About 17% (n = 588) of the sample lived in MUH, and living in MUH was not predictive of support for either policy. For both cigarette and e-cigarette policies, current smokers (n = 630; OR = 0.44, p < 0.001; OR = 0.59, p < 0.01) and current e-cigarette users (n = 305; OR = 0.42, p < 0.001; OR = 0.22, p < 0.001) had lower odds of support. Notably, while most smokers supported prohibiting cigarette (51.4%) and e-cigarette use in MUH (51.1%), there was less support among current e-cigarette users for prohibiting cigarette (48.1%) and e-cigarette use in MUH (34.5%). Conclusion: Majority support for prohibiting smoking and e-cigarette use in MUH is promising for policy adoption; however, lower support of both policies among e-cigarette users needs to be examined, as increasing use of e-cigarettes may be shifting social norms away from support for smoke free housing policies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Research suggests that American partisans are increasingly distinct in their beliefs. These strengthened partisan feelings extend to economic perceptions—as numerous scholars have shown, there is a substantial gap between the proportion of Democrats and the proportion of Republicans that believe the economy is improving. Here, we examine the extent to which these perceptions have polarized over the past two decades and the degree to which they still respond to objective economic indicators. Exploiting a Gallup time-series, we show that the gap in economic perceptions approximately doubled between 1999 and 2020, and that partisan economic perceptions no longer seem to converge during economic crises. We further demonstrate that the economic perceptions of Democrats and Republicans have polarized relative to Independents and that this polarization is not asymmetric in magnitude. Collectively, these results document the extraordinary rise of perceptual polarization and illustrate that neither Democrats nor Republicans are immune to its effects. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Many societies today are organised as race-based social hierarchies, with clear boundaries between racial groups at the top versus bottom. The growth of multiracial populations has been heralded as holding the potential to blur existing group boundaries. But whether multiracial people do blur boundaries depends critically on how monoracial perceivers categorise them. We review our research programme on how monoracial perceivers’ categorisation of multiracials depends on sociopolitical motives. We present the Sociopolitical Motive × Intergroup Threat Model of Racial Categorisation, which describes how sociopolitical motives interact with specific threats to drive multiracial categorisation, and how this depends on perceivers’ group position in the racial status hierarchy. Our empirical work is based on the U.S. context, but we discuss how our research, grounded in theories of intergroup relations that have been tested cross-culturally–social dominance, system justification, authoritarianism, and social identity theories–may apply more broadly. © 2021 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This study investigates whether the declining economic performance and social status of traditional news media, which are two dimensions indicating the professional disruption of journalism, are associated with journalists’ engagement in public relations (PR). The results of a cross-sectional survey reveal two paths to the PR-journalism boundary crossing, although the level of boundary crossing is overall controllable. First, economic disruption indirectly predicts journalists’ engagement in media pitching and media event planning through their identification with colleagues who have engaged in PR. Second, perceived waning social status both directly and indirectly predicts their engagement in media pitching and media catching, with their disidentification with PR practitioners as a mediator in the indirect relationship. These findings suggest that, while professional disruption may induce journalists to seek more information subsidy, their professional identity can be a source of both resistance against and support for this trend. Theories on social identity and intergroup relations are adopted to explain this dilemma. © 2021 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - Former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory defied expectations. Trump was an unconventional candidate, and his presidency was true to form. What accounts for his popularity? Integrating work on narcissism with the dual-process motivational model of ideology, we propose that individuals higher in narcissism are more likely to adopt right-wing authoritarian and social-dominance oriented attitudes, which lead them to embrace socially and economically conservative policy positions, respectively. Thus, they are receptive to Trump’s anti-immigration stance, a centerpiece of his political messaging from the campaign trail to the White House. The present study (N = 302) yielded results consistent with this analysis: Right-wing authoritarianism and social-dominance orientation mediated the association between narcissism and Trump support, via social and economic conservatism and immigration attitudes. The study represents an initial test of a potentially generative framework on which future research can elaborate. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic is disrupting the international political economy unlike any event since WWII. Consequently, France reversed years of fiscal consolidation by instating, at least temporarily, a costly emergency furlough scheme reaching a third of the workforce. This provides a natural setting to investigate a potential ‘critical juncture’, and whether the French public still accepts austerity politics today, as it seems to have after the Global Financial Crisis. We observe crisis narratives’ salience across social classes, employing an original quantitative approach for Critical Political Economy, which uses panel data and two experiments. We test if citizens’ viewpoints are sensitive to the trade-off between health and economics, receptive to austerity and conditioned by their socioeconomic status. We find that public opinion shifted after an authoritative and dire economic forecast at the pandemic’s first peak in April 2020, but that acquiescence to austerity did not occur during the phase-out of the first lockdown in June, with the exception of the upper class. Overall, public support favours increased social spending, and pro-austerity crisis narratives might not shape the majority’s ‘common sense’, as they had after the GFC. We conclude with implications for the study of class and public policy in a post-pandemic world. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This attitudinal study examines racism–conceptualized as a general belief in a hierarchical order of racial/ethnic groups–from a comparative cross-national perspective. The study develops theoretical arguments regarding individual and country-level explanations of racist views and tests them using ESS data. It demonstrates that racist views are not rare in Europe, yet their extent varies substantially across countries. In societies with lower levels of social cohesion, citizens are more likely to adopt racist views, as compared to societies with higher levels of social cohesion. Although a country’s economic inequality is not associated with the prevalence of racist views, inequality does seem to condition the impact of gender on such views. In more economically unequal countries, the gender gap in racist views–where men express higher levels of racist views–is greater than in more economically equal countries. No association between ethnic diversity and levels of racist views was found. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In recent years, farmer-led irrigation development has gained the interest of development partners and governments in the Global South following its success in enhancing agricultural production and livelihoods in South Asia. However, little is known about the socio-economic situation of farmers who receive public support for its expansion. Considering its rapid expansion in sub-Saharan Africa, we take the case of Ethiopia and explore the relationship between irrigation suitability and farmers’ socio-economic status. We find that high-value crop producers and wealthier farmers are most likely to make private investments and also benefit from public support in farmer-led irrigation expansion if investments are directed to land areas highly suitable for irrigation. Cultivation of high-value crops (fruit, vegetables) was common in areas more suitable for irrigation but staple crop cultivation (cereals, legumes) was negatively associated with irrigation suitability. Wealth status (consumption expenditure, asset index, and land size) was also positively correlated with irrigation suitability. A 10 per cent increase in groundwater irrigation suitability score was associated with a 2 per cent increase in per-capita consumption expenditure. Results imply that policies aiming to facilitate farmer-led irrigation development should combine biophysical information on land and water suitability for irrigation with household socio-economic characteristics and existing agricultural systems. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The social identity tradition has not reached a consensus regarding the question of whether identifying with an ingroup directly leads to ingroup bias, or whether this association may be moderated by group norms. One previous study (Jetten, Spears, & Manstead, 1997) showed that an ingroup norm of fairness as opposed to differentiation seems to moderate this link between identification and ingroup bias. The present research aims to examine the extent to which real-life group members (Kurds and Turks) with a history of conflict engage in ingroup bias as a function of their level of identification when group norms prescribe favoritism or equality. In Study 1, Kurdish and Turkish participants report their ingroup norm (egalitarianism or favoritism) and allocate a fixed amount of funds between Kurds and Turks in a hypothetical situation. The results show a significant interaction between social identification and group norm on ingroup bias. Accordingly, ingroup bias increases with the strength of identification when the norm is favoritism; however, there is no relationship when the norm is egalitarianism. Study 2 manipulates the ingroup norm for Kurdish and Turkish participants in the same hypothetical context. This time, the interaction is marginally significant but in a similar direction, where stronger identification leads to higher ingroup bias in the favoritism norm condition, yet this effect disappears in the egalitarianism norm condition. These findings extend the literature on the role of norms in intergroup relations, emphasizing the important role of egalitarian norms in reducing ingroup bias even in real-life conflict-ridden contexts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We compared the differences and explored the associations between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity, and the intergroup attitudes of adolescents from the Yi, Han, and Mongolian ethnicities in a Yi ethnic autonomous region in China. The participants (N = 1830, 50% female) were middle school students (n = 910, M age = 13.51) and high school students (n = 920, M age = 17.71). We found (a) significant ethnic differences between the high school students in the subscales of behavior, self-identification, and achievement; (b) that the three ethnic groups exhibited nonsignificant differences in their perceptions of Chinese national identity; (c) a positive association between ethnic identity and Chinese national identity for the adolescents across ethnicities; (d) a positive association between ethnic identity and intergroup attitudes for the Yi adolescents only; and (e) that Chinese national identity was positively associated with intergroup attitudes for the Yi and Han adolescents and for the Mongolian middle school students, but not for the Mongolian high school students. This suggests that age and context play central roles in shaping the ethnic and national identities of adolescents in such regions, and those who grow up in an inclusive environment are more likely to develop positive intergroup attitudes. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In this article, I explore how much of White Americans' opposition to immigration—opposition that is often grounded in fears of the threat that immigration poses to the robustness of America's national identity—is shaped by ethnonationalism, a set of beliefs concerning which traits are important for being a “true” American. Drawing on data from the 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES), I examine how ethnonationalism shapes White Americans' attitudes towards immigrants. I find that ethnonationalism is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes among Whites, with the effect size of my ethnonationalism measure being larger than that of any other variable in my ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model. Critically, this includes a number of variables that are already known to be strongly predictive of White attitudes towards immigration, such as Republican partisanship. Beyond anti-immigrant attitudes, I also find that ethnonationalism also predicts support for policies that would restriction immigration. © 2021 The Author.

AB  - There is still little research about the association of anti-immigrant attitudes with ethnic discrimination. In this study we investigate whether there is more rental discrimination against ethnic minorities in Belgian municipalities with more negative attitudes and higher perceived threats toward immigration and refugees. For this purpose, we merged unique data from correspondence tests with the aggregated attitudes in 44 municipalities. There was profound discrimination against candidates with Moroccan names by both private landlords and realtors. In contrast to theoretical expectations there was not more ethnic discrimination in municipalities with more negative attitudes or higher perceived threats. However, it appears that rental candidates–irrespective of their ethnic origin–are less likely to be invited in municipalities with higher threats and more negative attitudes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In one large-scale experiment using U.S. respondents on Mechanical Turk (N = 2,899), we studied how subtle differences in framing and context impacted estimates of the Black–White wealth gap. Across our 10 different experimental manipulations of framing and context, respondents consistently overestimated Black family wealth relative to White wealth. There was also substantial variation in the magnitude of these wealth estimates, which ranged from a low of 35 to a high of over 60 percentage points across the conditions. Overestimates were largest when respondents were asked about the Black–White wealth gap at both past and present time points and closest to accuracy when respondents used images as pictorial comparisons for White and Black wealth. Overall, while framing and context certainly affect the magnitude of this misperception, the tendency to overestimate racial wealth equality is extremely robust. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This research adopts a consumer focus in examining the impact of perceived legitimacy of sharing economy platforms on attitude and behavioural intention in the accommodation sector. By investigating tourist adoption of sharing economy platforms from a legitimacy perspective, this research differs from past studies which focused on characteristics of new services to predict adoption. Results show that (1) tourists evaluate legitimacy through comparisons with traditional offers in the accommodation sector rather than with other sharing economy offers, (2) lack of legitimacy has a negative effect on guest behavioural intentions and (3) this effect is moderated by relativism. Even though sharing economy platforms’ commercial success may imply that they are enjoying a high level of legitimacy in the eyes of tourists, our results suggest that tourists act as societal actors and that the legitimacy issues raised by the sharing economy are relevant to them and inform their decisions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Hate crime victimization is harmful for victims and those who share the victim’s identity. It may also be harmful for the broader community. Yet, few studies focus on the ripple effects of hate. This paper examines how secondary exposure to hate crime in the neighborhood, through witnessing or hearing about hate crime, influences individual perceptions of ethnic minorities, which in turn can harm social relations. Findings reveal that those who witness hate crime express greater anger towards ethnic minorities. Those who rely on second-hand information about hate crime in the community are more likely to anticipate rejection on the basis of their ethnicity, hold negative attitudes towards ethnic migrants and intend to take actions to exclude new migrants from their communities when compared to those who do not have such information. These findings have implications for community cohesion in multi-ethnic neighborhoods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Physical Education (PE) teachers are subject to a great deal of social stereotyping. The goal of the study is to analyze the main reasons and motivations of three future PE teachers (two females and one male) with motor disabilities to undertake the profession in the future. Their families and the teachers who have taught them also participate. The disabilities are an arm amputation, severe hip dysmetry and Tourette’s syndrome. These future teachers, under a reflective perspective, expose the reasons and motivations why they want to be PE teachers, specifying diversity of experiences in the past and how they would like to teach the subject in the future. The introduction discusses whether disability fits into the ideal body type of PE, delving into the theories of social identity [Tajfel & Turner, 1979. An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin & S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33–47). Brooks- Cole] and social desirability (Paulhus, 2002). A qualitative approach is used in which three categories (established prior to obtaining the results) of analysis are established: (a) Motivations for being a PE teacher; (b) Limitations and obstacles exercised by society; and (c) Professional identity and conception of PE. Interviews with participants and their families, narrative journals and discussion groups are the data collection instruments used. The results show how, despite the fact that the motivation of future teachers is high (want to be physical education teachers above any other profession), the social constraints they face in order to achieve their dream are diverse. These obstacles are manifested in derogatory comments and lack of infrastructure and adapted material to be able to practice. Families and teachers agree that there is still a long way to go to achieve inclusion, especially in the area of PE. This inclusion refers to the acceptance into the subject of all students, regardless of their physical and psychological characteristics. It is essential to continue researching about disability and PE, since it allows breaking down a variety of existing barriers about the beliefs that people with disabilities have about the limitations of teaching the subject. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We aimed to validate a long and a short version of the popular SDO6 scale for children, by testing their reliability and factorial structure, as well as divergent and criterion validity. Italian fourth- and fifth-graders (N = 271; 49.45% female) were administered the Child SDO6 scale, composed of 16 items, along with a series of personality and intergroup relations measures (using foreigners as the minority group). Paralleling results obtained with adults, findings concerning the short version provided evidence for a two-factorial structure, consisting of an SDO-Dominance and an SDO-Anti-egalitarianism dimension. Both for the long and the short version, greater levels of SDO-Dominance and SDO-Anti-egalitarianism were associated with more neuroticism, attitudinal and stereotypic bias, and with less agreeableness, openness to experience, dispositional and intergroup empathy. In conclusions, the two SDO dimensions as assessed by the short Child SDO6 Scale may be relevant variables to consider when testing intergroup relations processes among children. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - I offer a new measure of perceived proprietary right (PPR) to resources as an operationalization of one critical aspect of Harold Blumer’s group threat theory. Black (n = 82), Asian (n = 72), and White (n = 176) participants completed PPR items in the context of a residential resource allocation task designed to evoke competitive threat. A four-factor model of PPR was established through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. For Black participants, competitive threat was directly related to anti-Asian prejudice. For Asian participants, competitive threat was related to anti-Black prejudice indirectly, through belief in merit as a source of PPR. Moderated parallel mediation models also uncovered PPR beliefs–on the basis of past oppression and outsider status–as possible sources of allyship between Black and Asian community members. Findings are discussed in relation to Black and Asian relations specifically and the contribution of PPR to intergroup relations more generally. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Public opinion has moved towards a more restrictive approach to immigration since 2008, particularly in countries more strongly affected by economic recession. This is generally assumed to be a consequence of economic threat due to greater competition for scarce material resources, such as employment, leading to anti-immigration sentiment. However, not all individuals are affected equally by job losses, nor by the presence of migrants. Using data from the European Social Survey (2008–2016), in conjunction with the Labour Force Survey (2007–2016), this paper examines if individuals within occupations and sectors which face economic decline as measured by job losses, and which have a greater representation of migrants, are more likely to express anti-immigration sentiment. In line with the threat hypothesis the study finds that positive job growth is associated with pro-immigration sentiment while a greater share of migrants within occupations and sectors is linked to greater opposition towards immigration. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the United States becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, interactions between Black people and other minority groups have become increasingly common. The present research examined how a perpetrator’s group membership affects judgments of employment discrimination against a Black victim. Four experiments (combined N = 1,016) tested predictions derived from the prototype model of discrimination. Participants reviewed a case file where a Black, Latino, Asian, or White manager rejected a Black job applicant. Attributions to discrimination were much stronger for a Latino, Asian, or White manager compared with a Black manager. Attributions to discrimination were slightly stronger for a White manager compared with an Asian or Latino manager; however, effect sizes for these differences were small. Attributions to discrimination were similar for the Asian and Latino managers. Whether the perpetrator had outgroup standing relative to the victim was the strongest factor influencing attributions to discrimination for a Black victim of employment discrimination. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - As social democratic parties reposition themselves on immigration and integration issues to appeal to anti-immigrant voters, ethnic minority voters may switch to parties that are perceived to better protect their group interests. The Flemish social democrats in Antwerp adopted several policies that were perceived as discriminatory by ethnic minorities in response to the electoral growth of the radical right party, while the francophone social democrats in Liege faced no such threat. Evidence from the Belgian Ethnic Minority Election Study 2014 confirms that ethnic minority voters who perceive their group to be more discriminated in everyday life more likely turn to the radical left in Antwerp but not in Liège, supporting the claim that social democrats cannot adopt assimilationist integration policies unpunished. Besides, findings suggest that ethnic minorities distinguish between different group interests in evaluating parties, contributing to the study of the role of group interests in ethnic minority voting. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In our current diverse society, young people need a wide scope of social citizenship competences to coexist with and understand the otherness of others. Schools are one of the social practices in which students develop these social citizenship competences. This study aims to identify how socio-ethnic diversity in the classroom is related to the social citizenship competences of sixth grade primary school students. To measure students’ social citizenship competences, a video-based situational judgement test (skills) and the Citizenship Competences Questionnaire (knowledge, attitudes and reflection) were administered to 791 students in 54 classes in Flanders (the northern part of Belgium). Socio-ethnic classroom diversity variables were measured by means of a student and parent background questionnaire. A regression analysis with a two-level design at student and classroom level was conducted for each of the social citizenship scales. The results indicate that differences in students’ social citizenship competences are mainly explained by student-level variables. Variables measuring socio-ethnic diversity in the classroom showed that students in more social and ethnic diverse classrooms had more positive attitudes towards dealing with differences, whereas no significant relation with other social citizenship scales was found. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article asks how policy responses to migration in Italy have been shaped both by issue salience and by changing configurations on the centre right of Italian party politics both prior to and following the 2015 ‘migration crisis’. We show that, first, the increased politicisation of ‘irregular’ arrivals into Italy after 2015 changed migration from a relatively ‘quiet’ policy issue to one of ‘loud’ politics meaning that it was highly salient to the public. This salience significantly advantaged the Lega, who by this point had already transformed into an archetypal, European populist radical right party, but could now campaign successfully nationally and dominate the nominal ‘centre-right’ coalition. Second, the imposition when in government between June 2018 and September 2019 by the Lega of policies for migrants and asylum-seekers that focussed solely on prevention and removal and ended what remained of prior policy drift. We show that both trends conform to theoretical expectations regarding the relative power of interest groups and public opinion over public policy that are contingent on public issue salience, which we show to be the most plausible determinant of variation in migration policy, rather than public attitudes or party positions, during the period. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Using data from 28 European countries, this study examines factors influencing public attitude towards the use of AI/Robot. Its multilevel SEM analysis finds that several factors at the individual level including Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy predict public Acceptance of AI/Robot. Although country-level factors such as economic development, government effectiveness and innovation do not directly influence public acceptance of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of general job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that these nationally macro variables influence people’s perceptions of AI and robotics technologies and their confidence in their digital skills. This research enriches the application of the Technology Acceptance Model by using predictive variables at two levels: individual and country. Furthermore, at the individual level, this study uses two variables (e.g. Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy) that are unconventional to TAM, thus contributing to this theoretical model. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article analyses the CDU/CSU’s immigration policies and discourses during the Chancellorship of Angela Merkel. In doing so, it makes four observations. First, the article highlights that the CDU/CSU became proactive when it came to passing new and far-reaching immigration and integration legislation. Second, it is argued that these policies have sent conflicting messages, torn between the opening and closing of Germany’s borders, and between welcoming diversity and demanding cultural assimilation. Third, this article identifies and explains six ways in which the parties have framed immigration in their common election manifestos from 2005 to 2017: as a cultural, economic, security, humanitarian, European, and gendered issue. Fourth, this study analyses the intra-party divisions that came to a head during the migration crisis: the place of Islam in Germany and the creation of a cap on the number of refugees that Germany would take in. Here, it is highlighted that in contrast to Merkel, the CSU, but also parts of the CDU, have called for more restrictive immigration policies and cultural assimilation. These findings are explained with reference to the political context: the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany and the 2018 Bavarian regional elections. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Criminalization of social groups can create new norms for intergroup relations. An example for this is the 2018 amendment to the Hungarian Fundamental Law, which openly criminalizes homeless people. In our research, we investigated whether criminalization of homelessness can become a source of justifying violence against homeless people in the Hungarian context. We assumed that right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation would positively predict support for violence against the homeless, and the acceptance of a criminalizing law can serve as a justification for this. Our hypotheses were tested using a convenience (N = 196) and a representative sample of the population of Budapest (N = 674). We found that both RWA and SDO predicted support for violence, and this connection was mediated by the new law. We also found that justification was influenced by educational level, as the association between SDO and violence increased with higher levels of education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Do multicultural policies affect natives’ attitudes toward immigrants? I investigate whether cross-country differences and within-country changes in multicultural policies are associated with natives’ negative attitudes toward immigrants and to whom the effects are noticeable. The results of multilevel longitudinal analysis indicate that neither cross-country differences nor within-country changes in multicultural policies are directly relevant to natives’ negative attitudes toward immigrants. However, cross-country differences in multicultural policies are negatively associated with the gap in negative attitudes between natives on the political right and left, while within-country changes in multicultural policies are positively associated with negative attitudes among socioeconomically vulnerable people. © 2021 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - Race consistently patterns anti-immigrant bias. However, it is less clear if all racial groups define “being American” in the same way. This work explores the ways ascribed characteristics that define being “American,” termed Ascripted Americanness, potentially contributes to racial variation in attitudes toward immigrants. Using the 2004 & 2014 General Social Survey (n = 1,774), results show that emphasizing any facet of Ascripted Americanness, particularly US ancestry, correlates to anti-immigrant hostility. Furthermore, the connection between Ascripted Americanness and hostility tends to be more pronounced for white adults compared to black or Latinx adults. Ultimately, these findings reveal that hostility toward immigrants is shaped by the racialization of symbolic boundaries around “being American.”. © 2022 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - This article explores the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Using a narrative inquiry methodology, 25 young people between 18 and 29 years participated in in-depth interviews. Their narratives highlighted growing perceptions of difference and how the negative actions and attitudes of a few people in their past continued to shadow their current lives. Influenced by perceived negative attitudes of others to disability and their own internalisation of these, the young people conceptualise a binary of normalcy and difference, finding themselves liminally positioned, somewhere in between, and mostly seeking to avoid a disability association. In new social situations, the young people reported engaging in disability identity management work, while often resisting having disability as part of their identity. These can be conceptualised as acts of resilience and of resistance in the face of oppressive social forces. There is a powerful counter narrative in a sub group of the participants who were actively engaged with peers with experience of disability. For these young people, the inclusion of disability within social identities became possible. The findings of this study have implications for our understandings of managing identities in young lives, particularly for those in marginal positions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The sociological, group-based factors of public opinion formation are often omitted from models of public opinion that rely on survey methodology. This study employs social identity theory and focus group interview technique to demonstrate the value-added from an alternative approach to the issue of opinion formation in authoritarian regimes. The empirical focus is on public opinion in post-Crimea Russia. The focus group interviews conducted in 2016 in two Russian cities reveal the effects of national identity salience and the implications of “depersonalized” political opinion formation in post-Crimea Russia. The study speaks to the increasing repertoire of legitimation mechanisms that modern, “informational” autocrats can rely on in the context of controlled media and public sphere. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Donald Trump frequently attacks foreign countries such as Germany (e.g., via Twitter). Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump’s utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N = 428) revealed that Trump’s anti-German utterances increased EU’s popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU’s popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States. Implications for journalistic news coverage are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The recent surge in protectionist sentiment in countries around the world has rekindled the long-standing debate over the determinants of citizens’ trade policy preferences. We examine the influence of two understudied but increasingly relevant factors–misinformation and economic threat–on support for international trade in the United States. We first show that more than 6–in–10 Americans endorse a salient misperception about Chinese currency manipulation despite extensive evidence to the contrary. Then, based on a preregistered survey experiment, we show that misinformation can be corrected, regardless of whether the threatening frame is present or not. In contrast to these results on factual beliefs, however, we find that trade policy preferences are considerably stable: neither anti-trade misinformation nor an economically threatening frame significantly reduces support for international trade. These findings suggest that political elites’ strategy of ‘playing the China card’ by using misleading and threatening rhetoric is not so effective in mobilizing opposition to trade. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Research on intergroup bias usually focuses on a single dimension of social categorization. In real life, however, people are aware of others’ multiple group memberships and use this information to form attitudesabout them. The present research tests the predictive power of identification, perceived conflict, and perceivedsymbolic threat in explaining the strength of intergroup bias on various dimensions of social categorization inmultiple categorization settings. We conduct a factorial survey experiment, manipulating 9 dimensions ofsocial categorization in diverse samples from 4 countries (n = 12,810 observations, 1,281 participantsrepresenting 103 social groups). The dimensions studied are age, gender, ethnicity, religion, place of residence,education, occupation, income, and 1 country-specific dimension. This approach allows exploring thegeneralizability of established determinants of bias across dimensions of categorization, contexts, and targetgroups. Identification and symbolic threat showed good generalizability across countries and categorizationdimensions, but their effects varied as a function of participant and target groups’ status. Identificationpredicted stronger bias mainly when the participant belonged to a higher status and the target belonged to alower status group. Symbolic threat predicted stronger bias mainly when the target was a minority groupmember. Conflict predicted bias only in few cases, and not only the strength but also the direction of the effectsvaried across countries, dimensions, and target and participant groups. These findings help to clarify the limitsof generalizability of established determinants of intergroup bias and highlight the need for new explanationsof social– cognitive processes among minority group members © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - This article extends theories of how, in the mid-twentieth century, ‘merit-based’ immigration policies, which select immigrants based on individual human capital and social ties, replaced explicitly racist immigration policies that selected on national and racial group origins. It does so in reference to the historical Canadian case, where existing scholarship emphasises the role of macro and meso-level economic, cultural, and political factors in driving immigration policy change. Using a qualitative content analysis of unique archival data on admissions and deportation appeals, the article identifies high-level bureaucrats’ implementation practices as a micro-level mechanism of postwar immigration policy change. This mechanism allowed for low-risk policy experimentation and subsequently paved the way for a more systemic policy shift. The analysis also shows that individual-level assessments of traits like ‘merit’ were not designed to be ‘race free’ but emerged as a way of managing race, at the intersection of class and status. This gave the formal merit-based policy that later emerged a decidedly middle-class inflection. While focused on the historical Canadian case, the findings presented are relevant to broader debates about the role of immigration bureaucrats in policymaking and how race shapes nation-building under merit-based immigration policies. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - There is wide research investigating negative attitudes and behaviors toward gays and lesbians within Western societies. However, only a small amount of studies have addressed attitudes toward transgender individuals, particularly in non-Western societies with younger populations. This study, therefore, aimed to examine the predictors of transphobic attitudes in north Cyprus using young adults. Participants were 148 (96 women, 51 men) Turkish speaking young adults, aged between 18 and 25 years (M =  20.29, SD =  2.38). Participants completed a questionnaire package containing measures of intergroup contact, ambivalent sexism, social dominance orientation, homophobic feelings and attitudes, and transphobia. As expected, results showed that intergroup contact, hostile sexism, and homophobia predicted transphobic attitudes. Implications to ameliorate discriminatory attitudes toward transgender individuals in non-Western cultures are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Virtually all studies on inter-ethnic attitudes in Western Europe and North America find that higher educated individuals report greater tolerance towards migrants and ethnic minorities. The overwhelming evidence on this link has even led scholars to call for educational expansion as a policy measure to increase social cohesion in today’s ever more diverse societies. But most of this evidence comes from cross-sectional correlations, and it is still unclear whether increasing education actually causes greater levels of tolerance. In this study, we follow a cohort of students aged 15 years over a period of 8 years from the German Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS4EU-DE). We focus on students who change from lower tracks into upper secondary and later tertiary education (the ‘treatment’ group) and compare them to a control group of similar students who stay in the lower track and leave school without entering university. Matching and fixed-effects panel regressions provide no evidence for a causal effect of changing into a higher educational track on subsequent prejudice towards ethnic minorities. We conclude that the descriptive difference between educational groups in their attitudes towards ethnic minorities is evident, but attending higher education per se does not seem to cause this difference. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Political scientists agree that inequality harms the consolidation of democracy, raising fears that the erosion of public support for the political regime could lead to political instability, particularly when the distributive conflict is reinforced by ethnicity. Focussing on Latin America, the region with the world’s largest indigenous population and most unequal income distribution, this paper analyses to what extend socioeconomic inequalities lessen levels of support for the political regime, especially among indigenous people. We found—by applying multilevel regression analyses to Latinobarómetro survey databases for the years 2007–2017—that socioeconomic inequalities do affect citizens’ levels of regime support. However, indigenous people are no less likely to be supportive of the political regime than non-indigenous people, even in those countries that are more unequal according to the Gini coefficient or the poverty rate. Furthermore, indigenous people tend to express levels of regime support that are similar to the rest of society’s inclusive among those of lower socioeconomic status. These findings highlight the importance of moving towards a better understanding of how indigenous people see the political regime and its implications for democratic consolidation. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward life extension among college students (N = 484). Older age and male gender were associated with more positive attitudes toward life extension, while religious commitment was not. Authoritarian aggression/submission and social dominance orientation were associated with more positive attitudes toward life extension. The results suggest older people, men, and individuals higher in authoritarian traits and social dominance orientation may be more likely to use life-extending biomedical technology. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The study presented here is the first empirical investigation of the patterns and predictors of the intergenerational transmission of French in Quebec. An online questionnaire was used to gather data from 274 parents from different mother tongue (L1) groups: L1 French, L1 English, L1 French and English, and L1 Other. The results show that L1 French-and-English-speaking parents and L1 Other parents displayed particularly low rates of French transmission. Three variables were found to be significant predictors of the intergenerational transmission of French: having it as one’s L1, high proficiency, and positive attitudes towards the language on the solidarity dimension. The same three variables were also found to be significant predictors for the intergenerational transmission of English in Quebec, indicating that they may not be merely language-specific. Not significant for either French or English were language used with partner, attitudes on the status dimension, Quebec-based social identity, migration background, and location within Quebec. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the identified predictors are context-specific, and what other variables are at play. The article discusses the implications of this study’s findings for theory as well as for language planning in Quebec, and especially the potential effectiveness of acquisition and prestige planning. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Perceived threat is a central feature of theories of intergroup behaviour, such as the minority threat perspective. Studies have linked perceptions of Latinos as threatening the interests of Whites to Whites’ support for more punitive policies in the U.S., especially in areas experiencing a recent growth in the Latino population. This research, however, is limited in that researchers rarely measure perceptions of Latino threat directly and have yet to expand on the limitations of existing measures. To this end, this study was designed to develop a 20-item Perceived Latino Threat Scale (PLTS) and assess its association with relevant external criteria, including several vehicles for the social control of Latinos. The scale was administered to students attending a Southwestern university during the Republican Party presidential primaries (Study 1: N = 332) and just prior to the 2016 election (Study 2: N = 259). Bifactor analyses indicated that perceptions of Latino threat can be subdivided into four dimensions: economic, political, criminal, and opportunity threat. Higher perceptions of Latino threat, especially economic threat, were associated with support for Donald Trump, being a Republican and politically conservative, and harbouring punitive attitudes toward crime and border control. Implications for theory and research are discussed. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between socio-economic status, age, gender, and literacy level and Haitian Gonâviens' attitudes towards Haitian Creole or Kreyòl and French. Most studies that investigated language attitudes of Creolophones have found that they have negative attitudes towards Kreyòl. Nevertheless, previous studies often included participants who are affiliated with education such as students, teachers, and language policy makers, or those from higher social classes. The current study, however, utilized a language attitudes questionnaire to collect data from 78 adult informants from diverse backgrounds. These participants included 21 highly literate, 51 partially literate and 6 illiterate Haitians. Findings revealed that participants of higher socio-economic status have more positive attitudes towards French than those from lower socio-economic status. Results also showed that there is a tendency for age, gender, and literacy level to affect language attitudes. For instance, positive attitudes towards Kreyòl were found to be more prevalent among older participants than younger respondents. Similarly, male participants had more negative attitudes towards French than female informants. Moreover, respondents of lower literacy levels had more negative attitudes towards French than those who were highly literate. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Many children in immigrant households endure unique stressors shaped by national, state, and local immigration policies and enforcement activity in the United States. Qualitative studies find that during times of heightened immigration enforcement, children as young as 3 years of age show signs of behavioral distress related to national anti-immigrant sentiment and the possibility of losing a parent. Using multiple sources of data from 168 racially and ethnically diverse families of children in pre-Kindergarten, the present study examined variability in perceived levels of immigration enforcement threat by parental immigrant status and ethnicity. This study examined associations between immigration enforcement threat and child mental health, self-regulation, and executive functioning and whether parent immigrant status or child gender moderates these associations. We found substantial variability in perceived immigration threat, with immigrant parents and Latinx parents reporting significantly greater levels of immigration threat compared to nonimmigrant parents and non-Latinx parents. Immigration enforcement threat was associated with greater child separation anxiety and overanxious behaviors, and lower self-regulation among boys and girls and among children of immigrant and U.S.-born parents. In contrast to our hypothesis, immigration enforcement threat was associated with higher self-regulation according to independent assessor ratings. Educators and healthcare providers working with young children from immigrant and Latinx households should be aware of the disproportionate stress experienced by immigrant and Latinx families due to a xenophobic sociopolitical climate marked by heightened immigration enforcement threat and racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric. © 2021 Global Alliance for Behavioral Health and Social Justice

AB  - Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and various health protection measures enforced (third section). Methods: The “health protection attitude score” (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting regression coefficients (RC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures. Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors. Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population. However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content control by providers of social platforms is recommended.

AB  - Over the past 2 decades, Alberta’s bitumen industry has emerged as a major point of contention in Canadian politics, with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) project being a recent controversy that has attracted both domestic and international media attention. This brief research report focuses on news coverage of TMX in a rarely studied form of ethnic media: WeChat newsfeeds (known as “public accounts”) targeting Chinese diasporas across Canadian metropolises. A thematic analysis of TMX-related WeChat articles published between January 2016 and May 2021 reveals an overall negative attitude toward the project’s opponents. This stance is mainly due to WeChat public accounts’ heavy reliance on the Canadian mainstream media’s framing of TMX. As a result, the Canadian mainstream media’s downplay of the climate emergency and decarbonization sets the news agendas of the surveyed WeChat public accounts. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-English alternative media to engage ethnic minority groups in broader public conversations on climate change mitigation. Copyright © 2021 Chen.

AB  - Children’s intergroup attitudes arguably reflect different construals of in and out-groups, whereby the former are viewed as composed of unique individuals and the latter of homogeneous members. In three studies, we investigated the scope of information (individual vs. category) Jewish-Israeli 5 and 8-yearolds prefer to receive about “real” in-group (“Jews”) and out-group members (“Arabs” and “Scots”) (Study 1, N = 64); the scope of information Jewish and Arab Israeli 8-year-olds prefer to receive about minimal in and out-groups (Study 2, N = 64); and how providing such information affects children’s intergroup attitudes (Study 3, N = 96). The main findings were that (a) 8-year-olds requested category information more about out-groups than in-groups, and vice-versa regarding individual information— for both, “real” and minimal groups, and (b) providing individual information about a “conflict” outgroup reduced attitudinal biases. These findings highlight children’s differential construal of in and outgroups and suggest ways for remedying biases toward out-groups. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Objective: Schools are an influential source of information on the meaning of race and culture in society and adolescents’ personal lives. Yet, that influence is understudied in the literature on adolescent ethnic–racial identity (ERI) development. Studies of ethnic–racial socialization tend to focus on the family context; the current study measures adolescents’ perceptions of ethnic–racial socialization from the school context. Methods: The sample includes 819 youth aged 12–18 (M = 15.27, SD = 1.58) from 4 ethnic–racial groups. We used structural equation modeling to examine the relations between ethnic–racial socialization and ERI controlling for race, gender, and age. To examine ethnic–racial group membership as a moderator, a multigroup model was used. Results: The findings show that, across ethnic–racial groups, the perceptions of opportunities to learn about one’s ethnic–racial background and messages about American values are positively associated with youths’ exploration of and commitment to their identities. Furthermore, colorblind socialization messages were associated with lower identity commitment. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of the school context in shaping students’ ethnic–racial socialization and identity. This study investigated how what adolescents learn about race/ethnicity and culture in school is associated with their ERI. The findings indicate that opportunities to learn about one’s culture are related to more identity exploration and greater sense of the importance of group membership. Furthermore, opportunities to learn about other cultures promote positive attitudes toward people of different races/ethnicities. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - The issue of immigration has become central to the politics of nations across the world, impacting many aspects of life over the last decade. Researches investigating educational achievement through a cross-national lens have found that immigrant children tend to exhibit lower academic achievement than their native born peers, and that these differences are exacerbated by both family level variables (e.g., socioeconomic status) as well as the school climate. The goal of the current study was to build on earlier work in this area by investigating the nature and degree to which national attitudes towards immigration have changed over time, and whether any such changes were associated with academic achievement for immigrant and native born students. In particular, the relationship between changing attitudes towards immigration and the achievement gap between native and immigrant students. Results of the study demonstrated that nations with more negative attitudes towards refugees in general, and those for which these attitudes became more negative over time had greater achievement gaps than did those nations with more positive attitudes. In addition, these change trajectories moderated relationships between teacher attitudes towards multiculturalism and academic achievement. Copyright © 2021 Finch, Hernández Finch and Avery.

AB  - This paper investigates language attitudes among Raizales from San Andrés and Providencia islands, Colombia. The paper analyzes stereotypical associations to Creole, Spanish, and English and addresses the question of whether or not the perception of linguistic stimuli is a function of the input-language. The study combined a matched-guise (MG) technique and a qualitative approach using a free association task to disclose emic categories to perceive and judge the languages. The results show that the perception of language is very stereotypical and dependent on whether or not the speaker is perceived as a member of the Raizal ethnic group. The MG results showed that speech is perceived differently as a function of the input-language. Spanish stimuli received the lowest scores as compared to Creole and English, suggesting a negative attitude toward Spanish in San Andrés. The paper provides empirical evidence of the perception of language as a response of ethnicity. © 2021, Equinox Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since it emerged in China at the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 virus has spread to almost every country in the world. In response to the health and economic crisis triggered by the pandemic, political legislators were forced to declare a state of national emergency in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Following a critical discourse approach to metaphor analysis, this study examines the metaphors employed by the British and Spanish Prime Ministers in their declarations of the state of emergency. The results support the view that metaphor is a double-edged sword in times of crisis: It is not only used to help people to face the coronavirus pandemic, to instil courage and hope; it also serves as a strategy of positive self-presentation whereby political actors try hard to avoid criticism and gain the approval of public opinion. © 2021 Prensas Universitarias de Zaragoza.

AB  - The form of political polarization where citizens develop strongly negative attitudes toward out-party members and policies has become increasingly prominent across many democracies. Economic hardship and social inequality, as well as intergroup and racial conflict, have been identified as important contributing factors to this phenomenon known as “affective polarization.” Research shows that partisan animosities are exacerbated when these interests and identities become aligned with existing party cleavages. In this paper, we use a model of cultural evolution to study how these forces combine to generate and maintain affective political polarization. We show that economic events can drive both affective polarization and the sorting of group identities along party lines, which, in turn, can magnify the effects of underlying inequality between those groups. But, on a more optimistic note, we show that sufficiently high levels of wealth redistribution through the provision of public goods can counteract this feedback and limit the rise of polarization. We test some of our key theoretical predictions using survey data on intergroup polarization, sorting of racial groups, and affective polarization in the United States over the past 50 y. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Sweden may in many respects be regarded as one of the most gender-equal countries in the world today. However, when looking at the situation of immigrant women a more unsettling picture emerges. Employment rates illustrate large gaps between native and immigrant women, as well as significant gender gaps between immigrant men and women. When investigating plausible explanations for underrepresentation of immigrant women in the labour market, scholars have mainly focussed on cultural and individual explanatory factors. In contrast, this article casts our analytical gaze towards institutional factors by examining the experiences of refugee women who, despite expressing a positive attitude and strong willingness to establish themselves on the Swedish labour market, had not succeeded in finding secure employment. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with refugee women, the results suggest that the insufficient institutional support during the first years in Sweden, devaluation of competence and challenges with 'starting over' are perceived as central barriers hindering their access to the Swedish labour market. To facilitate higher labour force participation among refugee women in Sweden it is crucial to develop and implement gender-sensitive measures that target different groups of immigrant women and meet their distinct experiences, needs, and interests. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - There is an increasing need to understand the structural drivers of immigrant health inequities, including xenophobic and racist policies at the state level in the United States. Databases aggregate state policies related to immigration and research using single year indices examines state policy and immigrant health. Yet none of these sources use a theoretically informed social determinants of immigrant health approach to consider state environments longitudinally, include both exclusionary and inclusionary policies, and are relevant to immigrants from any region of the world or ethnic group. Using an established social determinants of immigrant health framework, a measure of structural xenophobia was created using fourteen policies across five domains: access to public health benefits, higher education, labor and employment, driver's licenses and identification, and immigration enforcement over a ten-year period (2009–2019). To create the Immigration Policy Climate (IPC) index, we used data from state legislatures as well as policy databases from foundations, advocacy organizations, and scholarly articles. We identified and coded 714 US state policies across the 50 US States and the District of Columbia from 2009 to 2019. We calculated annual IPC index scores (range: 12 – 12) as a continuous measure (negative scores: exclusionary; positive scores: inclusionary). Results show that the US has an exclusionary immigration policy climate at the state-level (mean IPC score of −2.5). From 2009 to 2019, two-thirds of state-level immigration policies are exclusionary towards immigrants. About 75% of states experienced a 4-point change or less on the IPC index, and no state changed from largely exclusive to largely inclusive. By aggregating comprehensive, detailed data and a measure of state-level immigration policies over time, the IPC index provides population health researchers with rigorous evidence with which to assess structural xenophobia and an opportunity for longitudinal research on health inequities and immigrant health. © 2021

AB  - Background: Because breastfeeding offers short- and long- term health benefits to mothers and children, breastfeeding promotion and support is a public health priority. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 is not likely to be transmitted via breastmilk. Moreover, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are thought to be contained in breastmilk of mothers with history of COVID-19 infection or vaccination. WHO recommends direct breastfeeding as the preferred infant feeding option during the COVID-19 pandemic, even among women with COVID-19; but conflicting practices have been adopted, which could widen existing inequities in breastfeeding. This study aims to describe how information about breastfeeding was communicated in Mexican media during the pandemic and assess Mexican adults’ beliefs regarding breastfeeding among mothers infected with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a retrospective content analysis of media coverage on breastfeeding in Mexico between March 1 and September 24, 2020, excluding advertisements. For the content analysis, we performed both a sentiment analysis and an analysis based on strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) for breastfeeding promotion. Additionally, we conducted a descriptive analysis of nationally representative data on adults’ beliefs about breastfeeding from the July 2020 round of the ENCOVID-19 survey in Mexico and stratified the results by gender, age, and socioeconomic status. Results: A total of 1014 publications on breastfeeding were identified on the internet and television and in newspapers and magazines. Most information was published during World Breastfeeding Week, celebrated in August. The sentiment analysis showed that 57.2% of all information was classified as positive. The SWOT analysis indicated that most information focused on current actions, messages, policies, or programs that enable breastfeeding (i.e., strengths) or those not currently in place but that may enable breastfeeding (i.e., opportunities) for breastfeeding promotion. However, ENCOVID-19 survey results showed that 67.3% of adults living in households with children under 3 years of age believe that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed, and 19.8% do not know whether these mothers should breastfeed. These beliefs showed differences both by gender and by socioeconomic status. Conclusions: While the Mexican government endorsed the recommendation on breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, communication was sporadic, inconstant and unequal across types of media. There was a widespread notion that mothers with COVID-19 should not breastfeed and due to differences on beliefs by socioeconomic status, health inequities could be exacerbated by increasing the risk of poorer breastfeeding practices and preventing vulnerable groups from reaping the short and long-term benefits of breastfeeding. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Previous studies have indicated a strong link between lay theories and the development of prejudice. The purpose of this article is to review past studies that have examined the relation between a specific lay theory (mindset) and the development of prejudice, as well as highlight areas for future research that will contribute to our theoretical understanding of mindsets (and their relation to prejudice). Specifically, we highlight the need for future studies to examine mindsets from the target's perspective, to explore how contextual cues may influence the development of mindsets over time, and to observe how mindsets motivate collective action among majority group members. Future studies focused on these areas will deepen the field's theoretical understanding of the impact of mindsets on the development of prejudice. Such knowledge, in turn, can inform the construction of future mindset interventions that foster sustainable and concrete improvements in interracial relations and ultimately promote racial equity. © 2021 S.

AB  - Introduction In December 2020, the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved in the United States (U. S.) and recommended for distribution to front-line personnel, including nurses. Nursing students are being prepared to fill critical gaps in the health care workforce and have played important supportive roles during the current pandemic. Research has focused on vaccine intentions of current health care providers and less is known about students' intentions to vaccinate for COVID-19. Methods A national sample of undergraduate nursing students were recruited across five nursing schools in five U.S. regions in December 2020. The survey measured perceived risk/threat of COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, perceived safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, sources for vaccine information and level of intention to become vaccinated [primary, secondary (i.e., delayed), or no intention to vaccinate]. Results The final sample consisted of 772 students. The majority (83.6%) had intentions to be vaccinated, however of those 31.1% indicated secondary intention, a delay in intention or increased hesitancy). The strongest predictors of primary intention were positive attitudes (OR = 6.86; CI = 4.39-10.72), having lower safety concerns (OR = 0.26; CI = 0.18-0.36), and consulting social media as a source of information (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.23-1.97). Asian (OR = 0.47; CI = 0.23-0.97) and Black (OR 0.26; CI = 0.08-0.80) students were more likely to indicate secondary intention as compared to primary intention. Students in the Midwest were most likely to indicate no intention as compared to secondary intention (OR = 4.6; CI = 1.32-16.11). Conclusions As the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved/recommended in the U.S. nursing students had overall high intentions to vaccinate. Findings can guide development of educational interventions that reduce concerns of vaccine safety that are delivered in a way that is supportive and affirming to minoritized populations while being respectful of geo-political differences. © 2021 Fontenot et al.

AB  - Vaccine rejection is a problem severely impacting the global society, especially considering the COVID-19 outbreak. The need to understand the psychological mechanisms underlying the active involvement of the pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine movements is therefore very important both from a theoretical and practical perspective. This paper investigates the group identities of people with positive and negative attitudes towards vaccination, and their attitudes toward general science. A targeted sample study of 192 pro-vaccine and 156 antivaccine group members showed that the group identity of pro-vaccine individuals is higher than of anti-vaccine individuals. and that both pro-vaccine and anti-vaccine individuals had a positive attitude toward science. Results are discussed in context of the heterogeneity of motivations causing vaccine rejection and the relation between active involvement in online discussion and group identity. © 2021 Maciuszek et al.

AB  - The overwhelming goal of large-scale cross-country research is to evaluate consumers’ perception of a sharing economy. The research was limited by the number of respondents, as well as by the countries represented in the survey. Latvia, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus were mostly represented, and only these responses (757) were analyzed. The study used multilevel modelling of sharing economy elements (dependent variable) in relation to personal characteristics (age, gender, income, industry) nested by the self-assessed level of eco-friendliness (a key predictor for the attitude towards sharing economy). Findings: The key personal characteristics, which influence a person’s intention to be involved in the sharing economy practices, are level of income, education, and also self-perceived ecological friendliness. The sharing economy is not only a topic for investigation among academicians, but also an issue on the agenda of the European Commission, because it is considered as a driver for growth and job creation in the European Union. Despite an increasing interest and many studies, there is a limited number of studies focused on difference in perception of sharing economy depending on personal characteristics of respondents. This indicates the necessity of conducting such surveys, involving participants from different European countries. The given paper could be used as a methodological framework for other European researchers who are interested in the exploration of the topic regarding perception of the sharing economy. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Agritourism as a special type of tourist migration is a very important link in the diversification of rural areas, connecting the geography, culture, tradition, and gastronomy of the local population, and placing products and services through the hospitality and tourism market. Thanks to this form of tourism, underdeveloped places are gaining in importance and attracting the attention of visitors who are oriented towards natural things, which in turn contributes to a better economic situation of the locality and the population. This paper aims to examine the attitudes of farm owners in the Republic of Serbia toward the impact of agritourism on the economy, living environment, social life, and culture. The data were collected by surveying the owners of agricultural holdings in the territory of the Republic of Serbia and statistically processed using factor analysis, descriptive statistics, and linear regression. Based on the obtained results, it has been established that the owners of agricultural farms are interested in the development of agritourism, and that their positive perception of the impact that agritourism has on the living environment and economy greatly contributes to that. To a lesser extent, a positive attitude was noted toward the importance of agrotourism for the local community and locals, where the positive aspects of agritourism were the education of visitors on agriculture, promotion of the local culture, agricultural and gastronomic products, and sustainable development and investment in infrastructure. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - A so-called COVID-19 passport or Immunity passport (IP) has been proposed to facilitate the mobility of individuals while the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists. A COVID-19 passport can play a key role in the control of the pandemic, specifically in areas with a high density of population, and the help of smart city technology could be very useful to successfully implement IPs. This research studies the impact of ethical judgments on user attitudes toward using vaccine passports based on a Multidimensional Ethics Scale (MES) that contains five ethical constructs: moral equity, relativism, egoism, utilitarianism, and contractualism. Regression analysis shows that MES satisfactorily explains attitude (R2 = 87.82%, p &lt; 0.001) and that a positive evaluation in moral equity, egoism and utilitarianism is significant (p &lt; 0.001). The objective of the passport (variable leisure) shows a significant negative moderating effect on moral equity (coefficient = −0.147, p = 0.0302) and a positive one on relativism (coefficient = 0.158, p = 0.0287). Adjustment by means of fsQCA shows that five ethical constructs satisfactorily explain both favorable and unfavorable attitudes toward IPs. Solutions explaining acceptance attain an overall consistency (cons) = 0.871 and coverage (cov) = 0.980. In the case of resistance, we found that cons = 0.979 and cov = 0.775. However, that influence is asymmetrical. To have a positive attitude toward the passport, it is a sufficient condition to attain a positive evaluation on a single ethical factor. On the other hand, when explaining resistance, and with the exception of the recipe ~utilitarianism (cons = 0.911 and cov = 0.859), explanatory prime implications require the interaction of at least two variables. Likewise, the context in which the passport is required is significant to explain rejection. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Mobility restriction is the most effective measure to control the spread of infectious disease at its early stage, especially if a cure and vaccine are not available. When control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) required strong precautionary measures, lockdowns were necessarily implemented in countries around the globe. Public health risk communication about the justification and scope of a lockdown was challenging as it involved a conflict between solidarity and individual liberty and a trade-off between various values across groups with different socioeconomic statuses. In the study, we examined public responses to the government-announced “circuit breaker” (a local term for lockdown) at four-time points in Singapore: (1) entry, (2) extension, (3) exit of lockdown ‘phase 1’ and (4) entry of lockdown ‘phase 2’. Methods: We randomly collected 100 comments from the relevant articles on new organisations’ Facebook and Instagram pages and conducted preliminary coding. Later, additional random 20 comments were collected to check the data saturation. Content analysis was focused on identifying themes that emerged from the responses across the four-time points. Results: At the entry, public support for the lockdown was prevalent; yet most responses were abstract with uncertainty. At six weeks of lockdown, initial public responses with uncertainty turned into salient narratives of their lived experiences and hardship with lockdown and unmasking of societal weaknesses caused by COVID-19. At the entry to phase 2, responses were centred on social-economic impact, disparity, and lockdown burnout with the contested notion of continuing solidarity. A temporal pattern was seen in the rationalisation of the lockdown experience from trust, anxiety, attribution of pandemic and lockdown, blaming of non-compliant behaviours, and confusion. Conclusions: The findings indicated a temporal evolution of public responses from solidarity, attribution of the sustained pandemic, increasing ambiguity towards strong precautionary measures, concerns about economic hardship and mental well-being to worsened social vulnerability, where the government’s restrictive policies were questioned with anxiety and confusion. Public health risk communication in response to COVID-19 should be transparent and address health equity and social justice to enhance individual and collective responsibility in protecting the public from the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The objective of the study was to demonstrate attitudes towards wind energy facilities in the area of the Korsze Commune. The results of the study were processed using structure indices calculated from the respondents’ answers, which were analyzed in terms of social and economic factors. The study revealed that both the NIMBY syndrome and the lack of civic engagement influence attitudes towards renewable energy technologies in rural areas. The NIMBY (“not in my backyard”) term describes negative public attitudes towards proposed development projects. However, some trends towards more pronounced attitudes can be observed, depending on socioeconomic conditions. The research results imply that the measures taken to promote renewable energy technologies should be designed differently depending on the socioeconomic situation of the targeted audience. Young people might be reached via social media appropriate to their age, and through campaigns promoting local investments. For older people, traditional ways of communication can be used, but the information transmitted should include specific benefits for the whole society as well as for individual households. The conducted research revealed that, despite the fact that many authors deny the occurrence of NIMBY syndrome in relation to the wind energy, the NIMBY problem has occurred in the Korsze Commune. The biggest challenge in the survey was the unwillingness of the residents to participate in it, which only confirms the lack of social involvement. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Proponents of hay milk farming claim several benefits on an ecological and economic level, while little about the social aspects has been studied so far. The present study serves as a first exploration of certain aspects of social sustainability from the perspective of hay milk farmers. The results of an online survey of 284 Austrian hay milk farmers are presented. The statistical analyses included Fisher’s exact tests (contingency tables), Kendall’s rank correlations and a two-step cluster analysis. The sampled farms show positive attitudes toward the work in agriculture (e.g., contribution to the cultural landscape) and are mainly satisfied regarding several job aspects (e.g., occupational diversity), but to a great extent dissatisfied with others (e.g., social recognition, time resources). The critical stressors are the agricultural policy, the economic situation, too little time for partnership or family life as well as bureaucracy and work overload. Multiple medium associations between aspects of well-being are revealed. Obvious and meaningful relationships between farm characteristics and aspects of well-being are scarce. The cluster analysis does little to help explain the characteristics of well-being within the patterns of farms. It therefore seems that the perception of the investigated aspects of well-being on hay milk farms is mostly formed individually and is only associated with the farms’ characteristics to a certain degree. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Asians hold a collectivistic culture, and they feel attachment to people who have the same ethnic background. This study explored how roles of ethnic identity influenced fan behaviors of Korean audiences toward Hyun-jin Ryu, the Korean Major League Baseball player. The results showed that ethnic identity influenced player identification, which led to attitudes toward the L.A. Dodgers. Congruence mediated the relationship between ethnic identity and player identification. It is also found that transportation mediated the relationship between player identification and attitudes toward the L.A. Dodgers. These results provide a cultural explanation of fan behaviors of ethnic players. Managerial implications can also be found. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Transgender refugees are at risk of experiencing increased minority stress due to experiences of trauma in their country of origin, and the intersection of multiple marginalized identities in their host country. Adopting a transfeminist and decolonial approach, the present study aimed at exploring transgender refugees’ experiences of life and migration. A semi-structured interview protocol was developed, grounded in the perspectives of minority stress and intersectionality. Participants were five transgender refugees (four women and one non-binary) from different cultural/geographic contexts, professing different religions. Using thematic analysis, the researchers identified three themes: pre-and post-migration minority stress and transphobia; religion as a protective factor for gender affirmation; and individuation and the synthesis of social identities. Participants reported traumatic experiences and the inability to openly live out their gender identity in their country of origin as the main push factors to migration. They also reported feelings of isolation and experiences of victimization during interactions with the Italian asylum services, due to a lack of adequate training, racial prejudice, and transphobia. Participants demonstrated positive individuation, linked to gender affirmation treatments and religious protective factors. The interview protocol may be used by social operators to support the claims of transgender asylum seekers, and to clinically assess transgender people with an immigrant background. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Muslims and immigrants have both been subjected to negative attitudes over the past several decades in Europe. Using data from the European Values Study, this study analyses the changes in these attitudes in the period 1990–2017. We find that negative attitudes have been increasing on average in Europe as a whole, with anti-Muslim attitudes being more prevalent than anti-immigrant attitudes. However, when split into a Western European set and an Eastern European set, from 2008, there is a divergence between the two halves. Our findings reveal that negative attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants have decreased in Western Europe, whereas they have increased significantly in Eastern Europe. Further analyses find that there are large discrepancies between anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes in different countries. These discrepancies are discussed in detail and related to several relevant factors, such as the differences in size of the Muslim and immigrant populations, variations in the refugee influx and other possible factors and developments. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Monitoring trends in community opinion can identify critical opportunities to implement upstream health policies or interventions. Our study examines change and demographic modifiers of change in community perceptions of government intervention for prevention of lifestyle-related chronic disease across two time points in Australia. Methods: Data were drawn from the 2016 (n = 2052) and 2018 (n = 2601) waves of a nationally representative cross-sectional telephone survey, ‘AUSPOPS’. Survey questions gauged perceptions of government intervention for health in general, peoples’/organizations’ role in maintaining health (e.g., parents, government) and support for specific health interventions (e.g., taxing soft drink). Bivariate and multivariate regression models tested for change between the two surveys, adjusted for demographic characteristics. Models with interactions between survey wave and demographic variables tested for differential change. One-tailed variance ratio tests examined whether opinions had become more polarized in 2018 compared with 2016. Results: The large, significant increase observed in the perceived size of the role that government has in maintaining people’s health was uniform across demographic subpopulations. The role for employers and private health insurers was also perceived to be larger in 2018 compared with 2016, but the degree of change varied by gender, age and/or socioeconomic status. Support for some government interventions (e.g., taxing soft drinks) increased among specific demographic subgroups whilst exhibiting no overall change. Opinion was more polarized on general attitudes to government intervention for population health in 2018 compared to 2016, despite little change in central tendency. Conclusions: Opportunities may exist to implement government health-promoting policies (e.g., taxing soft drinks), although advocacy may be needed to address the concerns of less supportive subpopulations. Attitudes on government intervention in general may be becoming more polarized; future research examining the association of such changes with exposure to different information sources could inform communication strategies for future health policy change. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Abstract: Environmental degradation continues to be one of the greatest threats to human well-being, posing a disproportionate burden on communities of color. Environmental action, however, fails to reflect this urgency, leaving social-behavioral research at the frontier of environmental conservation, as well as environmental justice. Broad societal consensus for environmental action is particularly sparse among conservatives. The lack of even small personal sacrifices in favor of the environment could be attributed to the relatively low salience of environmental threats to white Americans and the partisan nature of environmentalism in America. We evaluate if (1) environmental action is causally related to the ideological value framing of an environmental issue; and (2) if the perceived race of impacted communities influences environmental action as a function of racial resentment. With this large-scale, original survey experiment examining the case of air-pollution, we find weak support for the first, but we do not find evidence for the second. We advance our understanding of environmental justice advocacy and environmental inaction in the United States.

AB  - Background: There are many effective treatment options for substance use disorder (SUD), yet most individuals with SUD do not seek formal treatment services. Given the rising popularity of TikTok and need to foster innovative means through which to attract and engage individuals with SUD with treatment, we sought to characterize how TikTok users in SUD recovery are using this platform to bolster their recovery support and/or give hope to others who are struggling with substance use. Methods: Our sample consisted of 82 of the most liked TikTok videos related to attempts to cut down on or abstain from substances and/or strengthen SUD recovery. We employed an iterative process to codebook development resulting in codes for demographics, user-sentiment, video type, and mechanisms of recovery-related behavior change. Videos were independently double-coded and evaluated for inter-rater reliability. Results: Video in this sample were heavily viewed, accounting for over 2 million views per video and 325,000 likes on average. Most common video themes were sharing a journey from active SUD to recovery (40.2%) and sharing/celebrating a recovery milestone (37.8%), followed by recurrence of substance use (12.2%). Commonly exemplified mechanisms of recovery-related behavior change included embracing a strong social identity as a person in recovery (81.7%), social support (45.1%), and participation in rewarding alternative activities (39.0%). Conclusion: TikTok SUD recovery-focused videos can potentially reach millions with portrayed themes similar to established therapeutic mobilizers and mechanisms. More research is needed to better understand whether digital recovery narratives can effectively normalize experiences of addiction and help-seeking behaviors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: While patient and public involvement (PPI) in clinical trials is beneficial and mandated by some funders, formal guidance on how to implement PPI is limited and challenges have been reported. We aimed to investigate how PPI is approached within a UK Clinical Trials Unit (CTU)’s portfolio of randomised controlled trials, perceived barriers to/facilitators of its successful implementation, and perspectives on the CTU’s role in PPI. Methods: A mixed-methods study design, involving (1) an online survey of 26 trial managers (TMs) and (2) Interviews with Trial Management Group members and public contributors from 8 case-study trials. Quantitative survey data were summarised using descriptive statistics and interview transcripts analysed thematically. Two public contributors advised throughout and are co-authors. Results: (1) 21 TMs completed the survey; (2) 19 in-depth interviews were conducted with public contributors (n=8), TMs (n=5), chief investigators (n=3), PPI coordinators (n=2) and a researcher. 15/21 TMs surveyed reported that a public contributor was on the trial team, and 5 used another PPI method. 12/21 TMs reported that public contributors were paid (range £10–50/h). 5 TMs reported that training was provided for public contributors and few staff members had received any formal PPI training. The most commonly reported tasks undertaken by public contributors were the review of participant-facing materials/study documents and advising on recruitment/retention strategies. Public contributors wanted and valued feedback on changes made due to their input, but it was not always provided. Barriers to successful PPI included recruitment challenges, group dynamics, maintaining professional boundaries, negative attitudes to PPI amongst some researchers, a lack of continuity of trial staff, and the academic environment. Successful PPI required early and explicit planning, sharing of power and ownership of the trial with public contributors, building and maintaining relationships, and joint understanding and clarity about expectations/roles. CTUs have an important role to play in supporting recruitment, signposting and coordinating PPI. Conclusions: While highly valuable, PPI in trials is currently variable. PPI representatives are recruited informally, may not be provided with any training and are paid inconsistently across trials. Study findings can help optimise PPI in trials and ensure researchers and public contributors are adequately supported. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - With the rise of prejudice and discrimination against ethnic and immigrant minorities, strategies to reduce prejudice and discrimination, and to counteract the impact of intolerant, antiegalitarian ideologies, are needed. Here we focused on cultural humility, i.e., the ability to have a humble and other-oriented approach to others’ cultural backgrounds, resulting from self-examination and critical thinking about structural privileges and inequalities. In this research we proposed that cultural humility might attenuate the effects of intolerant, anti-egalitarian ideologies such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) on negative intergroup attitudes and perceptions. In a correlational study conducted in Italy, we found that cultural humility moderated the associations between SDO and prejudice toward immigrants, as well as between SDO and perceptions of threat posed by immigrants. Specifically, the associations of SDO with prejudice and threat were lower among respondents with high cultural humility compared to respondents with low cultural humility. Conversely, cultural humility did not moderate the effects of RWA on prejudice and threat. Findings are discussed considering the motivations underlying prejudice of high-SDO and high-RWA individuals, and proposing cultural humility training to foster positive intergroup relations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Public attitude towards onshore wind farm development in Ireland has been extensively investigated. Prior to this study, there was little or no understanding of the perception of the Irish public of offshore wind farms (OSWFs). At this critical juncture in the development of the sector, it is necessary to gauge public opinion regarding offshore wind farms. Data was collected using an online survey (n = 1154) between May and June 2019. Results detail the opinions and attitudes of the Irish public toward the development of renewable energy projects in Irish waters. Demographics showed a 49% male, 51% female split. Education levels and age ranges roughly follow the same distribution levels as seen in the 2016 census of Ireland. Results indicate that attitudes to planned offshore wind farms change significantly with education levels. The evidence suggests that the link between climate change mitigation by energy emissions reduction and offshore wind farms is an important aspect of public perception that supports the development of the sector in Ireland. Most of those questioned believed that Ireland is too reliant on foreign energy and agreed that Ireland is running out of its limited fossil fuel reserves. The majority of people also believed that the government is not doing enough to reduce carbon emissions and should invest in offshore wind farms. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed believed that offshore wind farms will increase Ireland's job creation potential. A clear majority of those who took part in the survey were in favour of offshore wind farms both on a local and national level. Just over half of the participants believed that offshore wind farms are the best solution to our energy situation. Thirty-seven percent of respondents trust offshore wind farm developers and 34% indicate that they were neutral on the subject. Fifteen percent of those who took part in the survey indicated that they mistrust developers. Approximately half of respondents had previous experience of offshore wind farms (the majority of whom had experienced offshore wind farms on holiday). A minority group had experience of offshore wind farms as a result of their daily commute or had an offshore wind farm in the vicinity of their homes. The data confirmed the hypothesis that experience of offshore wind farms has a significant effect on attitudes towards them. Results show that those with experience of offshore wind farms are more positive towards offshore wind farm development in Irish waters, than those with no experience of offshore wind farms. To further investigate the perception of those who are regularly exposed to offshore wind farms, a focus group involving five members of the public with regular exposure to Ireland's only wind farm, Arklow Bank Wind Park, was held. The scope of sentiment expressed towards the offshore turbines ranged from benign to extremely positive. Returning to the results of the national survey; in terms of the effect on wildlife, tourism and aesthetics, respondents found offshore wind farms to be relatively unobtrusive and in general a positive addition to the sea scape. This report provides a resource for the offshore wind industry and policy makers alike. The data would suggest that an opportunity exists to create a public awareness campaign as a next step, to build on the favourable national mood and public understanding of the role of offshore wind in decarbonising the economy. © 2021

AB  - Background: HIV stigma undermines a person’s wellbeing and quality of life and hinders HIV control efforts. This study examined the extent and drivers of HIV stigma in the teaching hospitals in Sana’a City, Yemen. The country has low HIV prevalence (4000 (2000-11,000) per 100,000) and limited HIV control funds, worsened by a long conflict and an economic crisis. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 320 Yemeni health professionals in all the four teaching hospitals in Sana’a City. Data were collected anonymously, using an adapted self-completed Arabic version of the Health Policy Project HIV Stigma tool. The questionnaire covered the respondents’ background, the stigmatising practices, and potential personal and professional drivers of stigma. Results: The majority of the participants were: females (68%), 20–39 years old (85%), nurses (84%), and holding a nursing diploma (69%) or a bachelor’s degree (27%). None of the hospitals had institutional policies against HIV stigma, and 93% of the participants believed the current infection control measures were inadequate. Less than half of the participants provided care for people living with HIV (PLHIV) (45%), had received HIV training (33%), and were confident that their HIV knowledge was adequate (23%). The majority indicated a preference to test patients for HIV prior to surgical procedures (77%) and disclose positive HIV results to others (99%) without prior knowledge or consent. All the participants had exhibited a form of HIV-related stigmatization, such as avoiding physical contact with PLHIV (87%) or wearing gloves throughout the consultation (96.5%). These practices were significantly correlated with the fear of infection, high perceived risk of infection, and poor work environment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: PLHIV face widespread stigmatizing behaviour in the teaching hospitals in Sana’a City, consistent with the higher level of stigma in low HIV prevalence countries and its links to the fear of infection, poor HIV knowledge, and limited funding for HIV control. Stigma reduction interventions are required at institutional and individual levels. In addition, anti-discrimination policies and structural adjustments are needed, in combination with training on HIV and universal precautions, and action to tackle negative attitudes towards PLHIV and key populations. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Do parties respond to ethnopolitical context when nominating and placing ethnic minority candidates in open-list proportional representation (PR) systems? Open-list PR is by nature candidate centered. Candidates need to attract preference votes to succeed. Political leaders, we argue, anticipate candidates' ability to generate support and the extent of anti-minority sentiment in districts when nominating and placing candidates. To test our arguments, we analyze data on 8945 candidates competing across 124 localities in Latvia's 2017 local elections. Few studies have explored open-list systems in countries like Latvia where preference voting routinely alters list order. Other studies stress the role that context plays in ethnic minority representation, but often lack data on crucial indicators. Our results show that parties nominated more minority candidates in localities with more ethnic minority voters and fewer in those with larger noncitizen populations. We did not, however, find that ethnopolitical context affected list placement. © 2021

AB  - Background: The study aimed to explore the factors influencing protective behavior and its association with factors during the post-COVID-19 period in China based on the risk perception emotion model and the protective action decision model (PADM). Methods: A total of 2830 valid questionnaires were collected as data for empirical analysis via network sampling in China. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed to explore the relationships between the latent variables. Results: SEM indicated that social emotion significantly positively affected protective behavior and intention. Protective behavioral intention had significant direct effects on protective behavior, and the direct effects were also the largest. Government trust did not have a significant effect on protective behavior but did have a significant indirect effect. Moreover, it was found that government trust had the greatest direct effect on social emotion. In addition, we found that excessive risk perception level may directly reduce people’s intention and frequency of engaging in protective behavior, which was not conducive to positive, protective behavior. Conclusion: In the post-COVID-19 period, theoretical framework constructed in this study can be used to evaluate people’s protective behavior. The government should strengthen its information-sharing and interaction with the public, enhance people’s trust in the government, create a positive social mood, appropriately regulate people's risk perception, and, finally, maintain a positive attitude and intent of protection. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper aims at exploring the issues related to implementing a formative assessment model namely School-Based Assessment (SBA) at secondary schools in Bangladesh. A qualitative study employing interviews with English teachers of grade 8 and the head teachers and FGDs with students from twelve secondary schools was conducted. Moreover, field notes and document analysis provided valuable data. The findings from the qualitative content analysis showed a dismal condition of implementing SBA in Bangladesh. Some distinct reasons posed challenges to implementing SBA. These are teachers’ insufficient orientation towards SBA, teachers’ negative attitude towards SBA, teachers’ heavy workloads, large class size, large contents of syllabus, no reflection of the marks of SBA in public examinations, lack of honesty and fairness in teachers, lack of validity and reliability of SBA as an assessment tool, poor socio-economic conditions of teachers, and the absence of monitoring and supervision by concerned authorities. This study also provides a comprehensive understanding of how teachers conceptualize and apply strategies of SBA in their classrooms, along with some recommendations and, hence, bears implications for the policy makers, teacher trainers, and other stakeholders involved in the Bangladeshi school education system and elsewhere. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The current study compared the effects of two types of flipped instruction (FI) (low- and mid-tech) with two other class conditions, a blended course and a conventional teaching, on learning outcome of language learners with different levels of impulsivity in an on-campus General English (GE) course. To attain such a goal, four GE classes consisting of 100 freshmen (25 students in each class) were selected and organized into 3 experimental (mid-tech FI, low-tech FI, blended instruction) and 1 control group (conventional teaching). In low-tech flipped class, the students were provided with the vodcasts and podcasts of the instructor’s teaching. For the mid-tech flipped class, the podcasts and vodcasts were integrated into an educational website where all instructional and supplementary materials were available. The blended group accessed the educational website after the instructor’s teaching as the extension of the class activities. The control group received the GE conventional instruction (chalk and talk approach). The participants’ learning outcome was assessed by reading paper of Preliminary English Test and their level of impulsivity was measured by BIS-11. The quantitative data were analysed by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the results revealed a statistically significant difference in reading proficiency of the four groups after the study, in favour of the mid-tech FI. Moreover, while the type of instruction had no effect on reading proficiency of students with different levels of impulsivity across groups, within group comparisons revealed that only mid-tech group members with different levels of impulsivity benefited equally from the instruction. The results of the qualitative data analysis revealed that the majority of students in both groups had positive attitudes towards the experience, although they expressed their needs for some modifications in teacher role, their own role, and the way the instructional materials are prepared and presented. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Although populist leaders often employ an anti-elite discourse which presents the elite as unable or unwilling to represent ordinary citizens, we know very little about who elites actually think should be represented, or how this differs, if at, all from what ordinary citizens want. In this article we find that there is a considerable difference between the groups that voters want to see represented in parliament and those which political elites want to see represented. In particular, we find that political elites tend to hold far more ‘cosmopolitan’ preferences than ordinary voters, and prioritize the representation of greater diversity in parliament based on the groups politicised by the new social movements and identity politics of the 60s and 70s, such as women, ethnic minorities, LGBT and the disabled. By contrast, voters more often hold nativist preferences than political elites and more often prioritize the representation of groups such as the working class, and white local people. Moreover, British voters who hold nativist preferences of political representation are more likely to be politically alienated and more likely to support Brexit. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Does increasing immigration affect natives’ attitudes towards immigrants? A significant volume of research has been conducted in Western contexts to explore this question. However, we know little about whether findings observed in Western societies translate to non-Western contexts. At the same time, there is a paucity of research into whether increasing immigration exerts differential-effects among different groups of individuals. Using Japanese and British longitudinal data, this study firstly compares and contrasts how immigrant-share in an environment affects anti-immigrant sentiment in Japan and Great Britain. Secondly, it explores two potential drivers of heterogeneity in the impact of immigration across individuals: (a) perceived financial situation, and (b) views towards the role government should play in issues of support for the vulnerable. Applying fixed-effects panel data modelling, the results show increasing immigration harms attitudes towards immigrants. Furthermore, these negative effects are stronger for those who perceive their financial situation is worse, and among those who lean further to the left on the role of government. Interestingly, these results are highly similar in Japan and the UK. Thus, these findings support similar mechanisms of the group-threat theory operating among natives in two distinct contexts. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Cities differ widely in how they integrate migrants, even within the same nation state, and this local dimension in integration policies is understudied. One model that a growing number of cities in both Western Europe and North America have been trying out is setting up immigrant councils and other institutional structures to integrate immigrants. Such representation of immigrant interests in local bodies –has accordingly gained more importance. In this paper, we consider two such local consultative bodies focused on immigrant issues in Norway. Drawing on Smith's concept of ‘democratic innovations’ this paper explores the innovative potential in increasing immigrant's political opportunity structure through such institutions and discusses the democratic potential of such boards. The value of consultative bodies like these as a part of cities integration policy is disputed. Much of this contention has to do with their institutional design, as some may end up being ‘institutional ghettos’, while others become catalysts for enhanced participation. We therefore explore how the local context influences the design and performance of such bodies. © 2021

AB  - Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, digital tracking technologies were recognised as one of the key tools in preventing the spread of the virus and maintaining health security. However, they also raised numerous controversies because of their potential to endanger civil rights and privacy. Most studies on the acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies did not include important social factors and did not examine the directionality between variables. We aimed to fill this gap in the present study. Methods: We conducted a four-wave, representative longitudinal panel survey among Polish citizens on the relationship between acceptance of anti-COVID-19 tracking technologies and prosociality, national identification, and endorsement of individual liberty. Analyses were performed using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Results: We observed bidirectional cross-lagged relationships between prosociality and acceptance of anti-COVID 19 tracking technologies, with a stronger path from prosociality to acceptance than the other way around. Endorsement of individual liberty predicted negative attitudes towards technologies and this relation was strengthened by perceived threat of future technological surveillance. We did not find a significant relationship between acceptance of technologies and national identification at the within-subject level. Conclusions: This is the first study to analyse dynamic within-person relationships between communal and individual aspects and acceptance of anti-COVID-19 surveillance technologies. We conclude that prosocial attitude may lead to social acceptance of technology that, while helpful to fight with a pandemic, might also infringe on personal rights. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Research on stereotyping has mainly focused on single social categories such as ethnicity or gender. Extending prior work, here we analyse the effects of the intersection of ethnicity and gender on stereotyping considering the descriptive and prescriptive components of positive and negative stereotype dimensions of morality, sociability and competence. We also examine these interaction effects on the stereotypes–emotions–facilitation behavioural tendencies link. Following a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, Spanish participants evaluated Moroccan immigrant (vs. Spaniard) women (vs. men). We found interaction effects only on descriptive moral character: Moroccan men are perceived as less moral than Spanish men, and less moral and more immoral than Moroccan women. Moreover, (im)morality has a driving role in predicting less facilitation tendencies towards Moroccan men (vs. Moroccan women and Spanish men) via positive emotions. Our findings reveal the primacy of (im)morality in social perception and helping intentions towards targets varying on gender and ethnicity. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Evidence so far shows that Waldorf students are characterized by average science achievement but at the same time high socioeconomic status and high science motivation. Moreover, Waldorf education is characterized by high emphasis on inquiry-based science education (IBSE). The present study investigates if the specific attitude-achievement constellation of Waldorf students in science may be explained by the high level of IBSE. Methods: Propensity score matching was applied to control for Waldorf students’ more advantageous social background using the Austrian PISA 2015 sample (N = 7007 15-year old students). After propensity score matching, 1107 matched controls were included alongside all 149 Waldorf students. Results: The results show that Waldorf students report higher enjoyment in learning science and more interest in broad science topics than matched controls. On the other hand, they demonstrate lower science achievement. Mediation analyses show that, although Waldorf students’ more positive attitudes towards science can be almost entirely attributed to their higher exposure to IBSE, their underperformance in science cannot. Conclusions: These results indicate that attending a school type with a high level of IBSE (Waldorf) may have positive effects on attitudinal outcomes (enjoyment and interest in science) whereas it does not seem to have notable effects on science achievement. This indicates that IBSE could be applied in educational contexts aiming to increase students’ scientific attitudes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In the theoretical literature on tolerance a distinction is proposed between coexistence and respect tolerance. In three studies with four national samples of Dutch majority members, we demonstrate that these two forms of tolerance can be distinguished empirically in relation to different immigrant target groups. The findings of all studies further show that the more principled respect tolerance was negatively associated with prejudice towards immigrants, and positively associated with the acceptance of concrete minority practices, above and beyond prejudice. However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices. The findings indicate that stimulating respect tolerance might be particularly helpful for improving intergroup relations in culturally diverse societies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Currently, Europe is dealing with a large number of asylum seekers. A recent report show that attitudes toward asylum seekers are not that negative in the Netherlands, and yet Dutch citizens living close to asylum seeker centers barely have contact with them. Because contact is vital for a multicultural society, we investigated the facilitators and barriers for Dutch citizens to establish and maintain contact with asylum seekers where they live close together. We conducted semistructured interviews with Dutch people and analyzed them using thematic analysis. We found four themes: Physical possibilities for Contact, Goals for Contact, Social Identities, and Positivity and Openness, and proposed a grounded theory model based on how the themes are related. The findings are discussed in relation to debates on multiculturalism and intergroup tolerance, and can be used to improve the integration policies by local governments, because they present clear conditions and practical information as to how contact can be established and maintained. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The introduction of effective antiretroviral treatment in the late 1990s led to the perception that HIV was a chronic but manageable condition. Nevertheless, stigma remains one of the major hurdles for people living with HIV (PLWH) to accessing healthcare and biomedical preventions. Thus, Fast Track Cities has set a target of zero HIV discrimination by 2030 as part of its strategy to end HIV transmission. Methods: Fifty-three participants from the United Kingdom, including PLWH (n = 21, 40%), health and social care workers (n = 24, 45%), and charity workers and activists (n = 13, 25%), were recruited. Semi-structured interviews investigated stigma and discrimination, focusing on both before and after the widespread use of effective antiretroviral treatment in the late 1990s. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: Before effective antiretroviral treatment narratives were shaped by two main themes: 1) the media’s role in influencing public opinion and contributing to misunderstandings of HIV transmission; and 2) personal experiences of HIV-related stigma, which for PLWH included incidents of physical violence and aggression, as well as fears of their HIV status being publicised. Contemporary narratives on stigma experiences were organised around four themes: 1) discrimination in healthcare settings; 2) stigma amongst men who have sex with men (MSM); 3) stigma towards African and Afro-Caribbean PLWH; and 4) the limits of change in public HIV-related knowledge and attitudes. Contemporary narratives indicated a reduction in enacted stigma, but continued anticipation of discrimination and self-reported shame, particularly in MSM and African and Afro-Caribbean PLWH. Conclusion: The nature of stigma against those with HIV has evolved. The intersection of PLWH and minority groups (e.g. MSM and African and Afro-Caribbean persons) may enhance anticipatory and internalised stigma, with some suggestion that this may contribute to reduced engagement in HIV care and prevention services. Our findings indicate the need for further research in this area, as well as proactive interventions with community groups to enhance knowledge of HIV. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study uses a novel approach to assess the publics’ ability to cope with priority setting and rationing in health care by asking what the public is willing to forego. Items for disinvestment were presented in three separated dimensions: Categories of medical care, quality of service, and items representing social values. A telephone survey was conducted among a representative sample of the Israeli public (N = 609). The response rate was 51%. We identify a few items that a high proportion of the population express readiness to forgo: a drug for smoking cessation, budgets for improving appearance and comfort in medical facilities, and a product for preventing surgical scars. Furthermore, over a quarter of the public was ready to forgo many other items. We found that less than 10% justified their selection in terms of “personally not important to me,” while most respondents evaluated the items they chose to forgo as “less effective or less essential in comparison to others.” The study found that most respondents, when exposed to a range of health system components, were able to identify at least one item that they will be willing to forgo in a time of economic crisis. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We examined the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), psychological entitlement, and narcissistic entitlement in the prediction of White men's negative attitudes and behaviors toward lesbian women and gay men. The present study (a) simultaneously examines four predictors (i.e., psychological and narcissistic entitlement, RWA, and SDO) of attitudes toward lesbian women and gay men (ATLG) and rejecting behaviors, (b) examines psychological and narcissistic entitlement as distinct predictors of ATLG and rejecting behaviors, and (c) tests the potential mediating role of ATLG. A path model was tested using the survey data from 153 White, heterosexual, male college students. Findings indicate that only RWA and narcissistic entitlement were significant predictors of ATLG, which is a strong predictor of rejecting behaviors. Furthermore, ATLG mediates the relationship between RWA and rejecting behaviors (d =.35). In other words, higher RWA is associated with higher ATLG, which is associated with more self-reported rejecting behaviors. Narcissistic entitlement also influences rejecting behaviors through ATLG and both psychological and narcissistic entitlement were found to directly predict gay and lesbian rejecting behaviors. © 2021 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Background: Inequalities in healthcare utilization exist across ethnic groups; however, the contributions of health-related knowledge and psychosocial factors to these inequalities remain unclear. We examined associations of social determinants of health, psychological factors, knowledge, attitudes and health practices, with hospitalizations in internal medicine divisions, among Israeli adults, Jews and Arabs, with non-communicable diseases, in a setting of universal health insurance. Methods: A retrospective study was undertaken among 520 Jews and Arabs aged 40 years or older with non-communicable diseases, members of a large health maintenance organization. Hospitalization (at least once during 2008) in an internal medicine division was determined based on documentation in electronic health records. Participants were randomly selected in strata of sex, population-group and hospitalization status (yes/no). Data were collected from medical records and via face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Main independent variables included comorbidity burden, health behaviors, mental health wellbeing and self-rated health. Scales measuring health knowledge and attitudes/beliefs were constructed using factor analysis. Results: Comorbidity burden (OR 1.41 [95% CI 1.24–1.61]) and self-rated health (not good vs. good) (OR 1.88 [95% CI 1.13–3.12]) were positively associated with hospitalizations in an internal medicine division, while an inverse association was found with better mental health wellbeing (OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.96–0.99, for each 1-point score increase). Among Jewish participants, positive associations were found of the number of offspring, comorbidity burden and perceived difficulty, with hospitalizations. No significant associations were found with hospitalizations of other sociodemographics, health behaviors, knowledge and attitudes/beliefs. Conclusions: Comorbidity burden was the main risk factor of hospitalizations in internal medicine divisions. Psychosocial factors, such as self-rated health, a complex variable affected by social capital, mental wellbeing, the number of offspring, and perceived burden and difficulty, seem also to contribute. These findings suggest the involvement of broad family and social factors, beyond individual level characteristics and medical needs, in hospitalizations in internal medicine divisions. Interventions to reduce hospitalizations should be comprehensive and integrate aspects of mental health wellbeing; they should build on familial characteristics (e.g., number of offspring), factors related to social capital such as self-rated health, and perceived burden and difficulty. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines resettlement patterns in the USA: primary placement patterns where refugees were placed by U.S. dispersion policy, and then internal or secondary migration patterns based on voluntary relocation by resettled refugees. Using data from the U.S. Department of State and from a community-based census, analyses consider labor market conditions and immigration policies (Sanctuary City policy and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program) in cities of refugee resettlement, in addition to geographic region and immigrant population as local-level characteristics salient to secondary migration patterns in the post-September 11 era of resettlement in the USA, using Bhutanese refugees as a case study. Results indicate that U.S. refugee dispersion policy places Bhutanese refugees in cities with poorer labor market conditions, which conflicts with the policy goals of job placement and self-sufficiency. In terms of internal migration, results suggest that Bhutanese refugees follow the paths of immigrants more broadly into “new refugee destinations,” particularly in the midwestern regions, which have fast-growing immigrant populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Until very recently, preconception genetic testing was only conducted in particular communities, ethnic groups or families for which an increased risk of genetic disease was identified. To detect in general population a risk for a couple to have a child affected by a rare, recessive or X-linked, genetic disease, carrier screening is proposed in several countries. We aimed to determine the current public opinion relative to this approach in France, using either a printed or web-based questionnaire. Results: Among the 1568 participants, 91% are favorable to preconception genetic tests and 57% declare to be willing to have the screening if the latter is available. A medical prescription by a family doctor or a gynecologist would be the best way to propose the test for 73%, with a reimbursement from the social security insurance. However, 19% declare not to be willing to use the test because of their ethic or moral convictions, and the fear that the outcome would question the pregnancy. Otherwise, most participants consider that the test is a medical progress despite the risk of an increased medicalization of the pregnancy. Conclusion: This first study in France highlights a global favorable opinion for the preconception genetic carrier testing under a medical prescription and a reimbursement by social security insurance. Our results emphasize as well the complex concerns underpinned by the use of this screening strategy. Therefore, the ethical issues related to these tests include the risk of eugenic drift mentioned by more than half of the participants. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Evaluate the prevention behaviors for osteoporosis (OP) in women (physical activity and calcium intake) and their readiness to perform these behaviors. Method: Women aged ≥30 years in four large cities of Mexico were interviewed. The geographical areas were selected randomly and stratified according to socioeconomic status and age. A questionnaire designed to assess OP-related prevention behaviors, as well as attitudes and stages of change of the transtheoretical model toward these behaviors, was used. Results: Eight hundred and six women were interviewed: 4.2% reported diagnosis of osteopenia, 5% of OP, 2.3% had suffered a fracture, and 11.9% had a family history of OP. A large proportion of participants did not do physical activity (56.2%) and did not have the recommended intake of calcium (61.3%). More than 80% of these participants were in lower stages of change (precontemplation and contemplation) for performing physical activity and 86.4% for calcium intake, which means a lack of readiness to change their behaviors. The absence of readiness to change preventive behaviors was related to negative attitudes toward both behaviors (OR = 1.81, 95% CI [1.04, 3.14] physical activity; OR = 3.09, 95% CI [1.81, 5.29] calcium intake). Both of these behaviors were associated with known risk factors for OP. Conclusion: Very high percentage of women are not ready to perform the behaviors necessary to maintain bone health. This phenomenon was not as a result of clinical risk factors for OP but because of the negative attitudes and beliefs of women related to physical activity and calcium intake. © 2021 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - Although threat perceptions are commonly used to explain attitudes toward immigrants, the psychological factors underlying threat are surprisingly understudied. Drawing from goal pursuit and self-determination theory, we examined the perceived instrumentality of immigrants as an antecedent of locals’ threat and attitudinal perceptions. Through four studies (N = 1,372) with different configurations of local population segments and target immigrant groups, we investigated the impact of immigrants’ instrumentality in terms of hindrances to locals’ autonomy, belonging, and competence needs. Including hindrances to our proposed model of threats and attitudes led to an improvement in the overall fit with the data, allowed for a better specification of the threats-to-attitudes pathways, and elucidated the complexity and downstream consequences (endorsement of pro-immigration policies) of attitudes. The present findings underscore the utility of goal-driven approaches to studying intergroup conflicts, and implications for understanding and improving locals’ attitudes toward immigrants are discussed. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - There is a growing trend to both theoretically and empirically explain public punitiveness from a general social theory of late modernity. Yet, research which has tested the generalizability of this perspective regarding societies other than Western ones remains rare. Relying on a theoretical perspective and empirical findings, this study aimed to explore whether the hypothetical model, which assumes that abstract late modern anxieties (economic anxiety and identity anxiety) affect punitiveness via more tangible fears and negative attitudes toward others in terms of fear of crime, xenophobic attitudes, and social dominance orientation (SDO). The study considered whether this model can be applied to Japanese society, which is experiencing drastic social, economic, and political transformations. Accordingly, data from a nationwide Japanese sample was analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed that all of the hypothesized paths had significant relations, except for a path between xenophobic attitudes and fear of crime, which generally supported the hypothetical model. Moreover, it was shown that all of the variables have a significant total effect on punitiveness. The results were discussed in light of the social circumstances of Japan and recommendations for further international comparative research were made. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Slum development has become a major urban planning and management problem due to the challenges they pose to the larger urban environment. Activities of slum dwellers are known to undermine the social, economic and environmental sustainability efforts of city authorities. This makes the slum environment feature highly in urban regeneration programmes as a way of improving the standards of living of slum dwellers. This study analyses the location of some selected slums in the Kumasi Metropolis and assesses the socio-economic and environmental effects of the activities of the slum dwellers. For the purpose of this study, 260 slum households from Aboabo and Ayigya Zongo, all slums in the Kumasi Metropolis, were randomly selected and interviewed. The results showed that the spatial location of slums within the Kumasi Metropolis is influenced by the availability of undesirable vacant lands. Migrants to the city and other poor households squat on these lands, which later develop into slums. The activities of the slum dwellers were associated with environmental problems such as river pollution and poor environmental sanitation. On the socio-economic front, poor state of health, lower educational outcomes and higher noise emission levels were identified. Based on the findings of the study, there is the need for city authorities to formulate green policies that will help transform these unattractive lands into green spaces to halt the development and expansion of slums. The researchers further recommend that, there is the need for city authorities to deepen environmental awareness campaigns in these slums to guarantee uptake of positive attitude towards the management and utilization of environmental resources in the Metropolis. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Aims: Disasters can affect anyone, but children are the most vulnerable. Schools play an essential role during disasters because children spend most of their time in such institutions, and teachers are among the untapped groups whose potential roles in disaster risk reduction and management (DRRM) are not yet fully realized. In order to provide baseline data that may be useful in developing an intervention geared towards maximizing the potential of teachers in DRRM, disaster preparedness was measured among teachers of Angeles City, Philippines, using a questionnaire designed using the extended parallel process model (EPPM). Subjects and methods: A total of 45 school teachers from Angeles City, Philippines, answered a structured survey questionnaire to assess their current disaster preparedness, and whether their attitude, intentions, behavior, perceived efficacy, perceived threat, and fear constitute a danger control or fear control response. Results: A high percentage of the respondents exhibited danger control responses, although fear control responses were also observed. Perceptions of fear were highest for terrorist attacks and lowest for floods. Conclusion: Overall, through the use of the EPPM-based questionnaire, there is evidence that teachers basically show positive attitudes and intentions towards disaster preparedness, but lack sufficient motivation to exhibit excellent disaster preparedness behavior due to the low perceived threat. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an increase in reported hate crimes, we present the development of a U.K.-focussed instrument designed to evaluate the nature of public beliefs about hate crime, legislation, offenders and victims. In Study 1, 438 participants completed an Anglicized version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Factor analyses revealed three subfactors: Denial (high scores represent a denial of hate crime severity and need for legislation), Compassion (high score reflect compassion toward victims and affected communities) and Sentencing (higher scores reflect more punitive attitudes). In Study 2 (N = 134) we show that scores on Denial are positively associated with those on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), ideologies known to be associated with prejudice. Compassion was negatively associated with these ideologies. Mediation analyses showed that Big Five personality traits Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness predicted Denial and Compassion via RWA, whereas Agreeableness and Openness predicted scores via SDO, consistent with a dual-process motivation model of hate crime beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of hate crime beliefs and the importance of understanding public attitudes which may support undesirable social norms and influence jury decision making in trials of hate related offenses. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Over the past two decades, political scientists have demonstrated that racial animus among white Americans is increasingly associated with evaluations of presidential candidates. Like most work on white racial attitudes, these efforts have focused almost exclusively on the out-group attitudes whites possess toward racial and ethnic minorities. Work in social psychology, however, suggests that intergroup attitudes are usually comprised of both an out-group and an in-group component. Nevertheless, political scientists have tended to overlook or dismiss the possibility that whites’ in-group attitudes are associated with political evaluations. Changing demographic patterns, immigration, the historic election of Obama, and new candidate efforts to appeal to whites as a collective group suggest a need to reconsider the full nature and consequences of the racial attitudes that may influence whites’ electoral preferences. This study, therefore, examines the extent to which both white out-group racial resentment and white in-group racial identity matter in contemporary electoral politics. Comparing the factors associated with vote choice in 2012 and 2016, and candidate evaluations in 2018, this study finds that both attitudes were powerfully associated with candidate evaluations in 2012 and early 2016, although white out-group attitudes overshadowed the electoral impact of in-group racial attitudes by the 2016 general election. The results suggest that there are now two independent racial attitudes tied to whites’ political preferences in the contemporary U.S., and understanding the dynamics of white racial animus and white racial identity across electoral contexts continues to be an important avenue for future work. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Demands on the teacher workforce are changing as one quarter of children in U.S. schools live in immigrant families and about half of students are racial/ethnic minorities. Simultaneously, diminishing teacher support and teacher shortages cause reliance on alternative certification programs (e.g., Teach for America). In response, we studied the links between color-blind racial attitudes and culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy and outcome expectations with immigrant students among 323 teachers completing an alternative program. Results from a moderated mediation model based on social cognitive career theory demonstrated that color-blind racial attitudes were significantly negatively associated with teaching outcome expectations with immigrants. In addition, the link between color-blind attitudes and self-efficacy was positive and significant only for Asian/Asian American teachers, and the link between self-efficacy and outcome expectations was significant for Latinx and Asian/Asian American teachers, and White teachers. We discuss implications for supporting teachers’ career development in schools serving immigrants of color. © Curators of the University of Missouri 2020.

AB  - Teachers play an important role in students’ educational trajectories. As a consequence, their approach to diversity in the classroom might contribute to an unfavorable educational position for ethnic minority students. The current study tested whether teachers in Dutch primary schools differed in their interventions towards ethnic minority students compared to ethnic majority students for the same kind of misbehavior and whether this difference was related to their multicultural attitudes and their abilities to recognize and interpret emotions. Teachers responded to scenarios depicted in vignettes, describing student misbehaviors, by providing the frequency with which they would engage in various intervention strategies. Our results yielded no significant differences in teachers’ intervention strategies to student misbehaviors based on student ethnic background. A notable finding was that teachers’ multicultural attitudes were related to their intervention strategies: an increase in teachers’ positive multicultural attitudes predicted an increase in relatively tolerant (e.g., discussing the misbehavior) as opposed to more dismissive intervention strategies (e.g., sending the student out of class). This finding may suggest that demonstrating positive attitudes towards multiculturalism reflects an awareness of and comfort with cultural diversity, as well as general understanding of individual differences between students and their behaviors. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Early childhood is an important developmental period to focus on the outcomes associated with ethnic-racial identity (ERI) given that children notice racial differences, are processing information about ethnicity and race, and have race-related experiences. The present study tested whether three components of ERI (i.e., positive attitudes, negative attitudes, and centrality) predicted children’s social functioning (i.e., interactive, disruptive, and disconnected play with peers; externalizing behaviors; and observed frustration and cooperation with an adult). Child sex was also tested as a moderator. Method: The present study included 182 5-year-old Mexican-origin children (57% male) of mothers who entered parenthood during adolescence (M = 21.95, SD = 1.00). Results: Children’s positive ethnic-racial attitudes were associated with greater social functioning (i.e., greater interactive play and less externalizing behaviors) among boys and girls, and less frustration among boys. Negative ethnic-racial attitudes predicted maladaptive social functioning (i.e., greater disruptive play) among boys and girls and more disconnected play among girls. Contrary to expectations, ethnic-racial centrality predicted boys’ and girls’ maladaptive social functioning (i.e., greater disruptive and disconnected play). Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of fostering children’s positive ethnic-racial attitudes and helping them discuss and cope with negative ethnic-racial attitudes to promote more adaptive social functioning. © 2021.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has caused phenomenal loss of lives and overburdened the health system in India. Low morale, fatigue, and inadequate knowledge among the healthcare workers (HCWs) are the perceived threats to pandemic control. We aimed to assess the COVID-19 related level of knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) among our HCWs. A cross-sectional, electronically distributed, questionnaire-based study was conducted which identified the demographics of HCWs and the current KAP related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The descriptive statistics were used to present the demographics of the participants and chi-square test was used to assess the differences in KAP among the participants. Of 1,429 total participants, 71.9% belonged to age group 21–40 years. Only 40.2% received any infection control training and 62.7% relied upon single source of information update. However, 82.9% of the participants had adequate knowledge. Being married, urban dwelling, and higher qualification were associated with knowledge adequacy (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the senior HCWs (age 41–50 years) were least likely to have adequate knowledge (74.1%). About 84% had positive attitude toward COVID-19, but 83.8% of the participants feared providing care to the patients with COVID-19. However, 93% of HCWs practiced safety precautions correctly most of the times and training had no influence on practice. In conclusion, more than 80% of HCWs in the study had adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and practiced safely most of the time. However, the pitfalls, such as poor training, knowledge uncertainties, and fear of disease acquisition among the HCWs need to be addressed.

AB  - > Context • Numerous analyses emphasize the historical variability and social construction of the autism category. As a result, many beliefs and stereotypes about autism function unconsciously in social awareness as background knowledge. > Problem • We present the results of a survey concerning the social perception of autism and we draw attention to the possible impact of the specific ways in which people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are perceived, as revealed in the survey, on how this social identity might be created. > Method • A questionnaire consisting of two parts – closed-ended questions and free associations – was used in the survey. 355 participants answered the questions concerning the nature of autism, its causes, sources of information and experiences in contact with people on the spectrum. > Results • The results shows that there exists a cognitively interesting divergence between the level of knowledge declared by the respondents, based on credible sources, which is indicative of a positive attitude toward people with ASD, and the more negative attitude seen in the free associations. > Implications • Despite the level of social reflective knowledge, relations between people with ASD and neurotypical people seem to be lined with feelings such as fear, anxiety or uncertainty. This should draw attention to the need for a deeper and more conscious analysis of societal beliefs about autism. > Constructivist content • The theoretical framework for this survey is social representations theory (SRT), which derives from the constructivist paradigm. By showing the important role of individuals’ background knowledge in the construction of autism social representation, the results of the survey confirm the usefulness of the constructivist approach to the analysis of the autism phenomenon. © 2021 Vrije Universiteit Brussel.

AB  - In Australia and many other countries internationally, aged care services are provided to older people in their own homes or residential care facilities. The majority of these services are funded by the federal government using taxpayer contributions from the general public. However, the monetary value Australians place on aged care services, and the factors that predict this value, have not been examined. We, therefore, sought to determine the general public's willingness to pay (WTP) for aged care services and examine which factors influence this WTP. A cross-sectional contingent valuation survey was administered to a nationally representative cohort of 10,285 Australians between September and October 2020 from the general population aged 18 years and over. Respondents were asked to indicate their WTP values for satisfactory and high-quality aged care services to be provided in the future. A two-part regression model was used to explain what factors explained variation in WTP. In total, 80% (61%) of respondents were willing to pay to access satisfactory (high) quality home care (counterpart figures for residential care were 64% (45%)). On average, respondents were willing to pay between $126 and $158 ($145 and $237) per week to receive satisfactory-quality (high-quality) home care and between $333 and $520 ($308 and $680) per week for satisfactory-quality (high-quality) residential care. Respondents were willing to pay an additional $120 per week on average to access high-quality aged care. Higher WTP values were generally associated with being younger, male, recent experience with aged care through a close family member accessing aged care and ability to pay. These results suggest general public support for payment of individual co-contributions to access aged care services in the future. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Circular Economy (CE) practices and technologies are essential for increasing sustainability performance in manufacturing. Due to the increasing number of environmental regulations and growing public awareness of environmental issues, especially in the EU, CE is increasingly seen as a valuable factor in improving competitiveness. Therefore, there is a need for a fuller understanding of the ways in which CE technologies can be implemented into the manufacturing industries. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the identification of the characteristics of manufacturing companies and their perceptions of the barriers to the adoption of CE technologies. This survey-based study of 241 manufacturing companies (comprising a sub-sample of Slovak and Slovenian companies from the more extensive European Manufacturing Survey) uses a series of statistical tests to examine the implementation of three CE technologies. The results show that there is significant relationship between the adoption of CE technologies in manufacturing companies and their size, location, R&D activities, company age and product batch size. Finally, the research reveals the surprising finding that there is no apparent link between the perception of CE barriers and the plans of companies to implement selected CE technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: This study explored associations between television exposure and public support for restrictive immigration policies in Europe, distinguishing general television exposure from exposure to television news. We explored explanations of generalized social distrust and perceived ethnic threat and, moreover, acknowledged cross-national variation in asylum applicants. Methods: We applied multi-level regression analyses using the European Social Survey (2014–2015), covering 19 countries (n = 29.161). Results: General television exposure and support for restrictive immigration policies related positively, whereas exposure to television news related negatively to these policy preferences. Furthermore, both generalized social distrust and perceived ethnic threat mediated the links between both forms of exposure and these preferences. An increase in the number of asylum applicants strengthened the positive relationship between general television exposure and these policy preferences. Conclusions: This study provides new insights into the role of individual and national factors for support for restrictive immigration policies from a contemporary and cross-national perspective. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction Zimbabwe is the largest producer of tobacco leaf in Africa and the sixth largest globally. Tobacco leaf is a mainstay of the economy, accounting for about 10% of the country's GDP in 2018. Methods We use descriptive and regression analyses from a face-to-face survey of 381 smallholder farmers in three major tobacco-farming areas in Manicaland province to determine the prevalence of tobacco-related debt and some of its covariates. The survey was conducted in June and July 2019. Results 74% of respondents are contract farmers and 26% are independent farmers. 57% of respondents indicated that they were in tobacco-related debt. The likelihood of being in tobacco-related debt is significantly more than average for farmers with the following characteristics (holding other characteristics constant): being a contract farmer, having a larger farm, employing only family labour and not recording expenses (as a proxy for financial sophistication). 91% of contract farmers would prefer to be independent farmers, while 63% of independent farmers would prefer to be contract farmers. Conclusion There is no evidence to suggest that tobacco growing, in its current state, has benefited the tobacco farmers in Manicaland province. Tobacco farmers are largely victims, rather than beneficiaries, of the sector. There is a strong case for government intervention to improve the conditions of tobacco farmers, either through direct intervention in the tobacco-growing sector, or by encouraging and promoting crop substitution. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that majority group members in immigration-receiving societies express differential levels of prejudice and stereotyping toward various immigrant origins. However, there is little research on whether this tendency to differentiate between more vs. less liked immigrant groups is informed by essential psychological motivations and systematically related to individual differences. In this paper, I test whether majority group members’ propensity to express greater differences in affect toward immigrant origins is associated with social dominance orientation. Using survey studies carried out in the Netherlands, the United States, and Britain, I demonstrate that majority group members’ tendency to express differential affect toward immigrant origins holds across national contexts. I also show that individual-level inclination to differentiate between more and less liked immigrant groups is consistently related to social dominance orientation in all three countries. Overall, my findings confirm the group-specific character of anti-immigration attitudes and highlight the role of social-dominance motivations in prejudice toward immigrants. © 2021

AB  - Growth in racial, ethnic, and religious minority populations in western societies has coincided with the growing success of nativist and radical right political parties. A leading target for nativist politicians has been Islamic religious symbols, particularly mosques. But does the presence of mosques within citizens’ milieux influence their political behaviour? To explore this question, we draw on longitudinal survey data from the Netherlands augmented by a web-scraped list of Dutch mosques to investigate the influence of local context – both architectural context in the form of spatial proximity to mosques and local demographic context in the form of visible diversity – on support for the Party for Freedom (PVV), a radical right, nativist political party. Our analyses reveal that while proximity to a mosque increases support for the radical right, proximity to a mosque with a minaret exerts a stronger effect. Also, closer proximity to a mosque with a minaret and greater local diversity amplify the differences in party support between the left and right. These findings allow us to better understand the impact of symbolic cultural threat on voting for nativist parties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This article examines the role of empathy for outgroup helping, collective action and political activism among youth in Northern Ireland, a setting of protracted conflict. Integrating the Empathy-Attitudes-Action model with the Developmental Peacebuilding Model, a two-wave study was conducted to assess youth's behavioural intentions and actual behaviours toward refugees. Across two waves (N = 383, 52 % male, 48 % female; 14−16 years old), empathy at Time 1 predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities at Time 2, which in turn was positively related to four outcomes aiming to foster prosocial change for refugees: helping behaviour and realistic helping at the interpersonal level, collective action intentions at the structural level, and signing a petition aiming for cultural change. That is, outgroup attitudes mediated the link from empathy to three types of prosocial action toward refugees. The findings suggest that youth not only volunteer to help an individual outgroup member, but also support broader structural and cultural change that will benefit those they may never meet. Implications for recognising and supporting the constructive agency of youth toward disadvantaged groups in conflict settings are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - As a result of more racially inclusive immigration policies in the U.S., the African and Caribbean population has increased. Thus far, scholarly inquiry on Black immigrants have focused on their incorporation into the racial hierarchy, their experiences with racism, and their relationships with African Americans. While beneficial, these studies overlook the impact of ethnic discrimination for Black immigrants. Although all individuals of African descent share similar racialized experiences in the U.S., I hypothesize that diverse Black immigrant groups endure unique discriminatory experiences because of their ethnic identities. Thus, through in-depth interviews with 27 Nigerian and 20 Jamaican respondents, this paper explores Black immigrants’ experiences with racial and ethnic discrimination. I found that, regardless of ethnic background, 80% of my Nigerian and Jamaican respondents encountered racism. In contrast, ethnic discrimination varied between my Nigerian and Jamaican respondents. My Nigerian respondents were more likely to report their encounters with ethnic discrimination. These experiences ranged from being accused of internet scamming to being mocked for having an accent. On the other hand, not only were my Jamaican respondents less likely to report ethnic discrimination, but they were also more likely to see their ethnicity as an advantage. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Deficiencies in the skills necessary to diagnose and manage patients with skin of color may contribute to health disparities. The Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance Special Interest Group in Pediatric Skin of Color (PSOCG) convened to generate a curriculum of topics required for basic pediatric skin of color (PSOC) education for medical students and residents in dermatology to improve the quality of education in PSOC. Methods: A survey was distributed to the PSOCG members to assess expert opinion regarding critical topics for inclusion in a basic PSOC syllabus. Video conference and two rounds of survey were used to rank topics for inclusion and to highlight the underlying need for inclusion. Results: Group members composed of academic pediatric dermatologists with teaching responsibilities including skin of color topics for dermatology residents and medical students. Learning objectives were developed for an educational lecture on basic science, and clinical conditions affecting PSOC were grouped by age—infantile, pediatric, and adolescent skin conditions affecting the PSOC population were identified for inclusion with rank score based on specific parameters including greater frequency in skin of color, nuances in skin of color, and need for medical workup. Conclusions: Increased focus on PSOC education is needed to improve quality of care for children of color through enhanced knowledge. Inflammatory, genetic, and particularly primary pigmentary disorders should be the focus of a broad curriculum in pediatric skin of color education for medical trainees. Objectives should include improved diagnosis, treatment, and ability to educate patients and their families regarding the nature of their conditions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Youth of immigrant background are at risk of experiencing victimization due to their ethnic or cultural background. However, limited knowledge is available regarding why youth victimize their immigrant peers, and whether the factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization vary across adolescents of different background. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study aimed to elucidate the common or differential factors associated with engagement in ethnic victimization among immigrant and native youth. The analytical sample included seventh grade students residing in Sweden from 55 classrooms (N = 963, Mage = 13.11, SD = 0.41; 46% girls; 38% youth of immigrant background). The results showed that being morally disengaged and engaging in general victimization are the common denominators of engagement in ethnic victimization for immigrant and Swedish youth. Low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants provide a foundation for ethnic victimization among Swedish youth, but not youth of immigrant background. Classroom ethnic composition was not significantly related to engagement in ethnic victimization in either group. Predictors of engagement in ethnic victimization seem to have similarities and differences among immigrant and Swedish youth. The factors involved require further attention in developing strategies to combat bias-based hostile behaviors in diverse school settings. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Attitudes and social norms are key social psychological concepts that have often been considered as independent determinants of human behavior. However, questions about the interplay between the two are somewhat of a blind spot in social psychology. In the present research, we test the hypothesis that when an important change in norms is involved, behavioral intentions will be shaped by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm, that is the perception of other group members’ attitudes. This proposition is tested and supported across three studies in a context of the conversion to organic farming, a behavior indicative of a significant societal and behavioral change. Farmers who did convert to organic farming were those who perceive other farmers to hold less positive attitudes toward this environmentally-friendly practice compared to their own (Study 1a & 1b, N = 1,023). Among conventional farmers, the intention to convert to organic farming is also predicted by a discrepancy between personal attitudes and the perceived group norm (Study 1b). Finally, among agricultural colleges’ students (Study 2, N = 280), the intention to become an organic farmer was influenced by an interaction between attitudes and perceived group norm and not only by independent effects of these two variables. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for a better understanding of behavioral adaptation in times of social change are discussed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - I examine perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning from 2006 to 2016. White Americans perceived Barack Obama to be significantly more liberal than respondents from other racial groups, and whites scoring higher on measures of racial resentment saw Obama as more liberal than those scoring lower. Perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning shifted leftward early in his presidency but shifted rightward after 2010. This rightward shift notwithstanding, Obama was perceived to be quite liberal from the start of his presidency, and perceptions of his ideological positioning were racialized from the beginning. There is some evidence that citizens' perceptions of Barack Obama's ideological positioning became more racialized between 2012 and 2014. Placements of Hillary Clinton were racialized in 2016, suggesting that the Obama presidency may have lasting effects on the ideological stereotyping of Democratic candidates. I discuss these findings in light of recent research on social sorting, affective polarization, and negative partisanship. Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - Psychological models can only help improve intergroup relations if they accurately characterise the mechanisms underlying social biases. The claim that outgroups suffer dehumanization is near ubiquitous in the social sciences. We challenge the most prominent psychological model of dehumanization - infrahumanization theory - which holds outgroup members are subtly dehumanized by being denied human emotions. We examine the theory across seven intergroup contexts in thirteen pre-registered and highly powered experiments (N = 1690). We find outgroup members are not denied uniquely human emotions relative to ingroup members. Rather, they are ascribed prosocial emotions to a lesser extent but antisocial emotions to a greater extent. Apparent evidence for infrahumanization is better explained by ingroup preference, outgroup derogation and stereotyping. Infrahumanization theory may obscure more than it reveals about intergroup bias. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Social networking sites (SNS) addiction has become a social problem among young adolescents in many areas of the world. The current study examined the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in children and adolescents' SNS addiction, taking into account parents' attitudes and behavior with regard to information communication technology (ICT). Participants were 823 students (ages 9–15; 49.94 % girls) who completed questionnaires in their classrooms. The results showed that: (1) SES was negatively associated with SNS addiction; (2) active parental mediation mediated this association; and (3) parents' ICT attitude moderated this mediating effect; specifically, the association between SES and active parental mediation was weaker for parents with more positive attitudes toward ICT. These findings provide guidance for prevention and intervention related to children and adolescents’ SNS addiction. © 2021

AB  - Ethnicity-targeted hate speech has been widely shown to influence on-the-ground inter-ethnic conflict and violence, especially in such multi-ethnic societies as Russia. Therefore, ethnicity-targeted hate speech detection in user texts is becoming an important task. However, it faces a number of unresolved problems: difficulties of reliable mark-up, informal and indirect ways of expressing negativity in user texts (such as irony, false generalization and attribution of unfavored actions to targeted groups), users’ inclination to express opposite attitudes to different ethnic groups in the same text and, finally, lack of research on languages other than English. In this work we address several of these problems in the task of ethnicity-targeted hate speech detection in Russian-language social media texts. This approach allows us to differentiate between attitudes towards different ethnic groups mentioned in the same text – a task that has never been addressed before. We use a dataset of over 2,6M user messages mentioning ethnic groups to construct a representative sample of 12K instances (ethnic group, text) that are further thoroughly annotated via a special procedure. In contrast to many previous collections that usually comprise extreme cases of toxic speech, representativity of our sample secures a realistic and, therefore, much higher proportion of subtle negativity which additionally complicates its automatic detection. We then experiment with four types of machine learning models, from traditional classifiers such as SVM to deep learning approaches, notably the recently introduced BERT architecture, and interpret their predictions in terms of various linguistic phenomena. In addition to hate speech detection with a text-level two-class approach (hate, no hate), we also justify and implement a unique instance-based three-class approach (positive, neutral, negative attitude, the latter implying hate speech). Our best results are achieved by using fine-tuned and pre-trained RuBERT combined with linguistic features, with F1-hate=0.760, F1-macro=0.833 on the text-level two-class problem comparable to previous studies, and F1-hate=0.813, F1-macro=0.824 on our unique instance-based three-class hate speech detection task. Finally, we perform error analysis, and it reveals that further improvement could be achieved by accounting for complex and creative language issues more accurately, i.e., by detecting irony and unconventional forms of obscene lexicon. © 2021

AB  - Scholars have identified many social-psychological factors correlated with support for Donald Trump; however, attempts at modeling these factors tend to suffer from omitted variable bias on the one hand, or multicollinearity on the other. Both issues obscure inferences. Using two nationally representative surveys, we demonstrate the perils of including or failing to include many of these factors in models of Trump support. We then reconceptualize the social-psychological sources of Trump support as components of a broader “profile” of factors that explains Trump support in 2018 and vote choice in 2016, as well as attitudes about issues connected to Trump. Moreover, this profile—an amalgamation of attitudes about, for example, racial groups, immigrants, and political correctness—rivals partisanship and ideology as predictors of Trump support and is negatively related to support for mainstream Republican candidates. Our analyses suggest that Trump benefited from activating dimensions of public opinion that transcend traditional party cleavages. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We present a model where museum commitment to immigrant integration is conditioned by the possible negative reactions of native visitors and patrons. We then exploit the rich information provided by the 2015 Italian museum census to investigate the factors associated with a higher probability of museums developing promotion programmes targeting an immigrant audience, with a special focus on the size of immigrant communities and the importance of anti-immigrant sentiment in the local context. We proxy the latter with the municipal vote shares of parties with an anti-immigrant agenda in the 2013 national elections. Our evidence shows that the vote share of Lega Nord has a significantly negative and sizable estimated coefficient. Conversely, we find no positive association with the overall share of immigrants—only the size of specific minorities at the local level increases the likelihood that a museum engages immigrants. We control for a number of context variables and specific museum characteristics, some of which (age of establishment, type of collection) show a positive association with museum commitment to immigrant integration. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - This study investigates to what extent ethnic minorities differ from majorities in the degree of confidence in the UN and the scope conditions. Emphasizing the impact of the UN’s involvement, it argues that minorities are predisposed to hold a higher degree of confidence in the UN in countries where ethnic conflict has taken place and this difference is further complicated by the nature of the countries’ political regimes. Utilizing the World Value Surveys for the period 1981–2012, we find robust evidence for our arguments. We also find that minorities probably increase in such trust as ethnic conflict persists longer. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates how game design, which divides players into static teams, can reinforce group polarisation. The authors study this phenomenon from the perspective of social identity in the context of team-based location-based games, with a focus on game slang. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed an exploratory data analysis on an original dataset of n = 242,852 messages from five communication channels to find differences in game slang adoption between three teams in the location-based augmented reality game Pokémon GO. A divisive word “jym” (i.e. a Finnish slang derivative of the word “gym”) was discovered, and players' attitudes towards the word were further probed with a survey (n = 185). Finally, selected participants (n = 25) were interviewed in person to discover any underlying reasons for the observed polarised attitudes. Findings: The players' teams were correlated with attitudes towards “jym”. Face-to-face interviews revealed association of the word to a particular player subgroup and it being used with improper grammar as reasons for the observed negative attitudes. Conflict over (virtual) territorial resources reinforced the polarisation. Practical implications: Game design with static teams and inter-team conflict influences players' social and linguistic identity, which subsequently may result in divisive stratification among otherwise cooperative or friendly player-base. Originality/value: The presented multi-method study connecting linguistic and social stratification is a novel approach to gaining insight on human social interactions, polarisation and group behaviour in the context of location-based games. © 2021, Samuli Laato, Nobufumi Inaba, Mauri Paloheimo and Teemu Daniel Laajala.

AB  - Senior centers must re-envision their programs to appeal to today’s increasingly older and more diverse older adults. Using a purposeful aging framework, this study aims to inform senior center programming by capturing diverse older adults’ perspectives on future goals, perceptions of aging, attitudes about senior centers, and experience with technology. Participants age 70 and older (N = 64) joined one of eight focus groups organized by race/ethnicity and preferred spoken language. Transcripts were coded using a grounded theory approach to identify perspectives in each domain. Across groups, shared perspectives included aspirations to make a difference, maintain health and independence, continue learning, and embrace positive perceptions of aging. However, both positive and negative attitudes about participating in senior centers and the effects of technology were presented. We discuss how to redesign senior center programming to meet members’ proactive approach to aging and future goals, and facilitate more confidence with new technology. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The use of social robots in service scenarios (e.g. in hotels) is expected to increase. Research has indicated that realistic threat and identity threat contribute to prejudice, discrimination, and conflict. Therefore, designing smart robots that can understand user needs and provide prompt service is critical. This study aimed to explore the relationships among perceived threat, negative attitudes toward robots, and usage intention, and to discuss how anthropomorphism moderates the relationship between negative attitudes and usage intention toward robots. We hypothesized that realistic threat and identity threat positively influence negative attitudes toward social robots; such negative attitudes have negative effects on usage intention; and anthropomorphism positively moderates said effect. A between-subjects factorial research design was employed; participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions of robot anthropomorphic appearance. The stimuli were two pictures of service robots—one with a humanoid appearance and one without. After viewing one of the stimuli, participants filled in a questionnaire that assessed the realistic threat, identity threat, negative attitudes, and usage intention. When participants perceived the robot’s appearance to be highly anthropomorphic, their negative attitudes toward it had a stronger negative effect on their usage intention than when they considered the appearance less anthropomorphic. Both identity threat and realistic threat significantly increased negative attitudes toward the robots; thus, the public’s willingness to use these robots would be negatively affected. This study recommends that robotics companies consider how to decrease people’s perceived realistic and identity threats as well as adjust robots’ anthropomorphic appearance to people’s tastes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Does opposition to immigration mostly stem from prejudice or from sociotropic concerns about broad economic and cultural implications on the nation as a whole? Previous work on immigration preferences cannot answer this question because the two explanations are observationally equivalent when focusing on the attitudes of natives. I analyze a unique survey experiment that asks both natives and immigrants of various origins to evaluate different profiles of visa applicants to the Netherlands. The experiment also assigns an “ingroup treatment”—applications by individuals of the same ethnocultural background as the respondent. Using this rich data, I show that sociotropic concerns are the major source of immigration preferences, while ethnic biases play a moderate role. Remarkably, the ingroup treatment has limited effects on admission. However, bias against specific immigrant groups is detected in preferences of immigrant respondents and of those who sympathize with the far-right Freedom Party. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Diversity is an identified priority amongst governing medical bodies. We systematically analyzed public membership diversity data posted by North American radiology societies. Materials and Methods: Two independent study members reviewed North American radiology society websites to collect public data on membership diversity, specifically related to gender, race, and sexual orientation or gender identity, and categorized data using a coding system. Supplemental searches were conducted to confirm findings. Study team members created accounts on each society website to identify whether diversity data was collected during member enrollment. Results: We reviewed a total of 26 society websites, with median 1500 members (range 110–54,600). We categorized five societies as “diversity leaders” based on having diversity statement(s), diversity initiatives, and diversity publication(s). While 62%, 8%, and 0% of societies collected data on gender, race, and sexual orientation or gender identity, respectively, no societies posted membership composition of these groups. Fourty-six percent of societies had membership diversity statement(s) on their webpages. Fifty-four percent had initiative(s) targeted at diversity (23% had multiple). Fifty percent had membership diversity publication(s). Sexual orientation and gender identity minority members were least frequently specified as beneficiaries of diversity statements, initiatives, and publications. Societies with larger memberships were more likely to have membership diversity initiatives (p = 0.01), journal articles on membership diversity (p = 0.005), and be “diversity leaders” (p = 0.02). Conclusion: Public support of membership diversity by many North American radiology societies, especially those with fewer members, is lacking. Identified “diversity leaders” can serve as models for societies aiming to establish their commitment to diversity. © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - The present investigation engages in the debate on populism from a demand/acceptance perspective by providing examinations and explanations within the Chinese context. It clarifies the heterogeneity of China’s populism, separating rights-oriented populism, which shares the element of anti-elitism with the populism found in most European nations, from responsibility-oriented populism, which has ideological roots in China’s specific socio-political contexts. The study finds responsibility-oriented populism to be predominant in China (occupying 76.92% of the populist sample), with rights-oriented populism only representing 18.04% of the populist respondents. Using these results, we examine associations between each type of populism and a series of political ideations. Statistics suggest that China’s rights-oriented populism is negatively correlated with system justification and national identification. In contrast, stronger responsibility-oriented populism associates with higher system justification, greater national identification, more satisfaction with life, and higher right-wing authoritarianism. Finally, implications for research on populism and on China’s public opinion are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Larger carnivores often trigger human-wildlife conflicts that arise from perceived threats to humans and domestic animals’ safety, which generate the need for management and removal strategies. These issues become especially challenging when humans and wildlife coexist close to one another, for example, in urban landscapes. African Crowned Eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) are powerful forest raptors that breed within the metropolitan green-space system of Durban and Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Negative human-wildlife interactions can occur because eagles occasionally predate on pets, such as cats (Felis catus) and small dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and provisioning domestic stock to nest sites has previously been quantified. Here, wildlife management becomes critical, usually aimed at reducing or eliminating causes of economic or social harm, but have to be balanced against conservation goals regarding threatened species. In this study, we (i) identified causes of harm or loss of Crowned Eagles because of injuries (n = 53 incidents; 31 mortalities); and (ii) describe interactions with negative perceptions to human livelihoods, particularly concerning predation on pets and livestock. Anthropogenic causes of mortality were more likely to be reported than remote natural deaths, which provides important opportunities for mitigation measures. Most avoidable are electrocution on utility poles, persecution via gunshot wounds and poisoning (targeted or secondary), while collisions with anthropogenic structures, such as glass panes, vehicles and fence wires, are more challenging to mitigate. Out of 44 verified Crowned Eagle vs. pets and livestock conflicts, we documented 19 dog attacks (2012–2020), with detrimental impacts on social perception and acceptance of urban eagles. Pet and livestock conflicts were primarily associated with juveniles and immature eagles (83%). Of these, 19% occurred during September alone, which marks the end of the post-fledging dependency period; 70% occurred outside the breeding season. We provide management recommendations regarding various categories of Crowned Eagle human-wildlife interactions. For example, activities such as rehabilitation and falconry can coordinate to achieve a high standard of public support and conservation outcomes for Crowned Eagles. Finally, we discuss using different management intervention strategies, including rehabilitation, falconry, re-wildling processes, and lethal control of specific “problem” individuals toward achieving the goal of sustainable, healthy Crowned Eagle populations that coexist with humans in urban landscapes.

AB  - Immigration is one of the most salient and important issues in contemporary American politics. While a great deal is known about how cultural attitudes and economics influence public opinion toward immigration, little is known about how attitudes toward government influence support for immigration. Using cross-sectional data from the American National Election Studies (ANES), panel data from the ANES and General Social Survey, as well a Mechanical Turk (MTurk) survey experiment, I show that political trust exerts a positive and substantively meaningful influence on Americans' support for immigration. Politically trustful individuals, both Democrats and Republicans, are more supportive of pro-immigration policies. These findings underscore the political relevance of trust in government and show that public attitudes toward immigration are not driven solely by feelings about immigrant groups, partisanship, core political values, nor personality traits, but are also affected by trust in government, the actor most responsible for managing immigration policy.

AB  - Public support for the welfare state - and the policies constituting it - has long been a topic of research. Previous research on support for redistribution has tended to focus on how either country-level characteristics (particularly those relating to the macro-economy such as levels of economic development or income inequality) or individual-level political factors (such as left-right political orientation and sociodemographic factors) shape support for redistribution. To date, empirical research has insufficiently tested how macroeconomic context and individual political orientations interact. Research has also obscured whether the effects of macroeconomic context hold cross-sectionally (across country contexts) or longitudinally (within countries over time). Drawing on data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), this article examines the cross-sectional (between-country) and longitudinal (within-country) interactive relationships involving economic development and income inequality (on one hand) and left-right political orientations (on the other) in shaping preferences for redistribution. Results indicate that there are larger left-right cleavages in attitudes in wealthier countries, more unequal countries, and countries where inequality is increasing. These findings challenge the dominant practice of focusing exclusively on additive effects of individual-level or country-level factors by showing the importance of paying attention to cross-level interactions. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - Background: Environment influences infant feeding decisions of mothers, which have influence on growth, development, health and nutrition of infants and children. Objectives: To assess the maternal knowledge and practices towards breast-feeding among mothers in Sohag. To correlate breast-feeding practices with maternal education, parity, mode of delivery, socioeconomic status and employment. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional study included 500 mothers of infants attending some primary health centers from 1st January to 30th November 2020. Data were collected using a self-administered standardized questionnaire. Results: Information present in this questionnaire were taken from 500 mothers, their information was founded to be taken from what friends (33%), media (10%) and primitives (57%). 52% of mothers knew that breast feeding was used as contraceptives. 63% of mothers agreed that babies breast fed naturally were healthier than those who breast feed artificially. 67%of mothers agreed that breast milk is useful but not satisfy the nutritional needs to sustain optimal growth beyond 6 months not due to decrease quality of breast milk but increased demand. Breast-feeding is related to educational level, parity, and socioeconomic status, in which (58%) and (80) of mothers had moderate educational level and moderate socioeconomic level respectively. Despite 61% of mothers disagree with the concept that they should stop nursing after only one year. Only 20% of them agreed to give bottle-feeding as complementary. Conclusion: It is really an encouraging observation that majority of the mothers had good knowledge and a positive attitude towards breast-feeding. Majority of the mothers fed the baby colostrum. Late initiation of breast-feeding has implications for health education programs and neonatal feeding strategies. © 2021, Ain Shams University Faculty of Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding public opinion towards immigrants is key to prevent acts of violence, discrimination and abuse. Traditional data sources, such as surveys, provide rich insights into the formation of such attitudes; yet, they are costly and offer limited temporal granularity, providing only a partial understanding of the dynamics of attitudes towards immigrants. Leveraging Twitter data and natural language processing, we propose a framework to measure attitudes towards immigration in online discussions. Grounded in theories of social psychology, the proposed framework enables the classification of users’ into profile stances of positive and negative attitudes towards immigrants and characterisation of these profiles quantitatively summarising users’ content and temporal stance trends. We use a Twitter sample composed of 36 K users and 160 K tweets discussing the topic in 2017, when the immigrant population in the country recorded an increase by a factor of four from 2010. We found that the negative attitude group of users is smaller than the positive group, and that both attitudes have different distributions of the volume of content. Both types of attitudes show fluctuations over time that seem to be influenced by news events related to immigration. Accounts with negative attitudes use arguments of labour competition and stricter regulation of immigration. In contrast, accounts with positive attitudes reflect arguments in support of immigrants’ human and civil rights. The framework and its application can inform policy makers about how people feel about immigration, with possible implications for policy communication and the design of interventions to improve negative attitudes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Integration of psychiatric care with public health services and offering mental health care services to patients from lower socioeconomic status remains a global challenge. Scarcity of funds and professional workforce in psychiatric hospitals contribute to this situation. However, negative attitudes in the population are also a known impediment to patients seeking mental health services. This study aimed to assess the attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals among the urban and rural population in India. Subjects and Methods: The study was carried out amongst the general population in Odisha, India. The total sample (n = 988) includes 496 respondents from an urban-setting, and 492 respondents from rural parts of the district. Participants were selected by using simple random-sampling from the Asian Institute of Public Health (AIPH) data base. A standardized seven-item questionnaire was adopted, with responses indicated on a 5-point Likert-scale. Interviews were fully structured and conducted face-to-face. Results: Level of education (B = −0.192, ß = −0.320, p < 0.000) and urban-rural comparison (B = −0.272, ß = −0.189, p < 0.000) significantly influenced attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals. Gender, age, and religious beliefs did not show any significant effect on attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals. Individuals in rural areas and those with lower education levels showed more negative attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals. Conclusion: Negative attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals from those living in rural areas as well as those with lesser education may be reflective of the lack of availability, accessibility, affordability, and credibility of such mental health services. The Mental Health Care Act in India is a progressive legislation which might improve the situation of the provided services and, consequently, reduce negative attitudes in the years to come. © Copyright © 2021 Jena, Zieger, Böge, Salunkhe, Schomerus, Patel, Padhi, Ta, Mungee and Hahn.

AB  - Health inequities are systemic, avoidable, and unjust differences in health between populations. These differences are often determined by social and structural factors, such as income and social status, employment and working conditions, or race/racism, which are referred to as the social determinants of health (SDOH). According to public opinion, health is considered to be largely determined by the choices and behaviours of individuals. However, evidence suggests that social and structural factors are the key determinants of health. There is likely a lack of public understanding of the role that social and structural factors play in determining health and producing health inequities. Public opinion and priorities can drive governmental action, so the aim of this work was to determine the most impactful way to increase knowledge and awareness about the social determinants of health (SDOH) and health inequities in the province of Ontario, Canada. A study to test the effectiveness of four different messaging styles about health inequities and the SDOH was conducted with a sample of 805 adult residents of Ontario. Findings show that messages highlighting the challenges faced by those experiencing the negative effects of the SDOH, while still acknowledging individual responsibility for health, were the most effective for eliciting an empathetic response from Ontarians. These findings can be used to inform public awareness campaigns focused on changing the current public narrative about the SDOH toward a more empathetic response, with the goal of increasing political will to enact policies to address health inequities in Ontario. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The current model of linear economy is causing accelerated consumption and an extensive use of natural resources that accentuates the effects of the current global environmental crisis. In this context, green products are becoming a key element in the transition to a sustainable consumption and production model. The main goal of this paper is to identify the factors predicting youth consumer satisfaction towards green products and to analyze the public perception of green brand products in Romania. Considering these goals, a questionnaire was developed and applied to 268 participants. The results show that a positive attitude towards green products and the level of information held by the consumers about them are significant predictors of green product satisfaction. Moreover, the importance of products being green significantly predicts the purchase of such products. Further implications and research directions are discussed towards the end. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A current shift in intergroup relations research aims to delve deeper into whether, and how, individual differences predict social attitudes. Recent research goes beyond the measurement of typical personality traits and focuses also on the subclinical area of malicious traits. The present studies aimed at exploring the role of one such trait, psychopathy, as a predictor of negative social attitudes. The role of empathy was examined as a key underlying process explaining the relationship between primary and secondary psychopathy and social attitudes. Study 1 (N = 171) and Study 2 (N = 332) demonstrated that when entered as simultaneous predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1) and racism (Study 2), only primary psychopathy emerged as a significant predictor. Study 1 further demonstrated that lower levels of empathy mediated the psychopathy—attitudes path. Study 2 decomposed empathy into cognitive and affective, and tested the explanatory role of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Primary psychopathy predicted lower cognitive and affective empathy, which sequentially predicted racism via SDO (in the case of cognitive empathy) and RWA (in the case of affective empathy). The results are discussed in the context of an integration between the personality and intergroup relations literature. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - National polls reveal stark and growing political divisions on the issue of climate change within the United States. However, few studies have explored whether these trends generalize to communities of color, who experience disproportionate environmental risks. Synthesizing over a decade of nationally representative survey data (2008–2019; N = 23,707), we conducted a conceptual replication and extension of previous research on the “racial/ethnic gap” in U.S. climate change opinion. Consistent with prior work, we find that African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos show less political polarization—including both weaker ideological and partisan divides—across a diverse range of belief, risk perception, and policy-support measures. Further, we find that this differential polarization has remained largely stable over time and is robust to effects of other sociodemographic variables, such as education and income. Notably, across the political spectrum, people of color were more likely to report that global warming poses a danger to themselves. Racial/ethnic differences were generally more pronounced among the political Right than the political Left, are generally larger for beliefs and risk perceptions (vs. policy support) and are only partially accounted for by racial/ethnic differences in ideology or party sorting. These results offer comprehensive evidence that climate change is less polarized among people of color in the U.S. Increasing diversity in the environmental sector and conducting more research on socio-cultural differences in environmental responses (including other racial/ethnic groups and indigenous populations) is important to promoting equity in decision-making, addressing environmental disparities, and potentially bridging growing political divides in the U.S. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The 21st century has highlighted major dilemmas on how to best manage diversity in our increasingly plural societies. Various strategies for managing diversity have been promoted to address this challenge including assimilation, colorblindness, and multiculturalism. However, empirical evidence has revealed that each poses weaknesses for intergroup relations. As a result, policy-makers and political theorists have promoted interculturalism as an alternate strategy that addresses new and emerging realities revolving around superdiversity, cultural fusions, and mixed forms of identity. In the current paper, we explore interculturalism as a pro-diversity ideology that takes a more dynamic view of cultural identity where individuals belonging to different social groups are supported to interact and influence each other leading to new and complex self-understandings. We consider the meaning and conceptualization of interculturalism, its psychological correlates, its implications for intergroup relations, and how minority group members perceive interculturalism. Given that empirical research on interculturalism is in its infancy, we further consider gaps in our understanding of the topic and suggest avenues for future research. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Indonesia is the largest island country in the world with diverse ethnicity and cultural backgrounds. This study aimed to understand the variation in attitudes toward epilepsy among the Javanese, Sundanese, and the Minahasa ethnic groups in Indonesia. Method: This study recruited Sundanese from Tasikmalaya and Minahasan from Manado using the Indonesian Public Attitudes Toward Epilepsy (PATE) scale. The results were compared to the Javanese and Malaysian data in previous studies. Result: A total of 200 respondents, 100 from each ethnic group were recruited, with a mean age of 38.51 years. They were predominantly females (54%) and had secondary education level or lower (56.67%). The Javanese had a higher total mean score, indicating poorer attitudes toward epilepsy, as compared to the Minahasan and Sundanese groups. These differences were noted in the personal domain, but not the general domain. There were no significant differences in the mean scores in both personal and general domains between the Minahasan, Sundanese, and Malaysian populations. Subanalysis on the aspects of life showed that the Javanese had a significantly higher score in the aspects of education, marital relationship, and employment. Conclusion: The attitudes toward epilepsy were similar between the Indonesian (Sundanese and the Minahasan) and Malaysian, except the Javanese with poorer attitude. These differences could be socioeconomically or culturally related. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Intersectionality scholars have long identified dynamic configurations of race and gender ideologies. Yet, survey research on racial and gender attitudes tends to treat these components as independent. We apply latent class analysis to a set of racial and gender attitude items from the General Social Survey (1977 to 2018) to identify four configurations of individuals’ simultaneous views on race and gender. Two of these configurations hold unified progressive or regressive racial and gender attitudes. The other two formations have discordant racial and gender attitudes, where progressive views on one aspect combine with regressive views on the other. In the majority of survey years, the most commonly held configuration endorsed gender equality but espoused new racialist views that attributed racial disparities to cultural deficiencies. This perspective has become increasingly common since 1977 and is most prevalent among White women and White men, likely due to racial-group interest. Black women and Black men, in contrast, are more likely to embrace progressive racial and gender attitudes. We argue that White men’s gender egalitarianism may be rooted in self-interest, aimed at acquiring resources through intimate relationships. In contrast, Black men adopt progressive racial and gender attitudes to form a necessary coalition with Black women to challenge racism. © American Sociological Association 2021.

AB  - The last decades have seen the emergence of a divide pitting the new left against the far right in advanced democracies. We study how this universalism-particularism divide is crystallizing into a full-blown cleavage, complete with structural, political and identity elements. So far, little research exists on the identities that voters themselves perceive as relevant for drawing in- and out-group boundaries along this divide. Based on an original survey from Switzerland, a paradigmatic case of electoral realignment, we show that voters’ “objective” socio-demographic characteristics relate to distinctive, primarily culturally connoted identities. We then inquire into the degree to which these group identities have been politicized, that is, whether they divide new left and far right voters. Our results strongly suggest that the universalism-particularism “cleavage” not only bundles issues, but shapes how people think about who they are and where they stand in a group conflict that meshes economics and culture. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Historical trends seem to show that populism, defined here as movements that self-identify as representatives of a unified good people confronting a corrupted or malevolent elite, tends to co-occur with major economic disruptions. However, research into this connection provides us with a puzzle: while populist surges often come in the wake of economic crises, cultural variables tend to be better predictors of support for populism in public opinion surveys. In this article, we develop a theory (affective political economy) that can resolve this paradox by analyzing the influence of emotions on politics. Using survey experiments, we show that economic crises cause emotional reactions that activate cultural discontent. This, in turn, activates populist attitudes. This article provides an elegant solution to a major impasse in the study of the demand side of populism and provides a useful way of analyzing how economics and culture may interact to cause political outcomes. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - How do social identities contribute to the formation of coalitions in a policy subsystem? Social identities help to understand the bundling of resources and common strategies for action. Thus, we argue that identification with a group and across groups discursively results in the formulation of shared and competing storylines. As coalitions are characterized by some kind of sameness of their actors which results in shared storylines, we thereby postulate that the link between storylines and social identities provides added value to the explanation of coalition formation. We test whether shared storylines can be traced back to social identities in the different discursive periods of traffic development on a local level in Germany. A media analysis of 110 articles and 14 interviews shows that the assignment of certain group characteristics is discursively confirmed, renegotiated, or rejected. Social identities, therefore, matter for coalition formation. Related Articles: Chang, Katherine T., and Elizabeth A. Koebele. 2020. “What Drives Coalitions' Narrative Strategy?

AB  - What determines electoral support for national incumbent parties and state-level challengers in sub-national pro-poor contexts? Based on survey data from the Indian states of Kerala and West Bengal, collected prior to the 2019 national election, we find that voters were more (less) inclined to vote for the sub-national incumbent relative to the national incumbent if their household economic conditions were perceived to have improved (deteriorated) relative to national economic conditions. Our findings indicate that voters in these settings correctly assume that the sub-national incumbent cannot be held responsible for changes in national economic conditions, but, at the same time, the existence of a strong welfare state at the sub-national level creates expectations that the sub-national government is responsible for personal welfare. Hence, the national election is used to assess the economic performance of both the sub-national and the national incumbent. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Racial tensions continue to ignite social unrest in the United States. Structural racism is increasingly recognized as a public health issue. It is therefore necessary to continue addressing the interaction of race and medicine, including anesthesiology. While many may overlook the impact that racial discrimination has had on the development of anesthesiology, understanding pain through a racialized lens has always been entwined with this medical specialty since its origins. Considering the first public demonstration of ether anesthesia in 1846 occurred 15 years before the American Civil War (1861-1865), it is naïve to pretend that anesthesia has been insulated from racial prejudice. We increasingly recognize the effects of variables, such as housing and education, which are important as social determinants of health. Across ethnic and racial lines, statistically significant differences persist in pain assessment and analgesia delivery. To understand these irregularities without relying on unsupported theories, we must challenge our current understanding of race in medicine. By reviewing the history of anesthesia through a racialized lens, we may better explore our biases and develop strategies towards racially equitable care. This article focuses on anesthesia's roots on the plantation in the American South, the medical perpetuation of racial disparities, and the challenges we face in healthcare today. © 2021 National Medical Association

AB  - Background: At the same time that federal policymakers have enforced restrictive immigration policies, healthcare systems across the USA are developing, and have implemented, interventions aimed at addressing immigration-related stressors faced by immigrant communities. Yet, little is known about the contextual determinants that influence their implementation success. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), this study identifies factors enabling or challenging the implementation of interventions aimed at mitigating immigration-related stressors in the healthcare context. Methods: We used a qualitative research design to conduct 38 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders involved in implementation of interventions at 25 healthcare facilities across 5 states with the highest undocumented immigrant populations (California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Illinois). Interviews were conducted from May through August 2018. Constant comparative analysis was used to identify barrier and facilitator themes. Deductive coding was thereafter used to categorize themes according to CFIR domain. Results: Barriers to implementation included perceptions of legal complexity and challenges to adopting such systemic strategies. Facilitators included a national policy climate that had brought immigrant health to the forefront, allowing for leveraging momentum towards institutional change; communication among healthcare personnel; existing community partnerships with immigrant rights and service organizations; and a shared sense of mission centering health equity. Local variation in immigration-related policies (e.g., local law agencies enforcing federal immigration laws) and heterogeneity of local immigrant communities also impacted implementation. Champions and informal leaders were integral to institutional efforts but not sufficient for sustainability. Perceived urgency to act superseded evaluation considerations, with all interventions in initial phases of implementation. Future iterations and evaluations of these interventions are needed to establish best practices and implementation determinants. Conclusion: This is the first systematic study describing implementation determinants of immigration-related interventions across health systems. Identifying these determinants provides guidance to other healthcare organizations to effectively strategize and ensure implementation success. © 2021, Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - Past research has shown the Southern United States to have more conservative immigration attitudes compared to more established immigrant destination states. However, it is unclear whether or not the places that immigrants have arrived share these conservative attitudes and how this impacts the reception of immigrant groups. Analyzing the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, I find that U.S.-born White attitudes toward immigration are less conservative in zip codes where immigrant-origin groups in the South are most likely to live, often by substantial margins. This indicates that immigrant-origin groups in the South are likely to encounter Southern Whites with a more liberal orientation than Southern Whites more generally. The implications for how these attitudes compare to established immigrant destination states and counties are addressed in detail, as are Southern Black attitudes toward immigration. Regardless, on various questions approximating racial experience/understanding, immigrant-origin groups in the South do not report more negative feelings than those in established destinations and report more positive feelings in some cases, although these results could also indicate a lower awareness of racial issues. Overall, these findings point to a context of reception in the South that is likely more positive than past research on Southern immigration attitudes has implied. © The Southern Sociological Society 2021.

AB  - Migration elicits mixed reactions from the host-society. Negative responses towards migrants seem to emerge when migrants are perceived as culturally different. We investigated when and why perceived cultural distance (PCD) is associated with negative migrant attitudes by focussing on differences in cultural values. We expected that PCD in social values (focus on relationships and society) should be more strongly associated with attitudes towards migrants than personal values (individual needs and gains) and should be mediated by symbolic threat. In two quasi-experimental studies (N = 200, N = 668) with Dutch participants (host-society), we simultaneously tested effects of respondents’ perception of Dutch values, their perceptions of migrant values (of Moroccan, Syrian, Polish ethnic origin), and PCD between Dutch-migrant value on attitudes. For all migrant groups, PCD in social values was associated with more negative attitudes, less tolerance, and less policy support regarding migrants; this was mediated by symbolic threat. These links were weaker for personal values. © 2021 The Authors. British Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Psychological Society

AB  - Automation has permeated workplaces and threatens labour in the production process. Concurrently, European governments have expanded workfare which imposes stringent conditions and sanctions on unemployed workers after the onset of austerity. We explore how automation risk affects workfare support. Recent research finds that most routine workers ‘survive’ in their routine jobs. Despite avoiding unemployment, routine workers may face the threat of status decline as automation erodes the value of routine work. They may respond by differentiating themselves from lower-ranked social groups such as unemployed workers. Such boundary drawing may manifest views that the unemployed are less deserving of welfare. We thus posit that routine workers may support workfare to assuage their fears of status decline. We further explore if worsening economic hardship, proxied as rising unemployment rates over time, increases their support for workfare. We conducted pooled and multilevel analyses using data from the European Social Survey. We find that routine workers significantly support workfare. We also find that routine workers support workfare when economic hardship worsens, but oppose it when conditions ameliorate. Findings suggest that status threat is an important channel by which automation risk may affect workfare support, but its impact depends on social context, hence yielding country-differences. Worsening economic hardship may exacerbate routine workers’ status decline fears, and intensify their harsh views against unemployed workers. Automation risk may thus have a greater impact on workfare support under such conditions. Policymakers can use these findings to assess how workfare may be publicly received and under various economic conditions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In intractable conflicts, what factors lead populations to accept negotiated outcomes? To examine these issues, we conduct a survey experiment on a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population and a companion experiment on a representative sample of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. We find that holding the negotiated settlement outcome constant, approval of the settlement is strongly influenced by whether it is framed as a negotiating defeat for one side—if and only if respondents are primed to be indignant—and that these effects are strongly mediated by perceptions of the fairness of the settlement outcome. Moral indignation produces a desire for concessions for concession’s sake. Such conflicts over political framing violate assumptions of the rationalist literature on conflict processes and suggest important new directions for conflict theorizing. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - How do major national events influence attitudes toward non-nationals? Recent research suggests that national sports team wins help foster national pride, weaken ethnic attachments, and build trust among conational out-group members. This paper asks a related question: By heightening nationalism, do these victories also affect attitudes toward foreign out-groups, specifically refugees? We examine this question using the 2019 Africa Cup football match between Kenya and Tanzania, which Kenya narrowly won, coupled with an online survey experiment conducted with a panel of 2,647 respondents recruited through Facebook. We find that winning increases national pride and preferences for resource allocation toward conationals, but it also leads to negative views of refugees’ contribution to the country’s diversity. However, we present experimental evidence that reframing national sports victories as a product of cooperation among diverse players and highlighting shared superordinate identities can offset these views and help foster positive attitudes toward refugees. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are often explained in terms of ethnic boundaries in which a categorical distinction between the ethnic ingroup and immigrant outgroup is made. However, these attitudes might also result from contrasting cultural worldviews. We examined the importance of ethnic categorisation and perceived cultural worldview difference in explaining behavioural intentions towards immigrants. Using an experimental survey design with a national sample of ethnic Dutch respondents (N = 832), we studied two positive and two negative behavioural intentions towards either immigrants with a contrasting cultural worldview or co-ethnics with such as worldview. Our findings indicate similar behavioural intentions towards both target groups. Furthermore, except for “the intention to learn” there were no differences in behavioural intentions towards both target groups for respondents with lower and higher authoritarian dispositions. Overall, this pattern of findings is theoretically most in line with a worldview conflict perspective rather than an ethnic boundary perspective. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Many students report negative attitudes toward research methods and statistics (RMS), and these attitudes are associated with impaired performance. Student interest in clinical psychology suggests that clinical courses may provide a promising venue for integrating RMS instruction. This approach may be particularly valuable for students from underrepresented groups in psychology. Objective: We evaluated whether integrating core RMS concepts into undergraduate clinical psychology courses using a blended learning intervention improved students’ quantitative knowledge and attitudes. Exploratory analyses assessed whether the intervention had differential efficacy for students from underrepresented groups. Method: Students completed pre- and post-course assessments of content knowledge, perceived RMS competence, implicit theories of quantitative skills, and statistics anxiety. We compared changes in student outcomes before (n = 101) and after (n = 91) implementing the blended learning intervention. Results: Overall, the intervention did not result in greater improvements in content knowledge, perceived RMS competence, or statistics anxiety. However, exploratory analyses suggested that the intervention was more effective for first-generation and racial/ethnic minority students. Change in endorsement of a growth-oriented mindset for quantitative skills was marginally stronger among students in courses implementing the blended learning intervention. Conclusion: These findings suggest that integrating RMS content in clinical psychology courses may confer modest benefits for students’ knowledge and attitudes toward quantitative skills, especially among students from underrepresented groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This survey experiment examined the role of prejudice and moral licensing as two moderators of the secondary transfer effect (STE) of positive and negative intergroup contact. We collected a quota-randomized sample of 299 majority Finns (52.6% female; experimental condition: n = 118, control condition: n = 181) in order to test whether moral credentials prevent attitude generalization (from primary towards secondary outgroup), particularly among prejudiced individuals. The results showed that STEs of both positive and negative contact were prevented among more prejudiced majority group members who had the possibility to obtain moral credentials in the moral licensing task. These results point at the unstable nature of attitude generalization in STE among prejudiced individuals and at the potential of a normative moral act to intervene into the generalization of intergroup attitudes following intergroup contact. We discuss these findings in relation to the literature on moral licensing and moral reinforcement, framing them in the context of an integration of contact research and research on morality in general. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Tempers flared in Europe in response to the 2015 European Refugee Crisis, prompting some countries to totally close their borders to asylum seekers. This was seen to have fueled anti-immigrant sentiment, which grew in Europe along with the support for far-right political parties that had previously languished. This sparked a flurry of research into the relationship between immigration and far-right voting, which has found mixed and nuanced evidence of immigration increasing far-right support in some cases, while decreasing support in others. To provide more evidence to this unsettled debate in the empirical literature, we use data from over 400 European parties to systematically select cases of individual countries. We augment this with a cross-country quantitative study. Our analysis finds little evidence that immigrant populations are related to changes in voting for the right. Our finding gives evidence that factors other than immigration are the true cause of rises in right-wing voting. © 2021 Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is one of the causes of maternal deaths and is also responsible for complications such as premature births worldwide. In South Africa, hypertensive disorders cause 14% of all maternal deaths. Evidence indicates that it may be beneficial to empower women to monitor their blood pressure (BP) in the comfort of their homes. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore and describe preeclampsia patients' knowledge and attitudes towards the self-monitoring of their BP. METHOD: An exploratory, descriptive and contextual qualitative research study was conducted. Fourteen preeclampsia patients were purposively sampled and participated in the study. In-depth semi-structured interviews were used to collect data. Data were analysed using the thematic analytic approach. RESULTS: The knowledge and attitudes towards the self-monitoring of blood pressure (SMBP) were explored. Four themes emerged, namely understanding of hypertension disorders during pregnancy, openness on self-monitoring at home, its hindrances and benefits. The participants portrayed limited understanding and knowledge of preeclampsia, yet they had positive attitudes towards monitoring BP themselves and were open and willing to do self-monitoring at home. CONCLUSION: The use of SMBP may relieve overcrowding in public healthcare institutions. Encouraging patients to participate in self-monitoring could promote active participation and a positive outlook on their pregnancies. The unavailability and unaffordability of the equipment may pose a challenge to women with a low socioeconomic status.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Menopause is a natural stage of the reproductive life of a woman. This natural event might affect activities of daily living and cause problems for women. Positive attitudes toward menopause can improve women's quality of life and reduce the severity of menopausal symptoms. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the factors influencing women's attitudes toward menopause. EVIDENCE REVIEW: This systematic review was conducted based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline in medical databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar, as well as Magiran, and SID until October 2020. FINDINGS: A total of 7,512 articles were identified. Eight articles were included in the review after excluding the duplicates and screening the articles based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The majority of the studies used the Attitude Toward Menopause Scale to assess the attitudes toward menopause. This variable differed between the studies conducted in different regions and countries. Furthermore, postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes toward menopause compared with peri- or premenopausal women. Other influencing factors of attitudes toward menopause included age, menopausal symptoms, psychological and socioeconomical status, and profession and ethnicity. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings showed that menopausal stage, menopausal symptoms, and psychological and socioeconomic status can influence the attitude of women toward menopause. Therefore, these factors should be considered in interventions that aim to improve women's attitudes toward menopause. Copyright © 2021 by The North American Menopause Society.

AB  - Rationale: India and the USA, the worst affected countries by COVID-19, experienced very different pandemic courses. By 2020, COVID-19 cases had steadily declined in India, whereas the fight continued in the US. The people of India and the USA perhaps perceived threats very differently, influenced by their knowledge, available healthcare facilities, and social security. We conducted an online survey study to compare COVID-related perceptions between Indian participants (IND-P) and US-based participants (US-P). Methods: COVID-related perceptions such as stress, knowledge, and preventive behaviors were measured with specific questionnaires, and normalized scores were computed. T-tests were used to compare the perception scores, while the Kruskal-Wallis-H (KWH) tests were used to compare socioeconomic distributions between participants from two countries. Generalized linear model (GLM) adjusted for sociodemographic confounders estimated the association between the country of residence and COVID-perception. Results: The IND-P (N = 242) were younger and male-dominated compared with the US-P (N = 531) (age: KWH = 97.37, p < 0.0001, gender: KWH = 140.38, p < 0.0001). Positive attitudes toward preventive guidelines were associated with higher perceived risk and stress (r = 0.35, p < 0.001, and r = 0.21, p < 0.001, respectively) but not with the knowledge (r = −0.05, p = 0.14). Compared with the US-P, the IND-P had lower knowledge (5.19 ± 1.95 vs. 7.82 ± 1.35; t-test: p < 0.0001), higher stress (7.01 ± 1.51 vs. 6.07 ± 1.61; t-test: p < 0.0001), and better adherence to preventive guidelines (8.84 ± 1.30 vs. 8.34 ± 2.09; t-test: p = 0.0006). GLM demonstrated a significant association between the country and COVID-perception scores. Conclusion: The IND-P experienced higher stress and perceived threat during COVID-19 than the US-P, perhaps due to a lack of faith in the healthcare system and insecurity. Despite lower knowledge, the IND-P had better acceptance of preventive guidelines than the US-P. © Copyright © 2021 Sinharoy, Pal, Das and Mondal.

AB  - Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: Compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - HIV is perceived as a taboo topic in Iranian culture. This study examined HIV-related stigma among Iranian people living with HIV (PLWH). This cross-sectional study was conducted among 123 PLWH in 2019. HIV-related stigma was assessed by a standardized questionnaire adapted into Persian for this study. The range of the stigma scores for each of the subscales (personalized stigma, negative self-image, disclosure concerns, and concerns about public attitudes) was 3-12, whereas the range for the total stigma score was 12-48. The highest and lowest mean scores were observed in concerns about public attitudes (10.07) and negative self-image (7.39). The total mean stigma score was 37.03, indicating a high level of stigma. The most important factors determining HIV-related stigma were socioeconomic status, transmission method, duration of disease, and education level. This study suggests the need for more effective interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma among Iranian PLWH. © 2021 Elsevier USA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using a cross-national representative survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine predictors of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration in Canada and the United States, including general and COVID-related nationalism, patriotism, and perceived personal and national economic and health threats. In both countries, nationalism, particularly COVID-related nationalism, predicted perceptions that immigration levels were too high and negative attitudes toward immigrants. Patriotism predicted negative immigration attitudes in the United States but not in Canada, where support for immigration and multiculturalism are part of national identity. Conversely, personal and national economic threat predicted negative immigration attitudes in Canada more than in the United States. In both countries, national health threat predicted more favorable views of immigration levels and attitudes toward immigrants, perhaps because many immigrants have provided frontline health care during the pandemic. Country-level cognition in context drives immigration attitudes and informs strategies for supporting more positive views of immigrants and immigration. © 2021 by The American Academy of Political and Social Science.

AB  - Front-of-package labeling (FOPL) is a policy tool that helps consumers to make informed food choices. South Africa has not yet implemented this labeling system. The aim of this study was therefore to explore adult South African consumers’ perceptions of front-of-package warning labels on foods and non-alcoholic beverages (referred to as drinks in this paper) and their insights into features that could influence the effectiveness of the warning label. Using a qualitative approach, the study purposively selected consumers diversified by urbanization, gender, socioeconomic status, and literacy. We collected data from a total of 113 participants through 12 focus group discussions. Data were systematically coded and divided into five themes namely, positive attitudes toward warning labels, perceived benefits of warning labels, perceived behavior modification, perceived beneficiaries of warning labels, and effective attributes of warning labels. Almost all participants from all socio-economic backgrounds were positive about warning labels, reporting that warning labels concisely and understandably educated them about the nutritional composition of foods. Other perceived advantages were that warning labels warn of health implications, are easily understandable and could benefit child health. Some participants anticipated that warning labels would reduce their purchases of unhealthy foods, while others thought the labels would have no effect on their purchasing habits. Participants found the warning labels attention grabbing and stated that they preferred a black triangle placed on a white background (referred to as a holding strap henceforth), the words “high in” and “warning” in bold and uppercase text, an exclamation mark, and an icon depicting the excessive nutrient. In South Africa warning labels may improve consumer understanding of nutrition information and assist consumers in determining the nutritional quality of packaged foods and drinks. © 2021 Bopape et al.

AB  - Circular economy (CE) has been globally acknowledged as a national sustainable development (SD) strategy to confront resource shortages and environmental contamination challenges. Although public behaviors and lifestyles play an essential role in achieving sustainability, in developing countries, few studies explored the role of public awareness, attitudes, and lifestyles on CE transition. Thus, it is necessary to elicit public opinion to understand their awareness and attitude regarding CE strategy to determine obstacles to CE implementation and approaches of overcoming them. This study thus focuses on understanding public awareness and attitudes to CE transition in Saudi Arabia. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 402 residents of the Dammam Metropolitan Area. The results indicated that the respondents had little understanding of the CE concept due to limited awareness of the topic. However, they held an optimistic attitude towards trash separation and classified their trash as “can be sold”, “reused”, and “exchanged for a new one”. Furthermore, the respondents’ level of awareness regarding the CE transition is positively related to their level of education. In contrast, the inclination towards resource conservation and pro-environmental behavior positively correlates to the age demographic. This paper thus contributes to the empirical literature on CE transition by exploring the public awareness and attitudes towards its implementation in Saudi Arabia. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this article, we review the theoretical and empirical literature on racial microaggressions from 2007 to 2020 (N = 138 articles). First, we refine racial microaggressions theory and update the definition to address mischaracterizations in the literature and clarify the term (i.e., “micro” refers to microlevel interactions rather than degree of harm). Next, we used four superordinate categories (i.e., pathologizing differences, denigrating and pigeonholing, excluding or rendering invisible, and perpetuating color-blind racial attitudes) in which to situate racial microaggression themes from the extant literature. Moreover, we consolidated and renamed existing themes to privilege targets’ perspectives (e.g., facing assumptions of inferior status and enduring exoticization). We then synthesized qualitative and quantitative research that shows harmful sequelae of racial microaggressions (i.e., psychological and physiological symptoms). Extending prior research on coping with gendered racial microaggressions, we describe empirical findings on collective, resistance, and self-protective strategies to mitigate the harmful impact of racial microaggressions. We conclude with directions for future research. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Despite significant advances in research on racial microaggressions, key challenges remain regarding how to define and classify them. Resolving these challenges is necessary to reduce misunderstanding and the subsequent minimization of racial microaggression research. Our goals in this article are to discuss the definitional challenges, to discuss implications for the creation of taxonomies, and to offer directions for how a revised definition and corresponding taxonomies can be used to further racial microaggression research. Regarding our first aim, we assert that racial microaggressions are observable events that occur independently of intention (i.e., regardless of whether they are intentional or unintentional) or impact (i.e., regardless of how they are perceived by recipients). Moreover, we assert that racial microaggressions are most validly defined by people of color and can have different meanings on the basis of situational context. The second aim is to propose a refinement and expansion of racial microaggression taxonomies. Sue and colleagues’ taxonomy has been invaluable, yet other ways of classifying microaggressions and moving toward dimensional taxonomies are needed to advance scholarship. We highlight key dimensions related to the experience, perpetration, characteristics, and sociopolitical function of racial microaggressions that may be useful for future taxonomies. Overall, overcoming definitional challenges and expanding taxonomies holds potential to advance the literature on racial microaggression. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This initial investigation aimed to investigate the knowledge of the health benefits of physical activity (PA) and attitudes towards participation in PA. The study recruited 307 people aged 30–75 years with hypertension as part of a cluster randomized controlled trial from a rural area in Bangladesh. Of the 307 participants, 135 participated less than 2.5 h of physical activity per week, from which we collected data on attitudes toward PA. Regression analysis and Rasch analysis were used. More than 85% of homemakers, employees or businesspersons were willing to take part in PA. Based on the combined score from the knowledge and attitude items, 46% of people endorsed PA programs; proportions were higher in men than women (53% vs. 41%). After adjusting for covariates, men (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.50, 1.72–7.11) compared to women and people with at least primary levels of schooling (OR 3.06, 95% CI, 1.27–7.38) compared with those with no education were more likely to organize or take part in any PA programs. People have positive attitudes towards PA but do not feel obligated to participate in PA programs. Future programs are needed to promote awareness and motivational interventions for PA, especially targeting women and people with low education levels, should be developed and implemented. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - While research on right-wing and religious-islamist motivated extremism has increased in recent years, the same is not the case for left-wing extremism. This study examines specific risk and protective factors of left-wing extremism. Using an online questionnaire, we studied a sample of 144 potential extremists, which we recruited via left leaning and extremist left-wing groups. The focus in our study was on aggressive and violent behavior (not only on attitudes). 51 % of our participants were male with a mean age of M = 26.74 (SD = 6.11). 92 had engaged in politically motivated violence towards property and/or persons. We examined theoretically relevant constructs on the individual level and in the social environment. A hierarchical regression analysis »explained« about 50 % of the variance regarding politically motivated violence. Positive integration into a violent extremist social environment was related to politically motivated violence. A personal criminal history predicted engagement as well. Perceptions of procedural justice and legitimacy were identified as a protective factor. In an exploratory discriminant analysis, we also examined differences between those who were »only« involved in violence towards objects (others' property) and those who were also involved in violence towards persons. Positive attitudes towards the use of extremist violence were important in predicting group membership. The results are considered in light of current research and strengths as well as limitations are discussed. More empirical research on left-wing extremism is necessary, especially studies using longitudinal designs. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Open political debate on immigration and integration policies (IIP) among Canadian political parties has been relatively limited. As Canada's immigration and integration systems become more decentralized, what about political debates about IIP in Canadian provinces? This article examines how IIP evolved across time by focusing on political parties' claims, frames and pledges in party platforms and newspapers, using the cases of Ontario and Quebec. In Ontario, IIP were primarily framed as an economic and social resource. However, following the event of 9/11, new frames began to be introduced, contributing to a heightened salience and polarization. In contrast to Quebec, however, this politicization was not sustained. In Quebec, IIP were only marginally a matter of debate until the mid-2000s. This changed following the Hérouxville event, as these topics became salient, and dominant frames of immigration as economic and social resources were challenged by those of immigration as economic and cultural threats. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - Cultural globalization affects most people around the world in contemporary, modern societies. The resulting intercultural contact have been examined using the theory of globalization-based acculturation. However, little is known about possible differences and similarities in processes underlying the effects of direct (e.g., through contact with immigrants) and indirect (e.g., engagement with cultural elements through media) forms of new cultural exposure. Drawing on the contact hypothesis, social identity theory, and symbolic threat theory, we examined whether perceived intercultural threat and local and global identities would explain whether both forms of contact result in multicultural acquisition or in ethnic protection. In Study 1 (N = 402), indirect, but not direct, intercultural contact was positively associated with multicultural acquisition; and both types of intercultural contact were negatively linked with ethnic protection. Global identity significantly mediated the association of both direct and indirect intercultural contact with both multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection, whereas perceived cultural threat only significantly mediated the associations of direct intercultural contact with multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection. In Study 2 (N = 424), higher levels of ethnic protection, and lower levels of multicultural acquisition, emerged in the experimental group primed with indirect, versus direct, intercultural contact. Furthermore, intercultural threat was negatively, and global identity positively, associated with multicultural acquisition, while intercultural threat was positively, and global identity negatively, associated with ethnic protection. Results are discussed in relation to similarities and differences across direct and indirect intercultural contact, providing a nuanced understanding of contemporary intercultural contact and globalization-based acculturation among majority populations. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - According to the economy-environment trade-off, good economic conditions raise citizens' concerns about the environment, while economic recessions reduce the interest. This paper explores this hypothesis in print media and considers the quantitative media coverage of deforestation in three English-language newspapers between 1995 and 2015. The empirical findings reject the economy-environment trade-off and show that print media coverage of deforestation exhibits a modest but significant increase during economic downturns and slows down in case of good economic conditions. The mass media can reflect public opinion on major environmental issues but at the same time, tend to influence public opinion selecting and framing newsworthy issues. A stable media attention on deforestation issues, even during economic recessions, can contribute to create public support and legitimization for ambitious environmental policies aimed at governing forest conservation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently, there has been growing focus on the intergroup influences of acculturation preferences, and in particular majority members’ perceptions of how minority members want to acculturate. This paper contributes to this emergent literature by examining the extent to which majority members in the UK perceive that minority members’ preferences for heritage culture maintenance and majority culture adoption are conflicting, and whether this is moderated by perceived threat. One hundred and sixty-three participants who self-reported being white British completed an online survey. Participants were asked about their perceptions of minority acculturation preferences for two target groups living in the UK: Pakistani and German minority groups. Overall, perceived culture maintenance and perceived culture adoption were weakly negatively associated for both groups. Moreover, results confirmed the pre-registered hypotheses, but only for the Pakistani target group. At higher levels of perceived threat, perceived culture maintenance was related to less perceived culture adoption. However, when threat was low, there was no association between perceived heritage culture maintenance and perceived culture adoption. For the German target group, threat did not moderate the relationship between perceived culture maintenance and perceived culture adoption. Findings suggest that depending on levels of perceived threat and the minority group in question, majority members perceiving that minority members maintain their heritage culture has different consequences. Results are discussed in relation to implications for integration, intergroup relations in culturally plural societies, and the need to focus on specific minority groups when studying acculturation processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to develop and initially validate a psychometrically sound instrument to assess the extent to which Latinx immigrants are viewed as a threat. Method: Drawing on the integrated threat theory (ITT), we developed an initial pool of scale items to represent realistic and symbolic threats. Following best practices in scale construction, we used exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis to identify, calibrate, and cross-validate the scale structure. A triadic random split of the sample (N5958) of U.S.-born white college students was used to carry out the three-stage study. Results: Across all stages, findings support the unidimensionality of the 12-item Latinx Immigrant Threat Attitudes Scale (LITAS). Offering evidence of criterion validity, higher LITAS scores were associated with lower support for policies integrating unauthorized immigrants. Conclusions: The LITAS fills a significant gap in the measurement literature. The instrument supports the design and testing of interventions aimed at improving intergroup relations and the lived experience of Latinx immigrants in the United States. Contrary to the widely-used ITT, an undifferentiated, global notion of threat perception is salient; the implications of empirical divergence from the ITT are discussed. © 2021 Society for Social Work and Research.

AB  - There is little research examining the gender gap in public opinion among Americans of African descent. Amid emerging evidence that Black men are more conservative than Black women, there is reason to believe there may be gender differences in their policy preferences. We use the 1980-2016 cumulative ANES data to observe when racial and gender considerations will be more salient for Black women in determining their policy preferences. We find no gender gap on race-based policies suggesting racial group interests may be driving similar support among Black men and women. We do find gender differences on women’s issues and social welfare policies. We attribute Black women’s support for women’s issues to their gendered interests and demonstrate the gap in social welfare attitudes is mediated by their lower economic status relative to Black men. Despite these differences, we discover that Black men and women support race-oriented and social welfare policies more than either white men or women. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value-support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value-support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value-support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value-support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - How can incumbent governments benefit when they control the timing of elections? The conventional wisdom is that incumbents gain an advantage by timing elections to coincide with favorable economic conditions. An alternative mechanism that has received less attention is the element of surprise: the incumbent’s ability to exploit the opposition’s lack of election preparedness. I theorize and empirically test this surprise mechanism using candidate-level data from Japanese House of Representatives elections (1955–2017). The results show that in surprise elections, opposition parties recruit fewer, lower-quality candidates, spend less money campaigning, coordinate their candidates less effectively, and ultimately receive fewer votes and seats. Evidence from fixed effects models and exogenously timed by-elections further suggest that surprise matters more in shorter, competitive election campaigns and helps incumbents more with confronting inter-party as opposed to intra-party electoral competition. These findings add to our understanding of how strategic election timing can undermine electoral accountability. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The current study examined intergroup-related and social-cognitive correlates of bystanders' acceptability judgements and their responses to bias-based bullying of immigrant peers and to possible retaliation for the bullying. Participants included 179 immigrant-origin and non-immigrant-origin youth (Mage = 13.23; SD = 1.55; 79 immigrant-origin youth). Participants' bystander judgements and responses to bullying and retaliation were examined via a hypothetical scenario. Further, participants' intergroup attitudes towards immigrants and their social-cognitive skills were evaluated. ANOVA results showed that immigrant-origin youth judged bullying as less acceptable and retaliation as more acceptable compared to non-immigrant-origin youth, documenting that group membership is related to adolescents' judgements. A similar pattern was observed in active bystander responses. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that immigration background, intergroup process in the context of immigration, and social-cognitive skills predict bystander responses to bullying and retaliation. This study provides important implications for anti-bullying intervention programmes to overcome the negative consequences of retaliation in the escalation of aggressive behaviours. © 2021 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Turkey hosts the largest Syrian refugee population in the world. As an attempt to understand antecedents of residents attitudes towards Syrian refugees, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between contact experience, perception of threat, and the attitudes. Specifically, we hypothesized that perception of threat would mediate the relationship between contact experience and the attitudes. Frequency of different contact types, threats associated with economic, cultural, and criminal risks, and attitudes towards male or female targets based on preferred social distance were subjected to analyses in an adult sample of 170 women and 183 men. Results revealed a full mediation effect both for female and male Syrian refugee targets. We discussed the findings referring the observed nature of contact as mostly being casual, threat level being high, and attitudes being relatively negative within a specific media-effects framework. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that situational factors such as perceived threats to the social order activate latent authoritarianism. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic presents a rare opportunity to test whether existential threat stemming from an indiscriminate virus moderates the relationship between authoritarianism and political attitudes toward the nation and out-groups. Using data from two large nationally representative samples of adults in the United Kingdom (N = 2,025) and Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) collected during the initial phases of strict lockdown measures in both countries, we find that the associations between right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and (1) nationalism and (2) anti-immigrant attitudes are conditional on levels of perceived threat. As anxiety about the COVID-19 pandemic increases, so too does the effect of RWA on those political outcomes. Thus, it appears that existential threats to humanity from the COVID-19 pandemic moderate expressions of authoritarianism in society. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article examines the role of party system polarization in shaping immigrants’ party loyalties in their host country. It suggests that foreign-born individuals are more likely to become partisans when political parties take more distinct policy positions on immigration control. Moreover, this relationship is more pronounced among foreign-born non-citizens than foreign-born citizens. Using individual-level public opinion data from eight rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS), 2002–2017, and measures of party system polarization constructed using party policy positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) in 17 West European democracies, the analyses confirm these expectations. The findings presented here suggest that party polarization on immigration control enhances, rather than undermines, immigrant political integration in contemporary democracies. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Given the limitations in existing resident attitude research, a new concept of resident sentiment is proposed to describe local residents’ overall perceptions of and emotional dispositions toward a dominant tourist market, in which attitude is a constituent part and behavioral response is implied. To operationalize this higher-order latent concept, this study developed measurements for its five components (cognitive and affective attitudes, identification, and two collective mentalities) identified from an earlier exploratory study. An online survey received 1,000 usable responses from Hong Kong residents to validate this construct in a nomological network. The results not only indicate the reliability and validity of the refined scales, but also provide support for resident sentiment as a better indicator of residents’ behavioral responses than attitude. Resident sentiment has the potential for significant use in extending resident attitude studies by academics, as well as being a performance measure for practitioners seeking destination sustainability. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - How do people react to foreign actors’ involvement in a conflict in a third party? Many studies have explored how individuals react to their country’s foreign policy choices, as well as how they react to the policies targeting their countries. Yet, we know less about how they form their attitudes regarding the policies not directly aiming at their own countries, and hence, their well-being. Building on intergroup relations and employing a social psychological approach, this article argues that identity serves as a heuristic through which individuals evaluate foreign actors, and their policies targeting in- and out-group members living abroad. Conducting a survey experiment in Turkey, I test my claims in the context of the Syrian Civil War. The findings of the experiments reveal that transnational identity ties have an impact on attitude formation: Turks and Kurds express positive/negative attitudes towards the USA and Russia conditional on whether their involvement to the conflict favor/disfavor their in-group/out-group across the border. Broadly speaking, the results show that domestic cleavages are of importance in predicting the public’s reaction to the developments in international politics, which implies a necessity of taking domestic politics in designing soft power promotion and public diplomacy strategies for many global and regional powers in attempting to win hearts and minds abroad. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Peer group effects of relational victimization and empowerment among high school instrumental music students were examined using a cross-sectional design. We evaluated the homophily hypothesis that states peer group membership influences individual-level relational aggression and feelings of empowerment. Peer groups were identified using social network analysis, suggesting that participation in marching band significantly impacts feelings of empowerment reducing self-reported relational victimization, even after controlling for gender, caring behaviors, and positive attitudes toward bullying. The impact of peer group membership suggests that future studies consider peer relations across whole school populations and subtypes of aggression. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Various diversity ideologies including assimilation, colorblindness, and multiculturalism have been promoted with mixed results about their costs and benefits. In the current research, we consider the impact of a new diversity ideology, interculturalism, discussed and debated by political philosophers and policy-makers as the “way forward.” Across three experiments (N = 1230) in two ethnically diverse nations, we examined the causal impact of promoting interculturalism on intergroup relations. Data revealed that interculturalism reduced outgroup prejudice, increased willingness to engage in intergroup contact, improved implicit attitudes, and increased behavioral trust and cooperation relative to controls. Reductions in essentialist beliefs partially mediated the impact of interculturalism, highlighting one psychological mechanism underlying the benefits of interculturalism. However, interculturalism was found to be no better than multiculturalism in its impact on intergroup relations in two of three experiments. Collectively, these studies suggest that interculturalism may be a promising new diversity strategy for improving intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - What types of fears does immigration trigger in individuals and how do these fears differ across partisan lines? Prior research explores this question indirectly by linking immigration attitudes to respondents’ demographics or to different threat frames. This research note offers a more direct test by designing a randomized experiment on a nationally representative sample of US citizens. I provide one half of the respondents with neutral information about immigration, while the other half serves as the control group. I find that respondents for whom the immigration issue is made salient (i.e. the treatment group) are more fearful of both their personal as well as national economic situation and about crime in their community than respondents in the control group. I further find that the overall effects are mainly driven by those respondents who self-identify as Republicans. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - More research than ever before uses public opinion data to investigate society and politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Ethnic identities are widely theorized to mediate many of the political attitudes and behaviors that MENA surveys commonly seek to measure, but, to date, no research has systematically investigated how the observable ethnic category(s) of the interviewer may influence participation and answers given in Middle East surveys. Here we measure the impact of one highly salient and outwardly observable ascriptive attribute of interviewers—nationality—using data from an original survey experiment conducted in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar. Applying the total survey error (TSE) framework and utilizing an innovative nonparametric matching technique, we estimate treatment effects on both nonresponse error and measurement error. We find that Qatari nationals are more likely to begin and finish a survey, and respond to questions, when interviewed by a fellow national. Qataris also edit their answers to sensitive questions relating to the unequal status of citizens and noncitizens, reporting views that are more exclusionary and less positive toward out-group members, when the interviewer is a conational. The findings have direct implications for consumers and producers of a growing number of surveys conducted inside and outside the Arab world, where migration and conflict have made respondent-interviewer mismatches along national and other ethnic dimensions more salient and more common. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Rabies is a deadly zoonotic disease responsible for almost 60,000 deaths each year, especially in Africa and Asia including Thailand. Dogs are the major reservoirs for rabies virus in these settings. This study thus used the concept of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) to identify socioeconomic factors that contribute to the differences in the canine rabies occurrences in high and low-risk areas which were classified by a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Multistage sampling was then applied to designate the study locations and a KAP-based questionnaire was used to retrieve data and relevant perspectives from the respondents. Based on the responses from 476 participants living across four regions of Thailand, we found that the knowledge of the participants was positively correlated with their behaviors but negatively associated with the attitudes. Participants who are male, younger, educated at the level of middle to high school, or raising more dogs are likely to have negative attitudes but good knowledge on rabies prevention and control whereas farmers with lower income had better attitudes regardless of their knowledge. We found that people in a lower socioeconomic status with a lack of knowledge are not willing to pay at a higher vaccine price. Public education is a key to change dog owners' behaviors. Related authorities should constantly educate people on how to prevent and control rabies in their communities. Our findings should be applicable to other countries with similar socioeconomic statuses. © Copyright © 2021 Premashthira, Suwanpakdee, Thanapongtharm, Sagarasaeranee, Thichumpa, Sararat and Wiratsudakul.

AB  - The link between integration policies and intergroup attitudes or threat perceptions has received considerable attention. However, no studies so far have been able to explore how this relationship changed following the European migration crisis due to a lack of recent comparative policy data. Using new MIPEX data, this is the first study to examine mechanisms underlying the policy-threat nexus following the European migration crisis, distinguishing between several strands of integration policies, and realistic and symbolic threat. To do so, we combine 2017 Eurobarometer data with 2017 Migrant Integration Policy data, resulting in a sample of 28,080 respondents nested in 28 countries. The analyses also control for economic conditions, outgroup size, and media freedom. Multilevel analyses indicate that respondents living in countries with more inclusive integration policies in general report lower realistic and symbolic threat. When investigating different policy strands, we find that inclusive policies regarding political participation and access to nationality for immigrants are associated with lower realistic and symbolic threat. We compare our findings to those from prior to the European migration crisis and discuss the potential role of this crisis in the policy-threat nexus. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - COVID-19 caused a significant public health crisis worldwide and triggered some other issues such as economic crisis, job cuts, mental anxiety, etc. This pandemic plies across the world and involves many people not only through the infection but also agitation, stress, fret, fear, repugnance, and poignancy. During this time, social media involvement and interaction increase dynamically and share one's viewpoint and aspects under those mentioned health crises. From user-generated content on social media, we can analyze the public's thoughts and sentiments on health status, concerns, panic, and awareness related to COVID-19, which can ultimately assist in developing health intervention strategies and design effective campaigns based on public perceptions. In this work, we scrutinize the users' sentiment in different time intervals to assist in trending topics in Twitter on the COVID-19 tweets dataset. We also find out the sentimental clusters from the sentiment categories. With the help of comprehensive sentiment dynamics, we investigate different experimental results that exhibit different multifariousness in social media engagement and communication in the pandemic period. © 2021 Ahmed et al.

AB  - Given the high density of urban spaces, residents and tourists share resources and infrastructure in limited spaces. The purpose of the study is to investigate the influence of residents’ perceived tourism impacts on their attitudes towards tourism growth, the effect of proximity to tourism center on residents’ attitudes, and how this effect is moderated by residents’ demographic features (age, gender, length of residence) in urban settings. A total of 251 responses were collected in downtown Greenville, a tourist zone located in the heart of Greenville, SC, USA. Using multiple regression models and ANOVA, the study suggested that (1) economic impact was the most important predictor of residents’ attitudes towards tourism growth, (2) downtown residents were more favorable of tourism growth than county residents, and (3) Age and gender moderated the effect of proximity to a tourism center on residents’ attitudes towards tourism growth. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Many of the world's refugees remain in Africa, where they stay long-term, mainly in neighboring countries. The present directions point to integration, in which the host society and the political surroundings play a key role. This paper aims to investigate the ways in which public opinion towards and contact with refugees support integration processes. We apply this research to a settlement setting in rural Zambia, a recent dataset of 275 households from 2018, and an econometric analysis. This is the first study dealing with a set of factors that affect the hosts’ opinion towards and contact with refugees in an African settlement context, and with respect to the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework produced by the United Nations. Our results show, particularly, the religiosity, group membership, life satisfaction, food insecurity, agricultural ownership and natural resource uses of the host society to be the main factors that need policy consideration for the promotion of refugee integration. Stakeholders dealing in host–refugee settings and seeking for durable solutions should roll out community programs to address threat perceptions and interaction improvements. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The present research examined the degree to which symbolic and realistic threat perceptions of documented and undocumented Mexican immigrants predicted support for willingness to provide basic resources (e.g., food, water) in detention centers and agreement with policies that restrict Mexican immigration through detention and deportation. Our study recruited 191 participants online via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results showed that undocumented immigrants were more realistically, but not symbolically threatening than their documented counterparts. Intergroup threat predicted lower willingness to provide basic resources in detention centers and greater support of punitive policies. This finding was not moderated by whether participants evaluated documented or undocumented immigrants. Once we accounted for social dominance orientation (SDO), political attitudes, and contact with Mexican immigrants, only SDO remained a significant predictor of attitudes toward resources in detention centers, while all variables predicted more support for punitive policies. These findings highlight the roles of symbolic and realistic threats, SDO, political attitudes, and intergroup contact in endorsing punitive immigration policies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - While some scholars suggest that critical attitudes towards inequality follow the class gradient during recessions, others find that classes are largely unresponsive. In this article, I consider how party affiliation interacts with class to shape perceptions of inequality during a recession. I argue that it is important to look at the interplay between class and partisanship to better understand individual views towards inequality during times of economic crises. Leveraging data from the International Social Survey Programme before and after The Great Recession, I find that the recession did not raise awareness of inequality across classes. This is because party affiliation moderates the relationship differently according to class. Specifically, party affiliation is more important in shaping the inequality views for the upper class and less so for the working class. Future research needs to consider the interplay between class and politics when exploring how inequality attitudes respond to economic crises. © 2021 Canadian Sociological Association/La Société canadienne de sociologie

AB  - The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) framework has contributed to advances in developmental science by examining the interdependent and cumulative nature of adverse childhood environmental exposures on life trajectories. Missing from the ACEs framework, however, is the role of pervasive and systematic oppression that afflicts certain racialized groups and that leads to persistent threat and deprivation. In the case of children from immigrant parents, the consequence of a limited ACEs framework is that clinicians and researchers fail to address the psychological violence inflicted on children from increasingly restrictive immigration policies, ramped up immigration enforcement, and national anti-immigration rhetoric. Drawing on the literature with Latinx children, the objective of this conceptual article is to integrate the ecological model with the dimensional model of childhood adversity and psychopathology to highlight how direct experience of detention and deportation, threat of detention and deportation, and exposure to systemic marginalization and deprivation are adverse experiences for many Latinx children in immigrant families. This article highlights that to reduce bias and improve developmental science and practice with immigrants and with U.S.-born children of immigrants, there must be an inclusion of immigration-related threat and deprivation into the ACEs framework. We conclude with a practical and ethical discussion of screening and assessing ACEs in clinical and research settings, using an expanded ecological framework that includes immigration-related threat and deprivation. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Previous research suggests that listening to music can enhance memory and well-being. However, what is often missing from this analysis is consideration of the social dimensions of music—for example, its capacity to affirm or threaten listeners’ social identities. This study examined whether (ir)religious music that was potentially identity-affirming or identity-threatening (Christian hymns, Buddhist chants, classical, or no music) would affect Christians’ and Atheists’ (N = 267) well-being and memory performance while listening. Analyses revealed significant interactions between (ir)religious group and music type on memory, self-esteem, and mood. Listening to music that potentially threatened one's religious identity appeared to undermine both performance self-esteem and actual memory performance, while increasing feelings of hostility. This pattern was found for Christians (vs. Atheists) who listened to Buddhist chants. Conversely, Atheists’ performance self-esteem (and to some degree their memory performance) was lowest, and their hostility highest, when they listened to Christian hymns. In this way, listening to music that potentially threatened one's religious group identity (or lack thereof) appeared to be detrimental for memory, self-esteem, and mood. These results bridge research on the psychology of religion, music psychology, and social identity theorizing by demonstrating that the effects of music on memory and well-being may reflect important (even sacred) social identities, with potential implications for individual well-being and intergroup relations. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti-immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti-immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti-immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti-immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti-immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Children tend to assume that their ingroup members are more likely to share their preferences than outgroup members, but group membership and shared preferences need not be congruent in reality. The current study investigated 76 3- to 6-year-old children's baseline intergroup attitudes in a minimal group context and their subsequent attitudes after being informed that either (a) their ingroup, but not their outgroup, shared their preferences or (b) their outgroup, but not their ingroup, shared their preferences. Cues about shared preferences affected children's intergroup biases to some extent, such that children tended to like their outgroup more and to allocate resources fairly among their ingroup and outgroup when they learned that their outgroup shared their preferences. However, intergroup biases were robust in some measures, such that children reported high ingroup liking and demonstrated ingroup favoritism in behavioral attribution regardless of whether they learned that their ingroup or outgroup shared their preferences. Children were also administered measures tapping into cognitive flexibility, but there was no coherent evidence that children's cognitive flexibility was related to their initial intergroup attitudes or their subsequent intergroup attitudes after learning that their ingroup or outgroup shared their preferences. The current study demonstrates a nuanced picture of intergroup biases, such that these biases might not be entirely entrenched but can nonetheless be robust in the face of conflicting cues about group membership and shared preferences. Furthermore, the importance of investigating intergroup biases at the individual level, rather than only at the group level, is discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We sought to examine support for gun polices by race and ethnicity, and among gun owning subgroups. We combined two waves of the National Survey of Gun Policy (January 2017 and 2019 [N = 3804]). We used chi-square tests to assess whether support for gun policies differed by race or ethnicity overall and among subgroups of gun owners. Most U.S. adults supported 17 of 21 gun-related policies. Among gun owners, Blacks supported six policies at higher levels than whites, including minimum age requirements for gun ownership and assault weapon and ammunition-related restrictions. Hispanic gun owners supported safe storage requirements at higher levels than white gun owners. While support differed by race and ethnicity for some policies, majorities of U.S. adults supported nearly all gun policies examine regardless of race. One notable exception, carrying a concealed gun on K-12 school grounds did not reach majority support among any subgroup. While tailored messaging may be appropriate in certain circumstances, it is important to highlight the similarities in support for evidence-based gun polices across racial and ethnic groups. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The stressors of immigration detention and negative host country experiences make effective access to health care vital for migrant detainees, but little is known regarding the health experiences of this populations and the barriers to healthcare access. The present research investigates immigration detainees’ experiences of health-related help-seeking in the distressing and stigmatised environment of UK immigration removal centres (IRCs), as well as staff members’ experiences of providing help. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 detainees and 21 staff and analysed using theoretical thematic analysis guided by the social identity approach. The findings indicate that the practical constraints on help provision (e.g. lack of time and resources, the unpredictable nature of detention) are exacerbated by the complex and conflictual intergroup relationships within which these helping transactions occur. These transactions are negatively affected by stigma, mutual distrust and reputation management concerns, as well as detainees’ feelings of powerlessness and confusion around eligibility to receive health care. Some detainees argued that the help ignores the systematic inequalities associated with their detainee status, thereby making it fundamentally inappropriate and ineffective. The intergroup context (of inequality and illegitimacy) shapes the quality of helping transactions, care experiences and health service engagement in groups experiencing chronic low status, distress and uncertainty. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Transgender and nonbinary (TGNB) people face discrimination based on negative societal attitudes toward TGNB identities. Our study explored factors contributing to negative TGNB attitudes, including participants’ gender, age, religion, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and adherence to traditional gender ideologies. Our sample of 808 U.S. Mechanical Turk participants completed measures of RWA, SDO, traditional masculinity and femininity, and transgender attitudes and beliefs. Because TGNB people have diverse identities, we modified the transgender attitudes and beliefs scale to measure attitudes toward trans man, trans woman, and nonbinary targets instead of the single “transgender” umbrella. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that gender was a significant predictor of attitudes toward trans men and trans women. Higher levels of RWA, traditional masculinity, and anti-egalitarianism (a domain of SDO) predicted negative attitudes toward all TGNB identities, with RWA generally being the strongest predictor. Traditional femininity and the dominance domain of SDO did not significantly contribute to our predictive model for most groups, although we were surprised to find that for nonbinary people, higher levels of traditional femininity predicted positive attitudes. These results can inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing transprejudice. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Authoritarian predispositions and contextual threats are both thought to result in intolerance and prejudice towards immigrants and other minorities. Yet there is considerable dispute as to how authoritarianism and threat interact to produce an “authoritarian dynamic.” Some scholars argue that threats increase intolerance by “galvanizing” authoritarians. Others claim that authoritarians are always intolerant toward outgroups, with threat instead “mobilizing” nonauthoritarians. Using experimental manipulations of immigrant cultural threat embedded in nationally representative samples from 19 European societies, this study offers a test of these competing hypotheses. While we find some evidence for the “galvanizing” hypothesis, we find no evidence for the “mobilizing” hypothesis. The effects vary considerably across national samples however, with immigrants from Muslim societies being particularly likely to activate authoritarian predispositions. These findings show how the migration of culturally distinctive groups has the potential to activate authoritarian dispositions, thereby pushing the issue of immigration to the center of political debates. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Many countries seek to specifically attract talented migrants in order to match the needs of national economies. In addition to the well-known intergroup antagonism between natives and immigrants, such immigration policies targeting talented migrants imply differentiation within the immigrant group, using normative criteria to distinguish desirable and economically useful immigrants from undesirable ones. Based on European Social Survey data (Round 7, N = 9856) comprised of national citizens from six multinational countries, we show that national majorities support individualized, “cherry picking” immigration policies to a greater degree than historical national minorities and that this support is associated with national majorities' stronger sense of identification with the country and its individualistic norms. We thereby conceptualize a novel facet of multiculturalism based on individual justice principles that is rarely at the forefront of research on immigration and multiculturalism. © 2020 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - This exploratory study sought to test the relationship among race, self-rated health (SRH), and colorblindness, conceptualized as the belief that race/ethnicity should not and does not matter. Independently, SRH, a multidimensional concept entailing physical and psychological health and one’s affiliation in an ethnic/racial group, may contribute to racial attitudes. However, little is known about how SRH and racial/ethnic identity in combination may affect colorblind racial attitudes. It was thus hypothesized that SRH would moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity and colorblind racial attitudes. The research sample consisted of 136 autochthonous adults and “individuals with migration backgrounds” residing in Bavaria (Germany), who were divided by self-identified race (whites, n = 85; non-whites, n = 51). The results show that SRH moderates the relationship between race and racial colorblindness. More specifically, it was found that the greater the SRH of the white participants, the less they embraced a colorblind ideology. Conversely, the greater the SRH of the non-white participants, the greater their colorblind racial attitudes. These results suggest that stronger SRH may reduce colorblindness among whites and intensify it among non-whites. The implications of the obtained results may be useful in addressing how surmount barriers to data collection, measurements, and research related to racial and ethnic health disparities in “colorblind” Germany may contribute to health inequalities. Thus, this paper’s contribution lies in tracking such disparities to aid their reduction or elimination. © 2020, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the connections that the dangerous and competitive social worldviews of Israelis had with their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians. More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with attitudes toward peace may be mediated by the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation as well as the perceived threat from the Palestinians in a large community sample of Israelis (N = 1,236). The results of a serial parallel multiple mediation analysis revealed partial support for our hypotheses. As expected, the association that the dangerous social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians was mediated by right-wing authoritarianism and perceived threat from the Palestinians. However, the association that the competitive social worldview had with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians differed from our expectations. More specifically, the competitive social worldview had a negative indirect association with attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians through both right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation but there was also an unexpected positive indirect association through perceived threat from the Palestinians. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that ideological attitudes and perceived threat may play in the connections between the social worldviews of Israelis and their attitudes toward peace with the Palestinians.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward the nonreligious persist in America. This may compel some nonreligious individuals to conceal their identity to manage feelings of social identity threat. In one correlational study and one experiment, we found evidence of social identity threat and concealment behavior among nonreligious Americans. Our first study showed that Southern nonreligious individuals reported higher levels of stigma consciousness and self-reported concealment of nonreligious identity, which in turn predicted lower likelihood of self-identifying as “atheist” in public settings than in private settings. Our second study successfully manipulated feelings of social identity threat by showing that atheists who read an article about negative stereotypes of their group subsequently exhibited higher concealment scores than did atheists who read one of two control articles. Implications for how nonreligious individuals negotiate social identity threat and future directions for nonreligion research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Romantic jealousy, a complex response to a real or perceived threat to a romantic relationship, can have serious negative consequences for individuals, partners and perceived rivals. The likelihood of a jealous response is heightened among individuals who experience attachment anxiety, and online communication and social media provide unique fodder for romantic jealousy. The purpose of the current study is to test whether the association between attachment anxiety and online jealousy (jealous response to ambiguous hypothetical online scenarios) is moderated by negative attitudes about online communication. Individuals in dating relationships were asked about attachment anxiety and attitudes about online communication (i.e., apprehension and concern about misunderstandings) as well as emotional, cognitive, and behavioral online jealousy. Hierarchical linear regression revealed an attachment anxiety-attitude interaction, such that the link between attachment anxiety and jealousy was stronger for participants with relatively low levels of negative attitudes about online communication compared to participants with relatively high levels of negative attitudes. The current study expands knowledge about attachment anxiety and jealousy in the context of online communication and social media, and highlights the importance of considering attitudes about online communication when studying relationship processes in the digital arena. © Copyright © 2021 Sullivan.

AB  - Importance: Policies to promote social distancing can minimize COVID-19 transmission but come with substantial social and economic costs. Quantifying relative preferences among the public for such practices can inform locally relevant policy prioritization and optimize uptake. Objective: To evaluate relative utilities (ie, preferences) for COVID-19 pandemic social distancing strategies against the hypothetical risk of acquiring COVID-19 and anticipated income loss. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study recruited individuals living in the Missouri area from May to June 2020 via randomly distributed unincentivized social media advertisements and local recruitment platforms for members of minority racial and ethnic groups. Participants answered 6 questions that asked them to choose between 2 hypothetical counties where business closures, social distancing policy duration, COVID-19 infection risk, and income loss varied. Main Outcomes and Measures: Reweighted population-level relative preferences (utilities) for social distancing policies, subgroups, and latent classes. Results: The survey had a 3% response rate (3045 of 90320). Of the 2428 respondents who completed the survey, 1669 (75%) were 35 years and older, 1536 (69%) were women, and 1973 (89%) were White. After reweighting to match Missouri population demographic characteristics, the strongest preference was for the prohibition of large gatherings (mean preference, -1.43; 95% CI, -1.67 to -1.18), with relative indifference to the closure of social and lifestyle venues (mean preference, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.17). There were weak preferences to keep outdoor venues (mean preference, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.61) and schools (mean preference, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.30) open. Latent class analysis revealed 4 distinct preference phenotypes in the population: risk averse (48.9%), conflicted (22.5%), prosocial (14.9%), and back to normal (13.7%), with men twice as likely as women to belong to the back to normal group than the risk averse group (relative risk ratio, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.12). Conclusions And relevance: In this survey study using a discrete choice experiment, public health policies that prohibited large gatherings, as well as those that closed social and lifestyle venues, appeared to be acceptable to the public. During policy implementation, these activities should be prioritized for first-phase closures. These findings suggest that policy messages that address preference heterogeneity (eg, focusing on specific preference subgroups or targeting men) could improve adherence to social distancing measures for COVID-19 and future pandemics. © 2021 Eshun-Wilson I et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatology is among the least racially/ethnically diverse medical specialties in the US Dermatology Interest Groups (DIGs). DIGs may play a critical role in addressing these disparities by facilitating early exposure and mentorship, both associated with higher rates of medical students pursuing specific fields. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to characterize the activities, goals, and challenges of DIGs in medical schools nationwide. METHODS: A 15-question survey was distributed electronically to 92 DIG leaders enrolled in four-year accredited allopathic/osteopathic medical schools nationwide. Data collected included DIG leaders&rsquo; demographic information, medical training stage, DIG size/age, number/type of DIG activities hosted, presence of faculty/resident mentors, and goals/challenges. RESULTS: There were 48 total and 46 complete responses (52% response rate). Most DIG leaders were female (81%), white (63%), and from allopathic medical schools of roughly equal geographic distribution. Over three-quarters of DIGs had affiliated dermatology departments and residencies. Most had faculty advisors; few had resident mentors. Presence of an affiliated dermatology department was associated with statistically significant increase in mentoring opportunities (P=0.034), significantly increased odds of having dedicated faculty mentors (OR=6.10, 95%CI 1.11&ndash;33.56), and non-significantly increased odds of having dedicated resident mentors (OR=2.96, 95%CI 0.33&ndash;26.79). DIG leaders self-identified early dermatology exposure, aiding in the match, relationship-building, and community engagement as main objectives and mismatches in opportunities, time, funding, and interest as main challenges. CONCLUSIONS: DIGs provide valuable opportunities to medical students exploring the field and may play a role in reducing future dermatology workforce disparities. Dermatology departments, residencies, and medical schools should support their aims and reduce structural barriers to success. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(7):767-770. doi:10.36849/JDD.5732.

AB  - The Chilean health authorities have implemented a sanitary strategy known as dynamic quarantine or strategic quarantine to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. Under this system, lockdowns were established, lifted, or prolonged according to the weekly health authorities' assessment of municipalities' epidemiological situation. The public announcements about the confinement situation of municipalities country-wide are made typically on Tuesdays or Wednesdays before noon, have received extensive media coverage, and generated sharp stock market fluctuations. Municipalities are the smallest administrative division in Chile, with each city broken down typically into several municipalities. We analyze social media behavior in response to the confinement situation of the population at the municipal level. The dynamic quarantine scheme offers a unique opportunity for our analysis, given that municipalities display a high degree of heterogeneity, both in size and in the socioeconomic status of their population. We exploit the variability over time in municipalities' confinement situations, resulting from the dynamic quarantine strategy, and the cross-sectional variability in their socioeconomic characteristics to evaluate the impact of these characteristics on social sentiment. Using event study and panel data methods, we find that proxies for social sentiment based on Twitter queries are negatively related (more pessimistic) to increases in the number of confined people, but with a statistically significant effect concentrated on people from the wealthiest cohorts of the population. For indicators of social sentiment based on Google Trends, we found that search intensity during the periods surrounding government announcements is positively related to increases in the total number of confined people. Still, this effect does not seem to be dependent on the segments of the population affected by the quarantine. Furthermore, we show that the observed heterogeneity in sentiment mirrors heterogeneity in stock market reactions to government announcements. We provide evidence that the observed stock market behavior around quarantine announcements can be explained by the number of people from the wealthiest segments of the population entering or exiting lockdown. © 2021 Díaz, Henríquez.

AB  - Prior empirical research on the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and meritocratic attitudes has yielded inconsistent findings. This study contributes to the existing literature by examining the heterogeneous relationship between SES and meritocratic beliefs and perceptions across community socioeconomic contexts in China. Using nationally representative data from the China Family Panel Studies, the results show that individual SES is positively related to support for meritocratic beliefs, but negatively associated with perceptions of meritocracy. Moreover, SES disparities in meritocratic beliefs are more salient in socioeconomically disadvantaged and unequal communities, where residents with relatively higher SES are more likely to hold meritocratic beliefs. In contrast, SES gaps in meritocratic perceptions are more significant in socioeconomically advantaged and homogeneous communities, where individuals with relatively lower SES are more likely to perceive the allocation of resources as meritocratic. These findings provide theoretical insights for understanding how self-interest and system justification theories may jointly explain social origin disparities in public attitudes about meritocracy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Apology diplomacy promises to assuage historical grievances held by foreign publics, yet in practice appears to ignite domestic backlash, raising questions about its efficacy. This article develops a theory of how political apologies affect public approval of an apologizing government across domestic and foreign contexts. The authors test its implications using large-scale survey experiments in Japan and the United States. In the surveys, the authors present vignettes about World War II grievances and randomize the nature of a government apology. They find that apology-making, both as statements acknowledging wrongdoing and as expressions of remorse, boosts approval in the recipient state. But in the apologizing state, backlash is likely among individuals with strong hierarchical group dispositions-manifested as nationalism, social-dominance orientation, and conservatism-and among those who do not consider the recipient a strategically important partner. This microlevel evidence reveals how leaders face a crucial trade-off between improving support abroad and risking backlash at home, with implications for the study of diplomatic communication and transitional justice.

AB  - Local politicians can play an important role in promoting citizenship, but their helpfulness varies considerably across local councils. Do politicians discriminate against immigrants seeking to naturalize in ways that public opinion and national citizenship debates would suggest? In two correspondence studies fielded in Germany, we find no evidence that features that are salient in national debates and public opinion predict responsiveness. Specifically, signals of national identification and attachment play no role. Instead, we document a reversed national penalty: politicians are 50% more likely to assist a large low-status group (Turks) than a small high status-group (Canadians). When probing mechanisms via elite interviews, we find that the desire to promote integration and electoral participation can counteract biases that typically generate discrimination. Among politicians, factors associated with group size can therefore help reverse penalties against low-status groups. Research on citizenship and discrimination must consider these disconnects between public perceptions, national debates, and local politics. © 2021 by the Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - Help offered by a member of a high status group to a member of a low status group is often resented because it may be perceived as motivated by a desire to reinforce status relations between the groups. The present research explored how trust in a high status group by members of a low status group can ameliorate these negative consequences. Study 1 examined how the trust of Israeli-Jews among Israeli-Arabs relates to their reactions to an offer of help from an Israeli-Jew. Additional studies investigated the reactions of low-status group members to help from a member of the high status group in a minimal group context (Study 2) and a real group setting (Study 3) while manipulating trust in the outgroup. The findings of the three experiments indicate that greater trust in the high status group elicited distinctively more positive intergroup responses to an offer of help from the high status group. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Should governments increase their efforts in R&D public funding during recession periods? The objective of the present study is to compare the effect of public aid to business R&D on technological inputs and outputs through the economic cycle. We contribute to this literature by examining the effect of one specific instrument of direct public support: selective loans for firms’ R&D projects. For the analysis, we consider Spanish firms supported through this kind of instrument for the periods 2002–2005 and 2010–2012. Our results suggest that the hypothesis of full crowding out of private R&D is rejected in both cycle periods, expansion and recession: public support has positive effects on the resources devoted to R&D activities. However, the effect of public support on some technological outputs depends on the cycle phase: firms supported by selective loans during the crisis are more likely to obtain product innovations. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Aim: Kingdon [(2014) Agendas, Alternatives, and Public Policies. Essex. United Kingdom: Pearson Education Limited] argues that windows of opportunity to pass policies emerge when problems, solutions and policy support co-occur. This study aims to identify a set of alcohol policies with the potential to reduce alcohol-related disparities given high levels of support from marginalized groups, such as racial/ethnic minorities and lower-income groups. Methods: This study used data from five US National Alcohol Surveys, which were based on household probability samples of adults in 1995 (n = 4243), 2000 (n = 5736), 2005 (n = 1445), 2010 (n = 4164) and 2015 (n = 4041). We used multiple logistic regression to determine the odds of policy support by racial/ethnic group and income level, considering price, place and marketing policies as well as individual-level interventions. Results: Overall a majority of Americans supported banning alcohol sales in corner stores (59.4%), banning alcohol advertisements on television (55.5%), and establishing universal health coverage for alcohol treatment (80.0%). Support was particularly high among Blacks, Hispanics/Latinos and lower-income persons. Multivariate models showed that compared with White people, foreign-born Hispanics/Latinos had the most robust levels of support, including raising alcohol taxes (aOR = 2.40, 95% CI: 2.00, 2.88, P < 0.0001), banning alcohol sales in corner stores (aOR = 2.85, 95% CI: 2.22, 3.65, P < 0.0001) and reducing retail sales hours (aOR = 2.91, 95% CI: 2.38, 3.55, P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Of the policies examined, banning alcohol sales at corner stores is most likely to be in a "window of opportunity"for reducing alcohol-related disparities. By simultaneously reducing population-level consumption and harms from others' drinking, place-based policies have the potential to reduce harms experienced by marginalized groups. © 2021 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Approximately 52% of young women report receiving threatening messages, sharing of their private photos by others without their consent, or sexual harassment online – examples of cyber-aggression towards women. A scale to measure endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women was developed to be inclusive of the many contemporary ways that women are targeted online. We examined sociopolitical ideologies (right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation) and perceived threats (based on the Dual Process Motivational Model of Ideology and Prejudice, as well as Integrated Threat Theory) as predictors of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women in three studies (Pilot Study, n = 46; Study 1, n = 276; Study 2, n = 6381). Study 1 and 2 participants were recruited from online video gaming communities; Study 2 comprised responses collected during or after a livestream of YouTubers doing the survey went viral. The YouTubers criticized feminism and alleged that female gamers had privilege in the gaming community. In all three studies, exploratory factor analyses suggested endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women is a unidimensional psychological construct and the scale demonstrated great internal reliability. In path analyses, social dominance orientation emerged as the most consistent predictor of endorsement of cyber-aggression towards women, mediated, in part, by perceived threats. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims to determine the process through which social dominance orientation (SDO) tends to increase positive attitudes towards physical wife abuse among men. 211 adult men (aged between 18 and 65 years; Mage = 28.91; SD = 10.50) with different levels of education and various professions (e.g., students, teachers, engineers, doctors, workers, police officers) participated in the study. Measures of attitudes towards physical wife abuse and participants' levels of SDO, justifications and ambivalent sexism were assessed. Results revealed that, when controlled for age, education and economic level, SDO predicted positive attitudes towards physical wife abuse via both hostile sexism and justifications of physical wife abuse. That is, men who desire male dominance over women support sexist practices by accepting legitimizing myths that justify the inequality and hierarchy. Implications are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In 2015, United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Implementing SDGs is an important issue for companies as well as for nations. However, to consistently monitor and evaluate progress towards these goals, major efforts in developing objective indices for measuring the levels of SDGs are essential. Currently almost all SDG studies uniformly use available country-level official statistics to synthesize an SDG index, failing to reflect the feelings and opinions of the general public. In this paper we introduce an SDG Social Index developed by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm. By using social media text data rather than conventional survey data, this index can measure and evaluate the outspoken feelings and opinions of the public toward the SDGs. Here we produce an SDG Social Index for a global company and statistically assess its effectiveness. This framework for producing an SDG Social Index can easily be extended to make other indices where various text data are available. It can also be easily extended to yield country-specific SDG indices across nations. In Conclusion section we summarize the implications of our approach and discuss limitations and future research areas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Intergroup conflict and bias often occur between subgroups nested within a superordinate group. In these situations, the leader of the superordinate group plays a key role, as an intergroup leader, in reducing conflict. To be effective, an intergroup leader should avoid (1) threatening the subgroups' distinctive identities, and (2) being viewed by one or both groups as ‘one of them’ rather than ‘one of us’. Intergroup leadership theory (Acad Manag Rev, 37, 2012a, 232) posits intergroup leaders can improve subgroup relations by promoting an intergroup relational identity. Two studies (Ns = 178 and 223) tested whether an out-subgroup or in-subgroup leader could improve intergroup attitudes, even among strong subgroup identifiers, by promoting either an intergroup relational identity or a collective identity. We hypothesized an interaction of these variables demonstrating the effectiveness of an intergroup relational identity message for an out-subgroup leader in lessening ingroup bias, especially among strong subgroup identification. Our results, and a meta-analytic summary across both studies (N = 401), supported our hypothesis and intergroup leadership theory, demonstrating an intergroup relational identity is an effective strategy for improving intergroup relations. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The unit of analysis in almost all large-N studies on conflict contagion and diffusion is collective actors, such as states and ethnic groups or movements. Thus, contagion dynamics and processes at the individual level have been neglected. Using original data derived from a public opinion survey, this study examines the micro-level dynamics of contagion in the context of Turkey’s Kurdish conflict. The study suggests that transnational ethnic ties, and in particular, cross-border familial bonds and interactions, facilitate conflict contagion through several strategic and ideational mechanisms. First, transborder familial ties and interactions amplify the demonstration effect of ethnic-kin achievements in contiguous conflict countries. Second, cross-border familial bonds facilitate collaboration between cross-border co-ethnics. Finally, such ties to conflict zones with ethnic kin groups empower pan-ethnic identities. The empirical findings show that Kurds living in Turkey who have close relatives in nearby countries hosting conflicting ethnic-kin groups (i.e. Syria, Iraq, and Iran) have stronger ethnonationalist orientations and claims against the center. However, having close relatives elsewhere (e.g. Europe) does not generate the same impact. The Kurdish case evidences that contagion processes and dynamics might vary substantially across the members of a particular ethnic group. Hence, it is necessary to broaden the conventional focus on collective actors in conflict contagion research and pay greater attention to micro-level variables and factors. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: While the majority of research assesses the impact of end-of-life dreams and visions (ELDVs) on patients, more recent research has begun to explore their impact on family caregivers (FCG). Objective: This study evaluates the relationship between general attitudes about dreams, perspectives of ELDV and their role the bereaved FCG experience. Design: Mixed-methods using a cross-sectional survey and five focus groups. Settings/Subjects: A total of 500 FCGs of patients who died under hospice care were recruited for the survey. Focus group members were self-selected through identified interest from the survey. Measurements: In addition to demographics and ELDV prevalence, general attitude toward dreams, ELDV perspectives, and impact on grief were assessed using ad hoc surveys. Results: Participants reporting ELDVs were significantly more validating of everyday dreams (p <.001). Positive attitudes toward dreams strongly correlated with comfort from ELDVs for both patients and FCGs. Openness correlated positively with comfort from the ELDV for both the patient (r =.149, p =.038) and FCG (r =.217, p = 0.002) and negatively with fear/anxiety (r = −.141, p = 0.050). Negative ELDV perceptions (ex. ELDVs were caused by medications) affected grief in areas such as accepting the loss (r = −.235, p =.010) or maintaining connection (r = −.255, p =.010) with the deceased. Focus group discussions were thematically analyzed resulting in 4 themes: ELDV narrative, Connection, Reflection, and Other Experiences. Conclusions: Positive general attitudes toward dreams and positive ELDV perceptions are correlated with better bereavement outcomes. Therefore, patient and family education on ELDVs that focuses on awareness and understanding of ELDVs may enhance clinical outcomes for both family and patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Amid protracted conflict, children are raised in divided contexts that shape the development of their intergroup attitudes and behaviors. Social identity development theory (SIDT) suggests that in-group preference may contribute to more negative out-group attitudes and behaviors in middle childhood. In such contexts, in-group favoritism may shape resource distribution, a key indicator of prosocial behavior. This study examined the predictors of resource distribution among 387 children (age: M = 9.59, SD = 2.34) of majority (Jewish) and minority (Arab-Muslim) groups in Israel. Rooted in SIDT, a multiple-group chain mediation found that the effect of age on out-group prosocial giving was serially mediated by the child’s in-group symbol preference and negative out-group attitudes. The mediation held across both majority and minority groups, highlighting the underlying developmental process of prosocial giving across group lines in a divided society. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Corporate taxation has historically relied on two views of taxation: the entity view and the aggregative view. The entity view emphasizes that the corporation as a separate entity should pay taxes. The aggregative view instead views the corporation as a conduit for its shareholders and focuses on payments by the shareholders. The public may hold either view or a mixture of views—these perceptions are likely to influence the design of tax policy. One way to distinguish between them is to explore the causal relation between attitudes toward tax avoidance by the wealthy and corporations. For example, suppose in the data that perceptions of the tax avoidance of the wealthy and of corporations are correlated, but that changes in the perceptions about corporate tax avoidance do not cause changes in the perception of tax avoidance by the wealthy. This would provide evidence for an entity view of taxation, because new evidence of corporate tax avoidance would not cause any change in perceptions of avoidance by the wealthy, who are the owners of the corporation. The public would thus not connect avoidance by corporations to their owners. On the other hand, if changes in the perceptions about corporate tax avoidance cause changes in the perception of tax avoidance by the wealthy, this would provide evidence for an aggregate view. In this case, new evidence of corporate avoidance would be reflected in the perceptions of avoidance of shareholders of the corporation. We use data on public perceptions of whether corporation and the wealthy are paying their fair share from the Pew Research Center to explore this issue. Using graph-theoretic methods for determining causal structures within recursive systems, we provide evidence that public attitudes against tax avoidance by the wealthy cause public attitudes toward corporate tax avoidance, but not vice versa. These statistical results provide evidence for the entity view of corporate taxation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article examines the theoretical connections between identity and linked fate, extending the latter concept across three countries and four types of (potential) identity groups. This belief, that what happens to one's ethnic group, religious group, region, or class shapes one's own life chances, is an understudied middle ground between ideational and material drivers of political attitudes. The study uses experimental and observational analyses to show that the strength of individuals' beliefs in linked fate and that belief's consequences vary in systematic and predictable ways. From the very material effect of labor market uncertainty to the highly ideational effect of regional identity, linked fate is a cognitive bridge between two very different kinds of social-psychological experiences that can (and should) be applied across a wide range of countries and groups.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to analyse the effect of perceived intergroup competition on majority adolescents’ behavioural intentions toward two relevant immigrant groups in the Spanish context, Ecuadorians and Moroccans. We proposed an integrative path model in which perceived intergroup competition led to perception of outgroup threat, which in turn affected warmth stereotypes (morality and sociability). Perceived warmth further fostered positive and negative emotions, which in turn predicted facilitative and harmful interpersonal behavioural tendencies. Following a between subject design, participants (N = 231, Mage = 15.39, SD = 1.09) evaluated Moroccans (n = 114) or Ecuadorians (n = 117) on the examined variables. Results indicate that Ecuadorians were perceived as more moral and sociable and elicited less negative emotions than Moroccans. The model had a good fit for both groups. Perceived intergroup competition predicted perceived outgroup threat which, in turn, fostered perceived morality and sociability. Only perceived morality predicted both positive and negative emotions, whereas sociability elicited only positive emotions. Finally, facilitation intentions were predicted by both positive and negative emotions, while harm intentions were triggered only by negative ones. Results highlight the distinctive role of morality for intergroup relations during adolescence and extend previous literature regarding perceived intergroup competition, stereotype content, emotions and perceived outgroup threat. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Sexual prejudice refers to negative attitudes towards individuals based on their sexual orientation. Scholars have shown an interest in identifying the factors that may increase the probability of prejudice against sexual minorities. The current study investigates in particular the main and interactive effects of the participants’ social dominance orientation (SDO) and gender role orientation on their attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in a Turkish sample. It examines whether the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes would be stronger among individuals with high adherence to traditional gender roles. A total of 250 heterosexual university students filled out a questionnaire consisting of items designed to measure their SDO, gender role orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The results overall revealed that SDO, femininity (among females) and masculinity (among males) are positively related to prejudiced attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Supporting expectations, SDO and femininity interact in predicting sexual prejudice. However, masculinity does not interact with participants’ SDO. The supplementary analyses also revealed that the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes was stronger among female participants with high femininity scores and among male participants with lower femininity scores. These findings indicate that a general preference for group inequality and endorsement of traditional gender role predispose individuals to be prejudiced against gay men and lesbians. Thus, the present study supplements the related literature by examining the interactive effects of SDO and gender role orientation in Turkey, a non-Western cultural context. It also provides important implications for researchers and practitioners in terms of developing strategies to reduce prejudice against sexual minorities. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Given rising populist nationalism and multiplying meanings of “right” and “left,” this paper assesses whether Europeans who identify as extremely left-wing on the political spectrum hold anti-immigrant attitudes. In contrast to right-wing xenophobes, we further examine whether the political left, who conventionally emphasize class conflict, oppose immigrants less for cultural reasons and more for materialist reasons. We also consider whether socioeconomic status and values traditionally associated with the political left—favoring redistributive policies, egalitarianism, or social rights to benefits and services for immigrants—temper left- more than right-wing xenophobia. We find that a surprisingly large share of those who identify as far left do express extremely xenophobic attitudes, and we profile them in contrast to far right xenophobes. With logistic regression analysis of nine waves of the European Social Survey (2002–2018), we find that, all things equal, socioeconomic status influences far left xenophobia more than far right xenophobia, but inegalitarian values, less support for redistributive policies, and welfare chauvinism can only partially account for far left xenophobia and unexpectedly do not distinguish it from far right xenophobia. This implies that far left parties might adopt anti-immigrant policies to try to retain their loyal voters, even though such policies do not comport with broader left-wing values and may increase racial and ethnic inequality. Controlling for demographic and attitudinal differences reduces the probability of xenophobia among the far left by about sixty percent, but there remains some residual anti-immigrant attitudes among this group still to be explained. © Copyright © 2021 Kopyciok and Silver.

AB  - Sustainability managers are key stakeholders in implementing and diffusing sustainability initiatives. However, there is a significant gap in the literature examining the impact of greenwashing on sustainability managers. This research examines the effects of greenwashing on sustainability managers’ job satisfaction, commitment, turnover intentions, and job performance from a social identity/person–organization (P–O) fit perspective. Our sample consists of practicing sustainability managers (n = 125) in high-(77%) or mid-level (23%) positions. Results indicate that perceived greenwashing negatively affects the attitudinal outcomes and job performance of sustainability managers. The results also indicate that for sustainability managers whose social responsibility identity is higher than that of their firm, greenwashing has a significant association with lower satisfaction and job performance, and higher intentions to leave. However, for managers whose social responsibility identity is lower than that of their firm, employer greenwashing had no effect on the sustainability managers’ attitudes, even though they recognized their own poor job performance. The cumulative effect may be a situation in which managers in the best position to enhance a firm’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) leave the firm, and vice-versa. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Social Identity Theory (Tajfel; Tajfel and Turner) is rooted in the premise that individuals construct their own identities based on social categorization and group membership, and this attachment of people to groups is sufficient “to produce prejudices both in favor of members of one’s own group and sometimes against members of another group” (Dovidio et al. 4). In this article, I analyze how the characters in “A Private Experience” (2009), by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and “Hora de Partir” (2007), by César Mba A. Abogo, resist group categorization and minimize stereotyping and group distinctions by experiencing intergroup relationships and enhancing their individualities. While the story “A Private Experience” portrays a Muslim and a Christian woman who defy the Muslim-Christian conflict in Nigeria by means of their peaceful and close connection, the interracial couple in “Hora de Partir” challenges racial and social prejudices through their love relationship. Thus, both narratives depict resistant subjects who confront the hegemonic ideologies resulting from group categorizations by the mutual interest between individuals who belong to conflicting groups and the depiction of a fruitful amalgam of transcultural elements within the stories that endorses diversity as a positive social value. By means of establishing harmonious relationships with outgroup members, these literary voices delegitimize intergroup conflict, trigger a transcultural dialogue, and find an effective way to resist the social constraints imposed by group categorization. © 2021, Indiana University.

AB  - Representatives of American progressives and their policy propositions suffered unexpected setbacks in the early stages of the 2020 US presidential election. Unlike progressives during the Progressive Era in the early twentieth century, progressives in the US today have been directly confronted by those they intend to challenge and have failed to win over middle- and lower-class white Americans in inland towns and villages. Despite an enthusiastic response from younger generations and extensive support among the suburban middle class and ethnic minorities, they have been unable to foster synergy due to subtle differences in their reformist agendas. Adverse factors, such as the inherent deficiencies of the American political system in dealing with the challenges of globalization, the fragmentation of public opinion caused by the development of new technologies, and a growing sentiment among Americans to stay out of the trends in world politics, also hinder progressive propositions. Achieving a political revitalization like the one over a hundred years ago will be no easy task. © 2021, The Institute of International and Strategic Studies (IISS), Peking University.

AB  - The silent period is most frequently used to describe the period of second language (L2) acquisition where the learner displays no obvious language output. In Hong Kong, ethnic minority (EM) preschoolers face challenges on home, school and community levels in learning Chinese as a second language, meaning that for those in the silent period, it may particularly difficult to begin speaking Chinese, leading to slower language development. A support service was established, targeting EM preschoolers in Hong Kong who are experiencing the silent period in learning Chinese as a second language. Volunteer teachers conduct individual, one-to-one training with these preschoolers at their homes or at community centers. This study aims to explore the approximate length of the silent period for EM preschoolers in learning Chinese as a second language, comparing the effect of receiving the support as opposed to none, and identify perceived effective practices in the targeted individual support, using a mixed methods approach. Analysis on speaking scores of the Language Progression Framework (LPF) revealed that the average silent period without support lasted for approximately two years, which can be shortened by half a year with the support service. A case study on a preschooler and a semi-structured focus group interview with volunteer teachers revealed perceived effective practices including interesting activities and teaching materials, opportunities for social interaction with peers, establishing rapport between teachers and their preschoolers, and a positive attitude from parents in supporting their children in learning Chinese. Implications for EM preschoolers learning Chinese, integration with the local community, teaching practices and policy making are discussed. © 2021 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - Three studies using pre-existing (Studies 1 and 3) and minimal (Study 2) groups tested the hypothesis that ingroup status shapes whether “conflict’” with an outgroup is strategically acknowledged or downplayed. As predicted, high (vs. low) ingroup status led group members to downplay conflict, but only to an outgroup rather than ingroup audience (Studies 1 and 2; Ns = 127 & 292), and only when the status difference was unstable (vs. stable) and the outgroup's action was perceived as illegitimate (Study 2). High-status group members also collectively communicated with the outgroup in a manner designed to defuse conflict (Study 2). Survey data of industrial (manager–worker) relations further indicated that company managers (high-status) characterized manager–worker relations as less conflictual than did workers (low-status) in the same companies (Study 3; N = 24,661). Findings imply that high-status groups play down conflict as a “benevolent” (but unacknowledged) means of maintaining intergroup status hierarchies. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the tremendous health benefits for both mother and infant, black women (including African Americans and those who self-identify as black) have lower rates of breastfeeding than all other racial groups. Historically, matriarchal role models have been essential within the black family structure. The purpose of this study was to explore matriarchal role models' attitudes and beliefs about breastfeeding. Methods: Thirty-eight black women between the ages of 46-82 years were surveyed regarding their perceptions of breastfeeding. Results: Our results revealed that 44.1% of the participants believed that breastfeeding is a better infant feeding method. However, 52.6% of the participants did not demonstrate confidence in their ability to breastfeed overall. Conclusions: These findings suggest that while black matriarchal role models have positive attitudes about breastfeeding behaviors, they may need to be educated along with postpartum and/or prenatal women about breastfeeding benefits and techniques to better support and improve black women's initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging and the vaccination program still rolling out, there continues to be an immediate need for public health officials to better understand the mechanisms behind the deep and perpetual divide over face masks in America. Using a random sample of Americans (N = 615), following a pre-registered experimental design and analysis plan, we first demonstrated that mask wearers were not innately more cooperative as individuals than non-mask wearers in the Prisoners’ Dilemma (PD) game when information about their own and the other person’s mask usage was not salient. However, we found strong evidence of in-group favouritism among both mask and non-mask wearers when information about the other partner’s mask usage was known. Non-mask wearers were 23 percentage points less likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a mask-wearing partner, and 26 percentage points more likely to cooperate than mask wearers when facing a non-mask-wearing partner. Our analysis suggests social identity effects as the primary reason behind people’s decision whether to wear face masks during the pandemic. Copyright: © 2021 Powdthavee et al.

AB  - Serious concerns about public distrust of scientific experts and the spread of misinformation are growing in the US and elsewhere. To gauge ideological and psychological variability in attitudes toward science, we conducted an extensive analysis of public opinion data based on a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 1,500) and a large replication sample (N = 2,119). We estimated the unique effects of partisanship, symbolic and operational forms of political ideology, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and general system justification (GSJ), after adjusting for demographic factors. Multiverse analyses revealed that (a) conservatism and SDO were significant predictors of distrust of climate science in > 99.9% of model specifications, with conservatism accounting for 80% of the total variance; (b) conservatism, RWA, religiosity, (male) sex, (low) education, (low) income, and distrust of climate science were significant predictors of skepticism about science in general (vs. faith) in > 99.9% of model specifications; (c) conservatism, RWA, (low) education, and distrust of climate science were significant predictors of trust in ordinary people (over scientific experts) > 99.9% of the time; and (d) GSJ was a significant predictor of trust in scientific experts (over ordinary people) 81% of the time, after adjusting for all other demographic and ideological factors. Implications for the role of science in democratic society are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - While men and women make up a similar number of COVID-19 cases, and are equally likely to know someone who has become ill due to the virus, the gendered and systemic implications of immigration during public health emergencies among minority groups in the United States are empirically underexplored. Using the SOMOS COVID-19 Crisis National Latino Survey, we conduct a series of intersectional analyses to understand the extent to which personal experiences with COVID-19, gendered structural factors, and spillover effects of US immigration policies impact the mental health of US Latina/os during a public health emergency. The results show that among Latinas, knowing an undocumented immigrant and someone ill with COVID-19 increases the probability of reporting worse mental outcomes by 52 percent. Furthermore, being a woman increases the probability of reporting the highest level of mental health problems by 30 percent among Hispanic people who know someone with COVID-19 and an undocumented immigrant. These findings indicate that the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak among US Latinas and Latinos are entrenched in gendered and systemic inequalities. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Though most scholars of race and politics agree that old-fashioned racism largely gave way to a new symbolic form of racism over the course of the last half century, there is still disagreement about how to best empirically capture this new form of racism. Racial resentment, perhaps the most popular operationalization of symbolic racism, has been criticized for its overlap with liberal-conservative ideology. Critics argue that racially prejudiced responses to the items that compose the racial resentment scale are observationally equivalent to the responses that conservatives would provide. In this manuscript, I examine the racial resentment scale for differential item functioning (DIF) by level of adherence to ideological principles using the 1992, 2004, and 2016 American National Election Studies. I find that responses to some of the racial resentment items are, indeed, affected by ideology. However, the problem is largely confined to 2016 and more egregious with respect to ideological self-identifications than adherence to ideological principles. Moreover, even after correcting for DIF, the racial resentment scale serves as a strong predictor of attitudes about racial issues. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the contemporary world of human mobility, one of the key problems is why different groups of people are welcomed in some places, but are driven away from others. Theoretical writings of geographers, sociologists, and architects suggest that place can be defined in two ways—as an essentialist, bounded entity with historical continuity or as an open, anti-essentialist space, supporting changes. We hypothesized that in the minds of lay people, these two types of places allow for either a small or high level of ethnic diversity, and thus a certain view of a place would have consequences for acceptance of outgroup members in that place. In three online experimental studies participants were asked to think of a real or imagined place focusing on its specific features, which were either essentialist or anti-essentialist. A consistent pattern of findings showed that conceiving of a place as anti-essentialist was related to greater openness towards the presence of ethnic outgroup members in that place compared to perceiving it as essentialist. Our study contributes to understanding which features of a particular place may foster its perception as more open and inclusive and, conversely, which features are related to a representation of the place as closed and unfriendly to certain ethnic groups. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous developmental research has consistently detected the presence of an explicit and implicit ingroup preference among preschoolers. More recent research has also demonstrated that this general ingroup bias is influenced by perceived social status when “real” groups are involved (i.e., groups with a previous history of interactions). Indeed, ingroup bias is significantly tempered among low-status group members. The main aim of the current study was to further investigate the role of social status by assessing both implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes in the context of newly formed groups. More specifically, children were randomly assigned to one of two fictitious groups on the basis of trivial criteria, thereby forming the so-called “minimal” groups. To manipulate group status, participants were then informed that one specific group—either the ingroup or the outgroup—was typically better than the other group during competitions. Finally, implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes were assessed. Overall, results showed that children rapidly formed implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes toward newly formed groups. Most important, the perceived status of the groups modulated such intergroup attitudes. Indeed, on both types of measures, ingroup bias emerged when the ingroup was associated with a high status, whereas it disappeared when the ingroup was in a low-status position. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction: The decision, whether to undergo fertility preservation or not is highly demanding for cancer patients. Decision aids may act as an additional source of support. So far, only a limited number of decision aids regarding fertility preservation for female cancer patients exist and have been evaluated systematically. This paper presents the results of secondary analyses of the first randomized controlled trial evaluating an online decision aid for female cancer patients affected by different types of cancer. It focuses on fertility-related knowledge, attitude toward fertility preservation, and long-term effectiveness regarding decisional regret. Material and methods: Young female cancer patients between 18 and 40 years of age were recruited after fertility counseling with a reproductive specialist. They were assigned to either the control group (counseling only) or the intervention group (counseling followed by the additional use of the decision aid). Both groups had to complete a questionnaire after counseling as well as 1 and 12 months later, covering topics such as fertility-related knowledge, attitude towards fertility preservation, decisional conflict and regret. Recruitment was ongoing during 18 months in eight fertility centers located in Switzerland and Germany. Results: Mean age of participating women was 29.31 years (SD 4.57). Of the entire sample (n = 51) 53% were affected with breast cancer, 27.4% with lymphoma, and 19.6% with various other types of cancer. Knowledge regarding the most common fertility preservation methods was high and comparable in both groups. Positive attitude significantly exceeded negative attitude among all participants (p = 0.001). Although the altogether low scores for decisional regret were on a higher level in the control group (T2: mean = 19.00, SD = 13.24; T3: mean = 22.0, SD = 20.67) than in the intervention group (T2: mean = 14.12, SD = 11.07; T3: mean = 12.94, SD = 13.24), there were no statistically significant differences between and within both groups. There was a positive association between decisional conflict and decisional regret at T3 (p = 0.001, r = 0.510). Conclusions: This decision aid was suitable as an additional source of knowledge and may positively impact decisional regret in the long term. Results suggest that the provision of an online decision aid as a complement to fertility counseling may facilitate decision-making. © 2021 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology (NFOG).

AB  - COVID-19 represents a multidimensional threat with the potential to worsen intergroup relations, but perceiving a common belonging with various outgroups may prevent intergroup tensions. During the Italian lockdown, we conducted an online survey with 685 Italian participants investigating whether perceptions of common belonging (belonging to a common group, sharing a common destiny, perceiving the difficulties faced by other groups) with disadvantaged and national outgroups were associated with perceived COVID-19 threat and prejudice-related individual differences, namely social dominance orientation (SDO), need for cognitive closure (NFC), deprovincialization, pre-lockdown positive and negative face-to-face contact with immigrants. We also explored the moderating roles of individual differences in the link between perceived threat and perceptions of common belonging. Results showed that common belonging was negatively associated with COVID-19 perceived threat, SDO, and NFC, and positively associated with deprovincialization and positive contact, with differences depending on the common belonging index and on the type of outgroup. Moderations showed that negative relationships between common belonging and COVID-19 threat held only at low levels of NFC (floor effect), deprovincialization, and positive contact. Summarizing, positive contact with minorities and openness to other cultures can favor a sense of communion with other social groups in a global health emergency. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Air pollution is one of the primary concerns of our society for its effect on human health and the environment. Among the policy measures that can be put in place to limit air pollutant emissions, end-of-pipe technologies and/or regulatory instruments may be implemented through legislative acts. Also, equally important are behavioural measures, requiring citizens’ active involvement. The success of any measure to limit pollutant emissions requires the acceptance by the citizens that, in turn, implies a correct perception of the main pollutant emission drivers. We present here the comparison between the public perception of air pollution sources and the real-world situation through a survey carried out in seven European countries and involving 16 101 respondents. Our study shows a dramatic underestimation of the contribution of the agri-food sector to air pollution. This result is common to all respondents in the seven countries examined and only to a small extent depends on gender, age and socio-economic status of the respondents. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Cybersecurity represents a unique national security challenge for states: data breaches with the potential for national, macro-level consequences are most likely to occur at the micro-level, originating through the security errors of individual computer users. Thus, aspects of national cybersecurity can often critically depend on the personal attitudes and behavior of average citizens connecting online. However, to date, theories of state cybersecurity have almost exclusively focused on the macro-level, and very little is known about how the mass public reacts to-and protects themselves from-cybersecurity threats. This study addresses this gap, drawing on psychological theories of risk perception to explain why the public simultaneously reports great concern about cybersecurity, yet does little to protect their personal safety online. Using a novel survey experiment, we examine how exposure to different types of data breaches impacts citizens' cyber risk assessments, personal online behavior, and support for various national cybersecurity policies. We find that baseline concerns about cybersecurity and knowledge about safe online practices are very low. However, exposure to a personally relevant data breach heightens risk perception and increases willingness to engage in safer online practices. But these effects are circumscribed-actual online behavior is more resistant to change. These results have important implications for the design of effective state cybersecurity policy. © 2020 The Author(s) (2020).

AB  - Scholars frequently invoke the term “women of color” (WOC) in their research, and, increasingly, the media make reference to WOC in news stories. Despite this common usage, researchers have failed to investigate whether the phrase WOC is politically advantageous. That is, do all women, black, Latina, Asian, white, and mixed-race women, support WOC candidates? This omission is unfortunate considering the large body of literature about race and gender politics concerned with descriptive representation and the extent of coethnic voting and gender affinity effects. Using original public opinion data, we draw on theories of intersectionality and social identity to hypothesize about how different subgroups of women respond to the prospect of electing more WOC to Congress. Consistent with group differences in the historic processes of racialization, our findings reveal considerable complexity within the WOC umbrella. Even within this complexity, we found that black and white women are the most distinctive in their preference for electing WOC. We contribute to the gender and race fields by identifying WOC as a politicized identity, and thus complicate and expand the study of descriptive representation. © 2020 University of Utah.

AB  - According to Daniel Snyder, owner of the National Football League Team formerly known as the Washington “Redskins,” “the name really means honor and respect.” For decades, Snyder pointed to polls that suggest majoritarian support among the American public to justify the continued use of the racially contested team moniker. However, Indigenous activists and their allies have long argued that the term “Redskins” is a racial slur. Using data from the 2014 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), this paper investigates the role of racial attitudes—specifically symbolic racism directed at Native Americans—in shaping public opinion about the name change during a period of heightened public attention to the debate over the team’s name. Our findings indicate that support for the continued use of the team’s name, though admittedly widespread among the American public, is in part influenced by negative racial attitudes directed at Native Americans. By engaging the literature on the politics of symbolic racism we demonstrate that, rather than “honoring” American Indians, those supportive of Native American mascots and symbols in professional football are significantly likely to begrudge them. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Research on human–wildlife interactions has largely focused on the magnitude of wildlife-caused damage, and the patterns and correlates of human attitudes and behaviors. We assessed the role of five pathways through which various correlates potentially influence human responses toward wild animals, namely, value orientation, social interactions (i.e. social cohesion and support), dependence on resources such as agriculture and livestock, risk perception and nature of interaction with the wild animal. We specifically evaluated their influence on people’s responses toward two large carnivores, the snow leopard Panthera uncia and the wolf Canis lupus in an agropastoral landscape in the Indian Trans-Himalaya. We found that the nature of the interaction (location, impact and length of time since an encounter or depredation event), and risk perception (cognitive and affective evaluation of the threat posed by the animal) had a significant influence on attitudes and behaviors toward the snow leopard. For wolves, risk perception and social interactions (the relationship of people with local institutions and inter-community dynamics) were significant. Our findings underscore the importance of interventions that reduce people’s threat perceptions from carnivores, improve their connection with nature and strengthen the conservation capacity of local institutions especially in the context of wolves. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - The large inflow of migrants into Europe in recent years has triggered more frequent discussions on how useful a pro-integrative migration policy is for society. There have been many studies considering various aspects of migrant integration policy, but its impact on social capital, particularly on an aspect as crucial as generalized trust, still requires further investigation. In our study, we use the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) and data on generalized trust and the mainstream population’s perceptions of group threat from immigrants using the European Social Survey (ESS) database to explore the relationship between generalized trust and both the total MIPEX and its components. Our database included 22 European countries and 39,079 respondents. We hypothesized that a pro-integrative migration policy would be connected with generalized trust indirectly via reduced perceived group threat from immigrants. The study identified a positive relationship between total MIPEX scores and generalized trust mediated via lowered perceptions of group threat. However, the effects of eight individual MIPEX components were discovered to be different. We discuss limitations related to the generalizability of our results, given that patterns may be different in North America where cultural distance between majority and most migrant groups is typically higher. We thus suggest that future research on generalized trust examine variables related to values and cultural distance and proximity between the mainstream and migrant groups. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2020.

AB  - During the 2016–2017 season, several NFL players started kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against institutional racism. These actions sparked considerable public controversy and polarized attitudes toward the protests. Two explanations were raised in the media for differences in attitudes: sensitivity to racial inequality and respect for tradition. We examined the extent to which these explanations, as assessed by ethnocentrism and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), respectively, accounted for attitudes toward the protests in a sample of white, U.S. college students (N = 294). When examined as simultaneous predictors, RWA, but not ethnocentrism, predicted more negative attitudes toward the protests. These findings suggest that attitudes toward the protests may have been based more on how the protest was enacted (respect for tradition), rather than the topic of the protest (racial inequality). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Importance: Curbing COVID-19 transmission is currently the greatest global public health challenge. Consumer digital tools used to collect data, such as the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, offer opportunities to reduce COVID-19 transmission but introduce privacy concerns. Objective: To assess uses of consumer digital information for COVID-19 control that US adults find acceptable and the factors associated with higher or lower approval of use of this information. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study obtained data from a nationally representative sample of 6284 US adults recruited by email from the web-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel in July 2020. Respondents evaluated scenarios reflecting uses of digital data for COVID-19 control (case identification, digital contact tracing, policy setting, and enforcement of quarantines). Main Outcomes and Measures: Levels of support for use of personal digital data in 9 scenarios to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 infection, rated on a Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Multivariable linear regression models were fitted for each scenario and included factors hypothesized to be associated with views about digital data use for COVID-19 mitigation measures. Black and Hispanic survey respondents were oversampled; thus, poststratification weights were used so that results are representative of the general US population. Results: Of 6284 individuals invited to participate in the study, 3547 responded, for a completion rate of 56%. A total of 1762 participants (52%) were female, 715 (21%) identified as Black, 790 (23%) identified as Hispanic, and 1224 (36%) were 60 years or older; mean (SD) age was 51.7 (16.6) years. Approval of scenarios was low, ranging from 28% to 43% (52%-67% when neutral responses were included). Differences were found based on digital data source (smartphone vs social media: coefficient, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.23-0.35]; P <.001; smart thermometer vs social media: coefficient, 0.09 [95% CI, 0.03-0.16]; P =.004). County COVID-19 rates (coefficient, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.13 for quartile 4 compared with quartile 1) and prior family diagnosis of COVID-19 (coefficient, 0.00; 95% CI, -0.25 to 0.25) were not associated with support. Compared with self-described liberal individuals, conservative (coefficient, -0.81; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.66; P <.001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.67 to -0.38; P <.001) individuals were less likely to support the scenarios. Similarly, large political differences were observed in support of the Apple-Google digital contact tracing program, with less support from conservative (coefficient, -0.99; 95% CI, -1.11 to -0.87; P <.001) and moderate (coefficient, -0.59; 95% CI, -0.69 to -0.48; P <.001) individuals compared with liberal individuals. Respondents from racial/ethnic minority groups were more supportive of the scenarios than were White, non-Hispanic respondents. For example, compared with White respondents, Black respondents were more supportive of the Apple-Google contact tracing program (coefficient, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.32; P =.002). Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of US adults, many were averse to their information being used on digital platforms to mitigate transmission of COVID-19. These findings suggest that in current and future pandemics, public health departments should use multiple strategies to gain public trust and accelerate adoption of tools such as digital contact tracing applications. © 2021 American Medical Association.

AB  - Negative attitudes and stigmatization can originate from the perception of a disease-related threat. Following the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is often suggested that incidents of discriminatory behavior are the result of defense mechanisms aimed at avoiding pathogens. According to the behavioral immune system theory, people are motivated to distance themselves from individuals who show signs of infection, or who are only heuristically associated with a disease, primarily because of the disgust they evoke. In this paper we focus on negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians who are among social groups that have been persistently framed as “unclean.” In our correlational study (N = 500 heterosexual participants; Polish sample data collected during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Poland, in March/April 2020) we tested moderation models derived from the behavioral immune system theory. Specifically, we investigated whether perceived vulnerability to disease and perceived threat of contracting COVID-19 moderate the relation between disgust and homonegativity. We found that sexual disgust (but not pathogen nor moral disgust) predicted homonegative attitudes. This effect was stronger for participants expressing higher levels of perceived vulnerability to disease but was not dependent on the perception of the COVID-19 threat. The results reaffirm previous evidence indicating a pivotal role of disgust in disease-avoidance mechanisms. They also point to functional flexibility of the behavioral immune system by demonstrating the moderating role of perceived vulnerability to disease in shaping homonegative attitudes. Finally, they show that the threat of COVID-19 does not strengthen the relationship between disgust and homonegativity. © Copyright © 2021 Szymkow, Frankowska and Galasinska.

AB  - Over the last couple of years, the topic of White fragility has garnered a considerable degree of attention. White fragility is considered a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress can become intolerable and trigger a range of emotional and behavioral reactions intended to restore a sense of racial comfort (DiAngelo, White fragility: Why it’s so hard for White people to talk about racism, 2018, Beacon Press). In effort to measure the expression of White fragility, we developed and evaluated the psychometric properties of the 21-item White Fragility Scale (WFS). Data consisted of two independent samples of White participants recruited from M-Turk (327) and a Midwest University’s Psychpool (234). Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses provided evidence for a bifactor model consisting of one general White fragility factor and three specific factors of Emotional Defensiveness, Accommodation of Safety, and Exceptionism. Ancillary bifactor indices supported treating the WFS as a unidimensional measure of White fragility yet also revealed meaningful utility of the Accommodation of Safety subscale. Concurrent validity evidence for the WFS was established through significant associations with modern racism, general and specific dimensions of colorblind racial attitudes, and social dominance orientation. In addition, nonsignificant, near-zero correlations with social desirability provided support for divergent validity. Recommendations for future research involving the WFS are provided as well as practical implications for professionals whose work requires a certain degree of racial stamina.

AB  - In the aftermath of the Icelandic economic crisis of 2008 Iceland's former Prime Minister Geir Haarde was convicted for negligence of his constitutional duty to consult with his ministers on measures to prepare for the coming crisis. The court ruled that there was sufficient information available to the government to conclude that there was real danger of a major banking crisis in the months preceding the crisis. Mr. Haarde was the only head of government to be convicted in the aftermath of the Financial crisis. His indictment and conviction was hotly debated in Iceland where many people considered the process unfair, primarily because Mr. Haarde was the only minister indicted by Parliament for negligence of duties although a Special Investigative Commission appointed by Parliament had recommended indicting other ministers and officials as well. The paper reviews the case against Haarde and the public reaction to it. It is argued that the majority of judges on the special court which convicted Mr. Haarde used the constitutional clause on the duty to conduct ministerial meetings to present a more wideranging condemnation of Haarde's failure to deal with and acknowledge the threats Iceland was facing. Public opinion changed over time: When the Parliament began its consideration of whether to indict former ministers surveys showed an overwhelming majority favoring indictments, but limited confidence that anyone would actually be indicted. When proceedings against Mr. Haarde started public support was much less. After the conviction opinion polls have shown growing doubts about the special court itself. The whole case is an interesting example of the elusiveness of accountability: The paper argues that a thoroughgoing moral reading of Mr. Haarde's conviction reveals a more damning analysis og his actions (and lack of actions) than has generally been acknowledged by political leaders and in public debates.

AB  - In Vietnam’s major urban areas, private motorcycles are the main means of transportation that are suitable for socio-economic conditions, current transport infrastructure, and people’s habits. However, in recent years, the negative effects of a large number and high density of motorcycles in urban areas such as traffic congestion and noise and air pollution have resulted in a gradual change in the public’s opinion of private vehicle adoption, especially motorcycles. The public has also urged the authorities to issue policies of limiting or curving the growth in the number of private vehicles powered by fossil fuels in big cities. However, in order to achieve the goal, other alternative means of transport should be proposed to encourage people to move to a more sustainable and eco-friendly form of mobility. The alternatives also should be consistent with the average income level as well as social characteristics. In recent years, along with the development of a highly connected public transport network, efficient and less-polluting vehicles including electric two-wheelers have been emerging, thriving, and drawing more attraction from Vietnamese people and policy makers. The spread in the number of electric two-wheelers in Vietnam’s major cities may be a sign of the transition to a more sustainable and less-polluting means of transport as an alternative to gasoline-powered motorcycles. In this paper, the authors aim to analyze the current road traffic status in Vietnam’s major cities, as well as shed a light on the transition to the greener and more efficient alternative vehicles to motorcycles in Vietnam’s urban traffic. Several recommendations for encouraging this vehicle type development are also important outcomes of this paper. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Dominican Republic is a uniquely valuable context in which to study children’s racial stereotyping and prejudice, in part because multiracial individuals comprise the majority of the population and race is viewed largely as a continuous rather than dichotomous construct. In two studies, we use developmental and social theories to ground an exploration of Dominican children's racial biases. In studies 1 (n = 54; ages 6–11) and 2 (n = 122; ages 6–11), children were given measures of racial identity, preference, stereotyping, and/or status. As expected, children identified their own race in a manner consistent with others (e.g., their teachers). Across a variety of tasks, children failed to consistently favor members of a specific racial group—as indicated by differing levels of racial stereotyping and associations of social status with different races. They did, however, sometimes systematically express greater liking of individuals of mixed racial heritage, a finding that was contingent on the modality of assessment (i.e., whether race was framed as a continuous vs. dichotomous category, and measured via nonforced vs. forced-choice methods). Implications for current theories of racial attitude development are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This study investigated children’s and adolescents’ predictions regarding intergroup inclusion in contexts where peers differed on two dimensions of group membership: race and wealth. African American and European American participants (N = 153; age range: 8–14 years, Mage = 11.46 years) made predictions about whether afterschool clubs would prefer to include a peer based on race or wealth and reported what they personally thought should happen. Between late childhood and early adolescence, European American participants increasingly expected that afterschool clubs would include a same-wealth peer (even when this peer was of a different race) whereas African American participants increasingly expected that the afterschool clubs would include a same-race peer (even when this peer was of a different level of wealth). Both European American and African American participants themselves thought that the clubs should include a same-wealth peer over a same-race peer, and with age, were increasingly likely to reference perceived comfort when explaining their decision. Future studies on the development of racial preferences will benefit from including wealth status information given that, with age, perceived comfort was associated with same-wealth rather than same-race status.

AB  - The current COVID-19 crisis raises the question of the role of transformative social policies (TSPs) during socio-economic crises. We used recent findings from an UNRISD survey of vulnerabilities and ILO's Social Protection Spotlight to examine the different roles of TSPs in the response to the COVID-19 crisis. We found that all TSPs are important, especially in terms of reaching vulnerable groups. They need, however, to be used simultaneously in an integrated manner to be successful and should be linked to crisis and disaster management. It is also important to enhance targeting of vulnerable groups within universalism to protect groups of individuals who require additional or different kinds of support, for example, migrant or informal workers. If these additional integrated policies become part of long-term development policies, they could be instrumental in ensuring that no one is left behind when the SDGs are implemented. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Social supermarkets were developed in Europe after the economic crisis 2008-2014. Their purpose is to decrease food waste that occurs in traditional food supply chains and to ensure access to food to socially endangered citizens. Objectives: This paper analyses the general perception of consumers regarding the mission and purpose of social supermarkets in four Central Eastern European (CEE) countries: Croatia, Poland, Lithuania, and Serbia. Methods/Approach: The paper brings the results of the survey research conducted in the observed CEE countries measuring attitudes towards the relevance and the role of social supermarkets. Results: There is a positive attitude regarding the existence of social supermarkets in all the analysed CEE countries. Less than 10% of respondents claim that there is no need for such organizations. In Croatia, Lithuania, and Poland examinees claim that reduction of food waste rather than reduction of poverty should be emphasized as a mission of social supermarkets. Conclusions: Social supermarkets require improvement of a legal framework, welfare system integration, and implementation of state monitoring. Moreover, larger involvement of religious communities, national and local governments, as supporting institutions is observed as a necessity in all the countries. © 2021 Blaženka Knežević et al., published by Sciendo 2021.

AB  - Background: Stigma refers to the sense of discrimination that society has towards a certain group of people, and this part of the group will also have a sense of shame due to their own negative circumstance. Young and middle-aged stroke patients need long-term effective support from their families and society, which can easily produce shame, and have a negative impact on disease treatment. Methods: A total of 94 young and middle-aged stroke patients admitted to our hospital from November 2018 to November 2020 were selected and randomly allocated to 2 groups, with 47 cases in each group. The control group received routine intervention, and the observation group received SHT intervention. The stigma, hope level, compliance with functional exercise, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and changes in activities of daily living were compared between the 2 groups before and after intervention. Results: The total scores of social interaction, treatment, ability, and stigma of the observation group were lower than those of the control group after 1 month of intervention (P<0.05). The observation group’s positive attitude towards reality and the future, taking positive actions, maintaining close relationships with others, and hope levels after 1 month of intervention were all higher than the control group (P<0.05). The functional exercise compliance of the observation group was higher than that of the control group after 1 month of intervention (P<0.05). The Barthel index score of the observation group was higher than that of the control group after 1 month of intervention, and the NIHSS score was lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). Conclusions: The application of SHT to young and middle-aged stroke patients can reduce stigma, improve hope level and compliance with functional exercise, improve neurological function, and enhance the ability for daily living. © Annals of Palliative Medicine.

AB  - This study examined the effect of collaborative learning (CL) versus traditional lecture-based learning (TL) pedagogies and gender group composition in effecting positive or negative attitudes of biology major and nonmajor men and women students. The experimental research method was administered in experimental and control groups to test the hypotheses. Students’ attitudes refer to their positive or negative feelings and inclinations to learn biology. A nine-factor attitude scale was administered in (1) single-gender nonmajor biology, (2) mixed-gender nonmajor biology, (3) single-gender major biology, and (4) mixed-gender biology major groups. Men (221) and women (219) were randomly assigned into single and mixed-gender classes without groups and single-gender groups (4M) or (4W) and mix-gender (2M+2W) groups. In CL nonmajor and major single-gender groups, women demonstrated significantly higher positive attitudes than men. In contrast, men’s attitudes were significantly improved in mixed-gender CL groups for major and nonmajor sections, and the effect size was larger in mix-gender classes. Women feel less anxious in single-gender groups but more anxious in mixed-gender groups. In mixed-gender groups, men’s self-efficacy, general interest, and motivation enhanced significantly; overall, men experienced greater satisfaction and triggered their desire to collaborate better, affecting all nine attitudinal factors. There was an interaction effect demonstrating the teaching pedagogy’s impact on improving students’ attitudes toward biology; students’ gender and gender-specific group composition have been the most influential factor for nonmajor students. These findings suggest that there is a need for developing gender-specific and context-specific learning pedagogies, and instructors carefully select gender grouping in teaching undergraduate science subjects. © 2021 Almasri et al.

AB  - What drives citizens’ support for violence against domestic political actors? Despite its potentially devastating consequences, there is surprisingly little research on the antecedents of this unique form of political violence. Building upon recent insights on the psychological implications of exposure to conflict on support for political violence, we examined the motivations underlying public support for violence against politicians in the context of protracted conflict. Using a two-wave panel design among Jewish-Israelis, we examined the interactive effects of conflict-induced perceived threat, psychological distress, and political orientation on support for violence against politicians. Consistent with previous findings on the psychological implications of conflict, our findings suggest that conflict-induced threat perceptions play an important role in predicting support for violence against politicians. Nevertheless, our findings point to important boundary conditions to these effects: the strength of the relationship between perceived threat and attitudes towards political violence is qualified by the level of chronic conflict-related psychological distress, and the direction of the effects of perceived threat is qualified by individuals’ self-placement on the left-right continuum. More specifically, we found that perceived threat increased rightists’ support and decreases leftists’ support for violence against politicians, only under high, but not low, conflict-related psychological distress. The main conclusion of this study is that support for violence against politicians can be seen as an ideology-driven protective strategy against the negative psychological implications of exposure to violent conflict. By pointing to the importance of understanding the interactive role of psychological and political factors in determining public support for such acts, our findings therefore contribute to the understanding of a relatively understudied phenomenon with potentially catastrophic effects on political stability. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a rise in support for political parties with an anti-immigration sentiment and nationalistic rhetoric as their distinguishing traits. Within this context, our study, through a survey, analyses the relation of prejudice toward immigrants with ideological postulates of right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance and outgroup threat. With a sample of 247 individuals (54.7% men and 45.3% women), our results reveal that positions favouring right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance and perception of realistic and symbolic threat have an influence on negative attitudes toward immigrants. At the same time, greater prejudice is found in those individuals scoring high in authoritarianism and symbolic threat. These results confirm, on one hand, the dual process motivation model of ideology and prejudice, and on the other, the bifactor structure of outgroup threat. As a conclusion, we propose that in order to foment peaceful coexistence and reduce hostility towards minority groups within today’s social context, it is important to consider the relevance of ideological postulates and outgroup threat. It is a priority to design public policies that favour the inclusion and integration of minority groups with the goal of building more sustainable societies that respect human rights. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - People’s knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) are a part of the public’s emergency response capability and play an important role in controlling public health emergencies. This study aims to evaluate Shanghai residents’ KAP and the response ability regarding public health emergency events in China. An anonymous questionnaire investigation including demographics, socioeconomic characteristics and KAP was conducted through the online survey system from April 19 to April 30 2020. Of the 1243 people who completed the questionnaire, 1122 respondents (90.3%) had a good, positive attitude, while only 46.8% of participants had good knowledge, 46.2% performed well in the aspect of practice and 19.5% of residents had good response capability. It was found that men (OR:1.57,95% CI: 1.16–2.13), and people with 10 to 12 years or longer than 12 years of education (OR: 2.08,95% CI: 1.14–3.92; OR: 3.56,95% CI: 1.96–6.72) had the best public emergency response capability. Positive attitudes may be significantly associated with good practice (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18–2.64). Internet and television were the major media for people to acquire knowledge and skills. A lack of knowledge, poor perception and poor emergency response ability were found in Shanghai residents. Target intervention should be developed and implemented to improve the knowledge and skills of people for dealing with public emergency events. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which public support for outbreak containment policies varies with respect to the severity of an infectious disease outbreak. Methods: A web-enabled survey was administered to 1017 residents of Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and was quota-sampled based on age, sex, and ethnicity. A fractional-factorial design was used to create hypothetical outbreak vignettes characterised by morbidity and fatality rates, and local and global spread of an infectious disease. Each respondent was asked to indicate which response policies (among five policies restricting local movement and four border control policies) they would support in five randomly assigned vignettes. Binomial logistic regressions were used to predict the probabilities of support as a function of outbreak attributes, personal characteristics, and perceived policy effectiveness. Results: Likelihood of support varied across government response policies but was generally higher for border control policies compared with internal policies. The fatality rate was the most important factor for internal policies, while the degree of global spread was the most important for border control policies. In general, individuals who were less healthy, had higher-income, and were older were more likely to support these policies. Perceived effectiveness of a policy was a consistent and positive predictor of public support. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that campaigns to promote public support should be designed specifically to each policy and tailored to different segments of the population. They should also be adapted based on the evolving conditions of the outbreak in order to receive continued public support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - What are the political effects of fiscal consolidations? Theoretical considerations suggest that consolidations should reduce the public's support for their governments, but empirical studies have found surprisingly small effects on government support. However, most of these studies analyze electoral outcomes, which are separated from the consolidation by a multi-link causal chain. We argue that more direct measures of government support, such as executive approval, show much stronger negative effects of consolidation, since they are less affected by the strategic timing of consolidations or the political alternatives on offer. We analyze a time series cross-sectional dataset of executive approval in 14 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries from 1978 to 2014, using the narrative approach to measure fiscal consolidations. We find that spending cuts decrease government approval, especially during economic downturns, but tax increases' impact on approval remains minimal. Finally, left-and right-wing governments are equally likely to lose approval after implementing austerity. ©

AB  - This paper investigates the link between residential context, perceptions and attitudes toward immigrants by linking data from the British Election Study with Census statistics on composition of electoral constituencies in 2001 and 2011. I consider which type of local diversity is most salient for natives’ attitudes by combining information on ethnicity, religion and skills. Second, I look at whether base levels of and changes in local diversity affect anti-immigration attitudes in the same way. I find that immigration is more salient when defined by ethnic criteria, rather than criteria that combine ethnicity and religion or skills. Anti-immigrant attitudes are more likely to be expressed by natives who live in constituencies where there has been a large change in diversity between 2001 and 2011, but these responses depend on initial diversity levels. For non-whites and skilled ethnic minorities higher residential segregation is associated with more negative attitudes toward immigrants among natives. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Cultured meat involves producing meat from animal cells, not from slaughtered animals. This innovation has the potential to revolutionize the meat industry, with wide implications for the environment, health and animal welfare. The main purpose of this paper is to stimulate some economic research on cultured meat. In particular, this paper includes a prospective discussion on the demand and supply of cultured meat. It also discusses some early results on the environmental impacts of cultured meat, emphasizing the promises (e.g., regarding the reduction in land use) but also the uncertainties. It then argues that cultured meat is a moral improvement compared to conventional meat. Finally, it discusses some regulatory issues, and the need for more public support to the innovation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Although the ways that immigrants relate to UK culture has been a hot topic since the EU-referendum, little attention has been given to how majority group members such as Host Country Nationals (HCNs) relate to immigrants’ culture. Thus, we explored English HCNs’ globalisation-based proximal-acculturation – the extent to which they prefer to adopt aspects of immigrants’ cultures and/or maintain their national culture. Using two-step cluster analysis, a pilot study (N = 63) revealed a separated, integrated, and undifferentiated cluster, with separated HCNs perceiving cultural diversity more as a threat and less as an enrichment. Using latent profile analysis in a second study (N = 220) also revealed a three strategy-solution, identifying assimilated, integrated and separated profiles. Again we examined how these strategies differed across perceptions of cultural threat and enrichment as well as other psychosocial characteristics: identifying with fellow English citizens, recognizing cultural differences whilst not being culturally embedded (constructive marginalization), and various forms of intergroup contact. Separated HCNs identified more with fellow English citizens, endorsed less constructive marginalization, perceived less cultural enrichment yet more cultural threat than HCNs following some of the other strategies. These results stress that the onus of cultural adoption lies with both groups – minorities and majority members – with English HCNs showing distinct proximal-acculturation strategies. Lastly, when exploring a variable-centred approach, proximal-acculturation orientations (cultural maintenance/adoption) mediated the relationship between cultural threat, cultural enrichment, and intergroup contact on positive feelings towards immigrants. Thus, the ways that HCNs acculturate may provide a new route towards harmonious intergroup relations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper analyses how terrorist attacks and high inflows of immigrants impact public attitudes towards immigrants from outside the European Union (EU). It makes an original contribution by analysing both effects in tandem, using an extended longitudinal framework to assess both shorter and longer term impacts and taking into account the role of uncertainty. Ordered probit regression models are applied to data from nine consecutive Eurobarometer (EB) surveys to examine impacts of 25 terrorist attacks in Western Europe in 2014–2018. Attacks with higher number of deaths significantly increase negative attitudes to immigrants although the effect fades over time. However, the 2015 migration crisis had a significant, greater and more sustained impact on attitudes towards immigrants than terrorist attacks. The differences in attitudes to migrants in the EU15 countries and post-communist countries provide support for the assumptions of the intergroup contact theory rather than the group threat theory. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Effective ecosystem management on the Tibetan Plateau will contribute to regional environmental sustainability, and these efforts need broad public support, especially that of residents, over the long run. Although residents’ subjective perceptions often directly influence practices, the interactive effects of subjective and objective indicators at the individual level often interfere with resident participation in ecosystem management. With the objective of decoupling the effects of multiple variables on resident participation in environmental sustainability, we launched a questionnaire survey on the topic of willingness to pay (WTP) on the Tibetan Plateau, and explored the effects of single variables and pairwise variables on WTP via dummy regression and proposed specific management suggestions. The results showed that objective indicators were the key drivers of WTP. First, it not only had strong direct effects on WTP (2770.32 CNY/year) but also interacted with subjective beliefs (3805.92 CNY/year); second, it had indirect effects on participation attitudes (R = 0.79) through subjective beliefs (R = 0.38). Put differently, the challenge of achieving sustainable management in the TP is how to enhance and satisfy the sociodemographic and socio-economic attributes of indigenous residents. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Moving to a post-growth economic paradigm requires research to identify compelling ways to more effectively communicate the key ideas of this transition to the public. This study uses framing theory to examine the effects of four message frames about transitioning to an economic paradigm not centered on economic growth. The four message frames were: environmental gain, environmental loss, well-being gain and well-being loss. The environmental loss frame generated more negative emotions, while the well-being gain frame produced more agreement with the message and more positive emotional reactions. While this study did not find evidence that the frames influenced participant's attitudes, it did confirm that the messages elicited frame-consistent thoughts, pointing to the importance of being strategic and deliberate in the frames selected for communicating post-growth ideas to the public. This study also examined initial reactions towards different economic terms that are increasingly being used to describe this transition. We found that the green economy was perceived as favourably as economic growth, indicating public support towards macroeconomic models that embed sustainability objectives. The appeal of terms like sustainable degrowth were more nuanced and mixed than what is usually suggested in academic debates. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Media outlets strategically frame news about violent events using sensationalist labels such as “terrorist” or “Islamist” but also more subtle wording choices that affect the overall article tone. We argue theoretically and show empirically using a conjoint experiment that, contrary to existing studies, the effect of these two framing devices on readers’ perceptions of terrorist events should be carefully separated. Even though article tone transports no factual information, in our experiment negative and sensational wording choices carried a greater impact on threat perceptions than the explicit “terrorist” and “Islamist” labels. In a realistic news article setting, which varied other salient context cues such as proximity or event size, subtle shifts in article tone still subconsciously influenced threat perceptions. This highlights the potential dangers of media coverage fueling otherwise unjustified fears by injecting unnecessary editorial tone. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Although pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key tool in HIV prevention efforts, little is known about PrEP as a prevention strategy for criminal justice-involved (CJI) women. The purpose of this study was to examine multilevel factors shaping PrEP awareness and acceptability among CJI women. Between January 2017 and December 2017, we conducted 52 interviews with CJI women at high risk for HIV and stakeholders from the criminal justice (CJ) and public health (PH) systems. Interviews explored awareness of PrEP and the multilevel factors shaping PrEP acceptability. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and executive summaries. Atlas.ti facilitated analyses. The majority of CJI women (n = 27) were, on average, 41.3 years, from racial and ethnic minority groups (56% Black/African-American; 19% Latinx) and reported engaging in recent high-risk behavior (nearly 60% engaged in transactional sex, 22% reported ≥ 4 sexual partners, and 37% reported injection drug use). Of system stakeholders (n = 25), 52% represented the CJ sector. Although CJI women were generally unaware of PrEP, attitudes toward PrEP were enthusiastic. Barriers to PrEP acceptability included medication side effects (individual level); distrust in HIV prevention mechanisms (community level); lack of local HIV prevention efforts among high-risk women (public policy/HIV epidemic stage level). Factors promoting PrEP included perceived HIV risk (individual level); PrEP being an HIV prevention method that women can control without partner negotiation (social and sexual network level); and availability of public health insurance (community level). Despite low awareness of PrEP, CJI women expressed positive attitudes toward PrEP. To improve PrEP access for CJI women, implementation efforts should address barriers and leverage facilitators across multiple levels to be maximally effective. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Because the prejudice of the ingroup builds into fear of the outgroup, jihadist terrorism is expected to strengthen the politicized link between security and immigration. I use a causal inference in a clustered cross-country analysis to test the simultaneous short-run causal impact of the jihadist threat on security fear and ethnic prejudice of the public in Israel, the Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, France, and Germany. In line with common wisdom, jihadist attacks significantly increase security fear. Against it, jihadist attacks non-significantly decrease ethnic prejudice. This empirical pattern holds in across different types of immigration attitudes, ethnic groups, intervals of time and terrorist events, and is robust to placebo treatments, placebo policy preferences, fake and failed terror attacks. These findings challenge extant consensus, and suggest that jihadist attacks, particularly at the local level, induce risk-aversion rather than desire for retaliation. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Previous qualitative researchers have shown that Chinese American mothers experienced high rates of suboptimal breastfeeding, especially early introduction of other foods before the recommended 6-month period of exclusive breastfeeding. Research aims: (1) To explore attitudes that Chinese American mothers have about the meaning and practice of exclusive breastfeeding; (2) to evaluate the extent of family pressure and support to maintain exclusive breastfeeding; and (3) to examine the influence of breastfeeding self-efficacy and the intention to continue exclusive breastfeeding. Method: Guided by the theory of planned behavior, this descriptive cross-sectional prospective online survey was conducted with Chinese American breastfeeding mothers (N = 401). Participants’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control for exclusive breastfeeding behaviors were measured. Results: The M (SD) age of participants was 29.14 (SD = 6.90). Just over 50% reported receiving family support for exclusive breastfeeding. While participants had positive attitudes about exclusive breastfeeding and the value of colostrum, 64% (n = 257) had already introduced foods other than mother’s own milk before their infant was 6-months old. Participants also expressed concern that their infants did not receive enough nutrition from exclusive mother’s milk. Participants with more than one child had significantly greater intention to continue exclusive breastfeeding compared to participants with only one child. Perception of approval by others for exclusive breastfeeding and breastfeeding self-efficacy were significantly related to behavioral intention to continue exclusive breastfeeding. Conclusion: Suboptimal infant feeding is a problem for Chinese American women and may also be a problem for mothers in other ethnic groups. We found a lack of adherence with standard recommendations for sustaining 6-months of exclusive breastfeeding. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objective: Sexual and gender minority people of color (SGM-POC) experience intersectional forms of minority stress, including heterosexism within racial/ethnic minority communities, which can contribute to feelings of conflict between SGM and racial/ethnic identities. Internalized stigma may be a consequence of sexual orientation-based discrimination but has not been tested as a mechanism linking intersectional minority stress to identity conflict among SGM-POC. We hypothesized that the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities and identity conflict would be mediated by internalized stigma among SGM assigned female at birth (SGM-AFAB). Method: Participants were 316 SGM-AFAB who identified as POC. Data were collected as a part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of young SGM-AFAB. We tested the longitudinal mediation using data from baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up assessments. Results: Internalized stigma at 6-month follow-up partially mediated the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities at baseline and identity conflict at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: For SGM-POC, experiences of heterosexism within their racial/ethnic communities may lead to internalization of those negative attitudes. A consequence of internalizing heterosexist attitudes from one’s racial/ethnic group could be a feeling that one’s sexual orientation and racial/ethnic identities must remain separate, perhaps to maintain connection to one’s racial/ethnic community. Identifying internalized stigma as a mediating process is critical to better understand identity development for SGM-POC, and has important clinical implications for working with this population.

AB  - Only recently research in social psychology has started to systematically investigate intergroup attitudes among members of stigmatized minority groups. In particular, the study of the way people with mental health problems perceive the social groups around them is so far very scarce. In this work, we focused on people with schizophrenia, analyzing their attitudes toward another stigmatized group, namely Black individuals. In Study 1, the attitudes toward White and Black people were assessed in a sample of respondents with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and in a sample of non-clinical individuals. Results showed the presence of less negative attitudes toward the minority outgroup (i.e., Black people) among the clinical sample. In Study 2, we aimed at investigating what members belonging to the majority group (i.e., White non-clinical people) believe about the attitudes toward Black people held by individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. In general, results suggested a general awareness in lay persons that people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, as compared to people with no history of mental disorders, hold reduced negative attitudes toward Black individuals. Overall, these results may help to enrich our knowledge about social cognition among members of stigmatized groups in general and, more specifically, among individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. © Copyright © 2021 Castelli, Carraro, Valmori, Uliana and Paparella.

AB  - As COVID-19 vaccines become available to the public, there will be a massive worldwide distribution effort. Vaccine distribution has historically been unequal primarily due to the inability of nations with developing economies to purchase enough vaccine to fully vaccinate their populations. Inequitable access to COVID-19 vaccines will not just cause humanitarian suffering, it will likely also be associated with increased economic suffering worldwide. This study focuses on the U.S. population and its beliefs about future COVID-19 vaccine donation by the U.S. to low- and middle-income countries. This study carried out a survey among 788 U.S. adults. Variables include demographics, COVID-19 vaccine priority status, COVID-19 vaccine donation beliefs, and Social Dominance Orientation. Analyses showed that older respondents were both less likely to endorse higher levels of COVID-19 vaccine donations and were more likely to want to wait until all in the U.S. who want the vaccine have received it; those who identified as Democrats were more likely to endorse higher levels of future COVID-19 vaccine donation than Republicans; and those scoring higher on SDO were both less likely to endorse higher levels of COVID-19 vaccine donations as well as more likely to want to wait until all in the U.S. who want the vaccine have received it. Policymakers, as well as healthcare providers and public health communication professionals, should give consideration to those messages most likely to engender support for global prevention efforts with each audience segment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Moral foundations research suggests that liberals care about moral values related to individual rights such as harm and fairness, while conservatives care about those foundations in addition to caring more about group rights such as loyalty, authority, and purity. However, the question remains about how conservatives and liberals differ in relation to group-level moral principles. We used two versions of the moral foundations questionnaire with the target group being either abstract or specific ingroups or outgroups. Across three studies, we observed that liberals showed more endorsement of Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness foundations) with an outgroup target, while conservatives showed more endorsement of Binding foundations (Loyalty, Authority, and Purity foundations) with an ingroup target. This general pattern was found when the framed, target-group was abstract (i.e., ‘ingroups’ and ‘outgroups’ in Study 1) and when target groups were specified about a general British-ingroup and an immigrant-outgroup (Studies 2 and 3). In Studies 2 and 3, both Individualizing-Ingroup Preference and Binding-Ingroup Preference scores predicted more Attitude Bias and more Negative Attitude Bias toward immigrants (Studies 2 and 3), more Implicit Bias (Study 3), and more Perceived Threat from immigrants (Studies 2 and 3). We also demonstrated that increasing liberalism was associated with less Attitude Bias and less Negative Bias toward immigrants (Studies 2 and 3), less Implicit Bias (Study 3), and less Perceived Threat from immigrants (Studies 2 and 3). Outgroup-individualizing foundations and Ingroup-Binding foundations showed different patterns of mediation of these effects. © Copyright © 2021 Stewart and Morris.

AB  - Although human existence is enveloped by ideologies, remarkably little is understood about the relationships between ideological attitudes and psychological traits. Even less is known about how cognitive dispositions - individual differences in how information is perceived and processed - sculpt individuals' ideological worldviews, proclivities for extremist beliefs and resistance (or receptivity) to evidence. Using an unprecedented number of cognitive tasks (n = 37) and personality surveys (n = 22), along with data-driven analyses including drift-diffusion and Bayesian modelling, we uncovered the specific psychological signatures of political, nationalistic, religious and dogmatic beliefs. Cognitive and personality assessments consistently outperformed demographic predictors in accounting for individual differences in ideological preferences by 4 to 15-fold. Furthermore, data-driven analyses revealed that individuals' ideological attitudes mirrored their cognitive decision-making strategies. Conservatism and nationalism were related to greater caution in perceptual decision-making tasks and to reduced strategic information processing, while dogmatism was associated with slower evidence accumulation and impulsive tendencies. Religiosity was implicated in heightened agreeableness and risk perception. Extreme pro-group attitudes, including violence endorsement against outgroups, were linked to poorer working memory, slower perceptual strategies, and tendencies towards impulsivity and sensation-seeking - reflecting overlaps with the psychological profiles of conservatism and dogmatism. Cognitive and personality signatures were also generated for ideologies such as authoritarianism, system justification, social dominance orientation, patriotism and receptivity to evidence or alternative viewpoints; elucidating their underpinnings and highlighting avenues for future research. Together these findings suggest that ideological worldviews may be reflective of low-level perceptual and cognitive functions.

AB  - Research investigating how social conditions influence attitudes about immigrants has focused primarily on demographic and economic factors as potential threat inducing contexts that lead to anti-immigrant sentiment. However, the empirical evidence supporting this link is mixed, while social cohesion indicators such as the influence of social trust, have largely been left unexamined. This article uses the European Social Survey (2002–2016) to test how differences in social trust, both within and between countries influence attitudes about immigrants. Results from longitudinal analyses show that countries with higher levels of social trust have more favorable attitudes toward immigrants, and while changes in social trust over time are small, they result in comparably large changes in anti-immigrant attitudes, even when controlling for other social factors. These results are robust across different model specifications and data sources. © Copyright © 2021 Mitchell.

AB  - Importance: As COVID-19 vaccine distribution continues, policy makers are struggling to decide which groups should be prioritized for vaccination. Objective: To assess US adults' preferences regarding COVID-19 vaccine prioritization. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study involved 2 independent, online surveys of US adults aged 18 years and older, 1 conducted by Gallup from September 14 to 27, 2020, and the other conducted by the COVID Collaborative from September 19 to 25, 2020. Samples were weighted to reflect sociodemographic characteristics of the US population. Exposures: Respondents were asked to prioritize groups for COVID-19 vaccine and to rank their prioritization considerations. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study assessed prioritization preferences and agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's Preliminary Framework for Equitable Allocation of COVID-19 Vaccine. Results: A total of 4735 individuals participated, 2730 (1474 men [54.1%]; mean [SD] age, 59.2 [14.5] years) in the Gallup survey and 2005 (944 men [47.1%]; 203 participants [21.5%] aged 55-59 years) in the COVID Collaborative survey. In both the Gallup COVID-19 Panel and COVID Collaborative surveys, respondents listed health care workers (Gallup, 93.6% [95% CI, 91.2%-95.3%]; COVID Collaborative, 80.0% [95% CI, 78.0%-81.9%]) and adults of any age with serious comorbid conditions (Gallup, 78.6% [95% CI, 75.2%-81.7%]; COVID Collaborative, 72.9% [95% CI, 70.7%-74.9%]) among their 4 highest priority groups. Respondents of all political affiliations agreed with prioritizing Black, Hispanic, Native American, and other communities that have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (Gallup, 74.2% [95% CI, 70.6%-77.5%]; COVID Collaborative, 84.9% [95% CI, 83.1%-86.5%]), and COVID Collaborative respondents were willing to be preceded in line by teachers and childcare workers (92.5%; 95% CI, 91.2%-93.7%) and grocery workers (85.9%; 95% CI, 84.2%-87.5%). Older respondents in both surveys were significantly less likely than younger respondents to prioritize healthy adults aged 65 years and older among their 4 highest priority groups (Gallup, 23.7% vs 39.1% [χ2= 2160.8; P &lt;001]; COVID Collaborative, 23.3% vs 28.8% [χ2= 5.0198; P =.03]). COVID Collaborative respondents believed the 4 most important considerations for prioritization were preventing COVID-19 spread (78.4% [95% CI, 76.3%-80.3%]), preventing the most deaths (72.1% [95% CI, 69.9%-74.2%]), preventing long-term complications (68.9% [66.6%-71.9%]), and protecting frontline workers (63.8% [95% CI, 61.5%-66.1%]). Conclusions and Relevance: US adults broadly agreed with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine's prioritization framework. Respondents endorsed prioritizing racial/ethnic communities that are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and older respondents were significantly less likely than younger respondents to endorse prioritizing healthy people older than 65 years. This provides reason for caution about COVID-19 vaccine distribution plans that prioritize healthy adults older than a cutoff age without including those younger than that age with preexisting conditions, that aim solely to prevent the most deaths, or that give no priority to frontline workers or disproportionately affected communities. © 2021 American Medical Association.

AB  - Currently, anti-immigrant sentiment has emerged again in European countries, as wit-nessed, for example, by the rise of xenophobic parties in many member states. This is a prejudice that is not new but that intensifies in certain circumstances, such as the economic crisis. This change in attitudes towards immigration has an impact on the preferences of citizens regarding the universal access to public resources and rights. The results of this article come from the analysis of certain variables of the Transnational European Solidarity Survey (TESS) conducted during 2016 in 13 member countries of the European Union. Specifically, two packages of variables are analysed regarding the degree of solidarity in relation to the access to public health services for immigrants before and after receiving scientific information about the collective benefits of the provision of health for the entire population, including undocumented immigrants. While there is much literature that analyses how scientific literacy in health and education issues improves the situation of vulnerable groups, few studies have analysed how scientific knowledge helps to modify the prejudices and discriminatory attitudes of the general population, thus contributing to the improvement of the health of the entire population. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The British Children’s Play Survey was conducted in April 2020 with a nationally representative sample of 1919 parents/caregivers with a child aged 5–11 years. Respondents completed a range of measures focused on children’s play, independent mobility and adult tolerance of and attitudes towards risk in play. The results show that, averaged across the year, children play for around 3 h per day, with around half of children’s play happening outdoors. Away from home, the most common places for children to play are playgrounds and green spaces. The most adventurous places for play were green spaces and indoor play centres. A significant difference was found between the age that children were reported to be allowed out alone (10.74 years; SD = 2.20 years) and the age that their parents/caregivers reported they had been allowed out alone (8.91 years; SD = 2.31 years). A range of socio-demographic factors were associated with children’s play. There was little evidence that geographical location predicted children’s play, but it was more important for independent mobility. Further, when parents/caregivers had more positive attitudes around children’s risk-taking in play, children spent more time playing and were allowed to be out of the house independently at a younger age. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black-Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black-Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Group dynamics are central to understanding race in America. Research reveals that Blacks and Latinos who report discrimination are more likely to feel interracial political commonality and intragroup linked fate. However, these findings may not extrapolate to Asian Americans, a heterogeneous group with a recent immigration history. This study examines whether type and context of perceived discrimination influence this relationship for Asian Americans. I find that interpersonal discrimination is associated with political commonality with Hispanics, whereas jobs discrimination is associated with political commonality with Blacks. Both are associated with intraracial and intraethnic linked fate. Neither housing discrimination nor police mistreatment predicts political commonality or linked fate. These findings suggest that promoting solidarity across and within racial groups requires acknowledging the differential impacts of perceived discrimination. © 2021 Russell Sage Foundation.

AB  - Blaming immigrants seems to be in part motivated by the need for control. However, three alternative explanations have been proposed as to why blaming bolsters feelings of control. First, blaming may restore a sense of an orderly world in which negative events can be attributed to a clear cause (causal attribution). Second, blaming others may strengthen in-group identities thereby facilitating group-based control (in-group identification). Finally, blaming low-status groups may enhance individuals' perceptions of dominance and superior status (hierarchy enhancement). Addressing these arguments, we conducted two survey experiments in the German context. In the first experiment, we examined the control-bolstering functions of causal attribution and in-group identification. Participants were primed with an economic crisis threat and then, given the opportunity to either blame out-groups (immigrants and managers), blame an abstract cause (globalization), or affirm their national identity. In the second experiment, we examine control enhancement in the context of political conflict and status hierarchies. Participants had the opportunity to either express prejudice toward low-status out-groups (immigrants and obese people) or indicate their opinion on the polarized issue of representation of the far-right. Both studies replicate earlier findings showing that anti-immigrant blaming and prejudice enhances the feelings of control. Neither mere causal attribution nor mere in-group identity salience produce similar control-bolstering effects. Instead, findings suggest that intergroup conflict and status differences benefit control the enhancement processes supporting accounts of both group-based control and social dominance. Findings are discussed with respect to social cohesion and the appeal of populist frames promoting antagonistic, unequal intergroup relations. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - What are the psychological processes responsible for the recent spread of populist political systems and movements? All political systems essentially reflect the mental representations of their populations, and collective narcissism has recently emerged as a contributing factor in the rise of populism. This article presents two studies examining the role of collective narcissism in predicting populist attitudes and voting intentions in Hungary. Hungary offers a particularly important case study of state-sponsored populism and illiberalism in Europe, as this country has gone furthest in undermining democratic principles and practices within the EU. To establish the pervasive role of collective narcissism we first review the historical evidence, survey research, and narrative analyses of Hungarian political representations. We then present two empirical studies where we predicted and found that collective narcissism was a significant predictor of negative attitudes toward the EU (Study 1), conservatism, and support for the ruling populist party (Studies 1 and 2). Collective narcissism predicted these variables independently from other factors, such as in-group positivity or perceived relative deprivation. However, once conservatism was controlled for the effects of collective narcissism faded out in some cases. The results nevertheless indicate that collective narcissism plays important role in promoting populist politics. The implications of these findings for understanding the psychological appeal of populism and illiberalism are discussed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The Piedmont South was historically characterized by strong linkages between its rural industries and urban distribution centers. These linkages have been diminished since the decline of the region’s textile and furniture industries in the early 1990s. After witnessing the growing inequality produced by this loss of economic and social interactions between the urban and rural portions of the Charlotte area, the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute embarked on the Carolinas Urban-Rural Connection (CURC) project in 2017. The intent of the project was to engage rural and small-town residents in the 75 miles around Charlotte and identify how the urban and rural economies of the region might be reconnected. Using the theoretical context of new regionalism, we encountered two trends we considered to be significant explanatory factors in rural economic decline and eventual resurgence. The first was an issue of leadership: small towns are struggling to identify and retain a new cohort of community leaders. The second was an issue of community identity: small towns are often challenged to cultivate unique economic, cultural, or social identities. However, we found them to be necessary to support meaningful economic development. This note outlines these two issues as they relate to rural and urban connections and interdependence. © 2021, University of North Carolina Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: This article compares responses to coronavirus control in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 3 countries in which public ageism erupted over the social and economic costs of protecting older adults from Covid-19. Methods: Thirty-five (35) newspapers, media websites, and current affairs magazines were sourced for the study: 8 for Australia, 12 for the United Kingdom, and 15 for the United States. Searches were conducted daily from April to June 2020, using key words to identify age-related themes on pandemic control. Results: Despite divergent policies in the 3 countries, ageism took similar forms. Public responses to lockdowns and other measures cast older adults as a problem to be ignored or solved through segregation. Name-calling, blame, and "so-be-it"reactions toward age vulnerability were commonplace. Policies banning visits to aged care homes angered many relatives and older adults. Indefinite isolation for older adults was widely accepted, especially as a vehicle to end public lockdowns and economic crises. Discussion: Older adults have and will continue to bear the brunt of Covid-19 in terms of social burdens and body counts as the pandemic continues to affect people around the globe. The rhetoric of disposability underscores age discrimination on a broader scale, with blame toward an age cohort considered to have lived past its usefulness for society and to have enriched itself at the expense of future generations. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Existing studies show that there is a positive association between pro-migrant integration policies and the subjective well-being of immigrants. However, there is a lack of research elucidating the relations between migrant integration policies and the subjective well-being of the host (i.e., non-migrant) population. This study is based on European data and uses multilevel analysis to clarify the relations between migrant integration policy (both as a whole and its eight separate components such as: Labor market mobility and Family reunion) and the subjective well-being of the non-immigrant population in European countries. We examined relations between the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX) for 22 countries in Europe and subjective well-being, as assessed by the European Social Survey (ESS) data. The results demonstrated that there is a positive relation between the MIPEX and subjective well-being for non-immigrants. Considering different components of the MIPEX separately, we found most of them being positively related to the subjective well-being of non-immigrants. As no negative relationship was identified between any of the eight MIPEX components and subjective well-being, policies in favor of immigrant integration also seem to benefit the non-immigrant population. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - An improved understanding of public support is essential to design effective and feasible climate policies for aviation. Our motivation is the contrast between high support for air travel restrictions responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and low support for restrictions to combat climate change. Can the same factors explain individuals’ support for restrictive measures across two different problems? Using a survey, we find that largely the same factors explain support. Support increases with expected effectiveness, perceived threat and imminence of the problem, shorter expected duration of the measure, knowledge, and trust, while support decreases with expected negative consequences for self and the poor. When controlling for all perceptions, there is no significant residual difference in support depending on whether the measures address climate change or COVID-19. The level of support differs because COVID-19 is perceived as a more imminent threat, and because measures are expected to be shorter-lasting and more effective. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is ongoing debate about how the funding system for social care of older people in England should best be reformed. We investigated how public attitudes to individual and state responsibility for paying for social care in later life vary with demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Four vignettes of individuals in need of home care or residential care with varying levels of savings, income and housing wealth were presented to a sample of people aged 18–75 years (n = 3000) in December 2018. Respondents were asked if care costs should be paid by the user, the state or shared. They were also asked about the best way to pay for social care in old age. Latent class analysis was used to identify sub-groups with similar preferences for paying for care, and to explore their socio-demographic characteristics. We identified five classes. The majority (Class 1, 58%) preferred that the state and the user should share social care costs. Class 2 (18%) thought that the state should pay all costs regardless of users' savings, income or housing wealth. Class 3 (15%) preferred users to pay all costs at all levels of savings, income and housing wealth, with the exception of those unable to afford the costs. Classes 4 and 5 (5% each) were characterised by different patterns of ‘don't know’ answers. Socio-economic status was higher among those proposing higher user contributions (Class 3) and lower among those with several ‘don't’ know’ responses (Classes 4 and 5). Concerns about care costs in old age were high among those proposing that the state pays all costs (Class 2) and those preferring that users pay all costs (Class 3). This study shows that public views on social care funding vary with respondents' characteristics and that proposals to reform the system need to be carefully calibrated. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Rationale and objective: Research has documented a robust mental health advantage among Asian and Latino immigrants to the United States relative to the native-born. The current investigation extended this line of research, asking whether Middle Eastern immigrants to the United States enjoy a similar mental health advantage. Methods: Drawing on pooled cross-sections from the 2007–2018 National Health Interview Surveys, we used OLS regression to examine psychological distress in Middle Eastern immigrants relative to both native-born Whites and immigrants from other global regions. We used statistical interactions to assess whether gender and period differences are contingent on region of birth. Results: Findings reveal that the average level of psychological distress is higher among Middle Eastern immigrants than among both U.S.-born Whites and immigrants from other regions. Despite changing circumstances of migration for Middle Easterners and implementation in the United States of anti-immigrant policies, we see no evidence that distress increased more among immigrants compared to native-born Whites. Results point to greater psychological distress among Middle Eastern women than their native-born White counterparts and women from other immigrant groups, as well as Middle Eastern men. In contrast, psychological distress levels for Middle Eastern and native-born White men were indistinguishable, suggesting that the Middle Eastern mental health disadvantage in the United States is borne solely by women. Conclusions: Results show that the mental health advantage enjoyed by some immigrant groups does not extend to Middle Eastern women, contradicting the healthy migrant model and challenging the assumption of a uniform mental health advantage across immigrant groups. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - During the last decade critical social psychologists have developed an interest in studying locational dimensions of intergroup relations and temporal aspects of social identity. At the same time critical social psychological research on acculturation has emphatically stressed the dynamic and situated nature of the processes of migrant integration and/or exclusion. Building on these strands of research, the present paper argues that spatial/temporal aspects of migrant integration need to be further explored and their critical social psychological study could benefit by insights from the interdisciplinary field of urban studies. Specifically, the notion of urban citizenship can enable an actor-centered, bottom-up perspective in the research of integration, considering it as part of the process of “becoming local” rather than as a process of interaction between homogenous ethnic groups. Furthermore, emphasis on the local and temporal dimensions of appropriating (or being excluded from) urban/community resources can contribute to a multifaceted and situated dynamic approach to migration, to avoid reified conceptualizations of integration, to highlight the discontinuities and disruptions that characterize new mobilities and to question binary oppositions between receiving and sending societies and host and guest populations. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This paper analyzes public attitudes about the International Court of Justice (ICJ). We explore two questions: (1) Why are some people in favor of submitting their country's disputes to the ICJ while others are opposed? (2) How can we explain variations in public support for compliance with a costly ICJ ruling? We argue that individual-level attitudes about both issues are driven by different psychological dynamics. While we expect that cost-benefit calculations and cosmopolitan social identity will affect attitudes in both contexts, people's views on compliance should also be shaped by their level of social dominance orientation (SDO). Our statistical analysis is based on original survey data, collected in Belize in April 2019. We obtain three main findings. First, people's ex ante beliefs about the costs of an ICJ ruling have tangible effects on attitudes toward ICJ adjudication. As predicted, higher expected costs lead to decreased support for adjudication. Second, cosmopolitanism is positively associated with support for adjudication, but it has no effect on attitudes about compliance with international court rulings. Third, high-SDO respondents are less likely to favor the implementation of a costly ICJ verdict. However, SDO only reduces support for compliance in individuals with narrow social identity attachments. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Affective empathy, feeling what others feel, is a powerful emotion that binds us to one another. Here we ask whether how we mentally represent the scene in which another suffers informs our emotions. For example, when we learn about someone suffering outside of the here and now, such as a refugee devastated by violence or famine, does a manipulation potentiating our ability to simulate the scene around the victim heighten our empathic response? Expanding recent advances in the memory literature, we investigate the link between activating our ability to imagine events—episodic simulation—and empathy for in-group and out-group members in a series of online and laboratory studies (N = 1010). Incidental manipulations of episodic simulation, unrelated in content and structure to the empathy judgment task, increased overall empathy for both in-group as well as out-group members. This relationship was mediated by participant-generated episodic detail of the victim's surroundings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - One of the major drivers of societal conflict are the intergroup relations which rely mainly on social identity and which are rarely analyzed for immigrant groups. This article changes this point of view by investigating the extent to which national, ethnic, and religious identities relate to outgroup hostilities towards the majority of the German population, towards other immigrant groups, and towards Syrian refugees among immigrant-origin citizens. We employ a theoretical framework based on the social identity approach and use new representative survey data from 2017 for Germans of Turkish descent (N = 480) and Russian Germans (N = 471). Based on multivariate linear regression analysis, we show that ethnic identity has the strongest positive relation with outgroup hostilities, with the exception of the Russian-Germans' evaluation of the German majority population. National identity among Germans of Turkish descent lessens their hostility towards other immigrants. Our results show the importance of analyzing immigrant groups with different migration trajectories separately before making generalized claims. Not only are the identity relations different between an ingroup identification and various outgroup targets, but they are also different between the immigrant groups for the same ingroup identification and outgroup target. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This paper presents two cross-sectional survey studies, both conducted in Britain, which focus on how different cultural identities are managed in multicultural settings. Specifically, the studies explored the extent to which essentialism moderates the perceived compatibility of acculturation orientations, heritage culture maintenance and majority culture adoption. In study 1, participants (N = 198) were Somali minority members living in the UK. It was found when minority members essentialized Britishness themselves, and when they perceived that British people essentialized Britishness, they saw a desire to maintain the culture of origin and a desire adopt the majority culture as conflicting with each other. In study 2, participants (N = 200) were white British majority members living in the UK. Findings showed that when white British majority members essentialized Britishness, they too perceived the two acculturation preferences as being incompatible with each other. Taken together, these studies show that essentializing British identity can lead to a view that the majority and minority cultures are mutually exclusive. Implications for intergroup relations and integration into British society are discussed. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Social movements pushing for social change are often met with reactionary counter-movements that defend the status quo. The present research examined this interplay by focusing on the role of racial majority group members claiming collective psychological ownership. We examined collective ownership that stems from being native to the land and from being founders of the nation. Study 1 found that in Malaysia, the Malay majority group endorsed more native ownership than Chinese and Indian minorities, which in turn predicted greater threat in response to protests demanding electoral reforms and subsequently greater support for a reactionary pro-government movement. Situated in the United States, Study 2 found that the more that White Americans endorsed founder ownership beliefs, the more they reported negative attitudes towards the Black Lives Matter protests, which in turn predicted more support for White nationalistic counter-protests. This effect was stronger among White people compared to people of colour. Study 3 examined both founder and native ownership in Australia. Founder (but not native) ownership beliefs predicted more negative attitudes towards Invasion Day protests, which subsequently predicted more support for counter-protests defending Australia Day celebrations. Implications of culture-specific beliefs about collective ownership for social movement research are discussed. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Minorities do not always welcome apparently positive stereotypes of their group. At first sight, this may appear churlish. However, we show that minority group members’ theorizing on the production and operation of apparently positive stereotypes helps explain such a negative reaction. Reporting interview data (N = 30) gathered with Hungarian Roma, we differentiated several bases for a negative response to the popular stereotype of Roma as possessing a distinctive musical talent. Although participants recognized the stereotype had instrumental value in easing everyday intergroup encounters, they also reported that the stereotype reflected the majority group’s power to define Roma identity; constrained recognition of qualities that they themselves valued; limited their abilities to act on terms that were their own; and could facilitate the reproduction of more negative Roma stereotypes. Taken together, these findings imply our participants saw this apparently positive stereotype as speaking volumes about the majority’s power to define Roma identity without reference to how they themselves defined their identity. We conclude with a discussion of the analytic value of the concept of ‘misrecognition’ in explaining negative responses to a positive stereotype. We also discuss the potential for such an apparently positive stereotype to facilitate improvements in intergroup relations. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement’s rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a “war on cops.” Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model. © 2020, Southern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - The perceived collective continuity (PCC) of a national identity serves as a crucial source of stability and self-esteem for group members. Recent work has explored the consequences of perceived continuity when the meaning of a nation’s past is seen in a negative light, and the challenges this brings for the negotiation of a positive identity in the present, signalling the potential value of perceived discontinuity The current paper extends this literature by examining the role of intergroup relations in the construction of both collective continuities and discontinuities. Through analysing the discursive management of national identity in nine focus groups in a post-conflict context (Serbia, N = 67), we reveal how the tensions between continuity and discontinuity are embedded within a broader discussion of the nation’s relationship with relevant national outgroups across its history. The findings contribute to theoretical knowledge on the interlinking of national identity and PCC by illustrating the ways in which intergroup relations of the past shape the extent to which continuity is seen as desirable or undesirable. We argue that despite the psychological merits of collective continuity, discontinuity can become attractive and useful when there is limited space to challenge how a nation’s history is remembered and the valence given to the past. The paper concludes by offering an account of how social and political contexts can influence the nature, functions, and valence of PCC within national identities. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Drawing on the Canadian case, this study examines whether, in a multinational state, majority and minority nations emphasize different criteria when tracing the borders of their respective national community. It does so by comparing native-born French speakers in Quebec and native-born English speakers in the rest of Canada from three different perspectives. We examine (a) the way ascriptive and attainable groupings of characteristics are constructed in Quebec and in the rest of Canada, (b) the importance given to attainable and ascriptive characteristics, and (c) the implications of ascriptive and attainable characteristics for attitudes toward immigration and generalized trust. The findings suggest that majority-group members in Quebec and in the rest of Canada broadly draw the boundaries of their nation in similar ways and with similar implications. © 2020 Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - National and European policies aim to facilitate the integration of Roma people into mainstream society. Yet, Europe’s largest ethnic group continues to be severely discriminated. Although prejudice has been identified to be at the core of this failure, social psychological research on anti-Gypsyism remains scarce. We conducted a study in six countries using student and community samples (N = 2,089; Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Norway, Italy, Spain) to understand how anti-Gypsyism among majority-group members predicts unfavorable acculturation preferences toward Roma people. Openly negative stereotypes predicted acculturation preferences strongly across the countries. However, stereotypes about the Roma receiving undeserved benefits were also relevant to some degree in East-Central Europe, implying that intergroup relations are framed there as realistic conflict. Stereotypes about traditional Roma culture did not play a central role in acculturation preferences. Our findings highlighted that anti-Gypsyism may be an impediment to integration efforts, and efforts should be context-specific rather than pan-national. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This field experiment tested whether inducing common inclusive representations (i.e., one group, dual identity) during contact influences intergroup relations differently for ethnic majority and minority children by changing their metaperceptions and intergroup emotions differently. White (N = 113) and Black (N = 111) 8- to 10-year-old children were exposed to interactive mixed-ethnicity sessions in schools emphasizing either categorization as one group (national group), dual identity (national group with ethnic subgroups), or two ethnic groups. Overall, as predicted, for White children, one-group, but not dual-identity perceptions, improved behavioral intentions by influencing metaperceptions. For Black children, dual-identity, but not one-group, perceptions improved behavioral intentions through metaperceptions. Contrary to the expected, both dual-identity and one-group perceptions were associated with White and Black children’s intergroup emotions. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The social dominance–environmentalism nexus proposes that orientations for inequality and domination are expressed both in human–human and human–nature relations. In two studies, the present work applies and extends this proposition to understand endorsement of environmental values, concern with climate change, support for climate policies, and responsibility for climate action. In study one, using a representative random sample from Portugal (N = 1270, 53.3% female; European Social Survey, ESS8), social dominance orientation showed unique associations with concern with climate change. Moreover, opposition to immigration (as expression of anti-egalitarianism in intergroup relations) showed unique associations with all four measures of environmentalism. In study two, multi-level analyses using representative random samples from 20 other countries in Europe (N = 38830, 51.5% female; ESS8) confirmed the associations between opposition to immigration and environmentalism, controlling for a set of sociodemographic covariates, political orientation, and nesting at the country level. However, there were differences in the strength and direction of these associations based on country levels of societal development (i.e., Human Development Index; HDI). These differences reinforce the notion that context or situational variables may shape the links between diverse expressions of (anti-)egalitarianism and (anti-)environmentalism. Inputs for applied research on hierarchy-affirming tendencies toward others and the natural environment are proposed and discussed. © 2020 International Association of Applied Psychology

AB  - Research shows that felt age among older adults is a good proxy for their current and future physical and mental health. Using both quantitative and qualitative interview data, we examined correlates of and self-reported reasons for felt age among 102 low–socioeconomic status (SES), non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic older adults who were members of a senior activity center. Fewer activities of daily living (ADL)/instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments, more positive affect, and higher self-efficacy were associated with higher odds of feeling younger, while financial stress was associated with lower odds. The most common self-reported reasons for younger felt age were staying active, followed by good health, positive attitudes, exercise/dancing, independence, interpersonal/intimate relationships, faith/spirituality, volunteering, family, driving/traveling, and being of sound mind. Poor health, lack of energy, and limited ability to engage in activities were self-reported reasons for older felt age. Senior center programs that enable older adults to stay active and socially integrated may contribute to their well-being. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In the last decade, a growing body of research has revealed that morality is the most important driver of impression formation. As such, social targets lacking morality are disliked and kept at distance, while moral targets are liked and respected. Here, we investigated whether social targets lacking morality elicit positive reactions in the observer. Study 1 revealed that participants reported an enhanced self-view when confronted with an immoral (vs. moral) behavior performed by a political opponent. Study 2 revealed the key role of morality in this process, as differential perceptions of the target’s incompetence had no comparable effect on the observer self-view. Importantly, such results emerged when participants were highly identified with their ingroup. Taken together, these findings suggest that outgroup immorality can elicit positive self-related responses in the observer. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications for social judgment and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Since 2015, refugee numbers in Europe have risen to an all-time high. Despite the desperate conditions of most refugees, many European countries have been reluctant to accept them. We investigate how refugees are received in five European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Turkey) and the perceptions of the general population on these refugees. Our data were collected through face-to-face interviews (N = 2,649) in Turkey and an online survey (N = 6,000) in Western Europe. Our findings indicate that positive socio-economic conditions are related to more positive attitudes at the country level, whereas a high number of refugees are related to more negative attitudes. On the individual level, we find that attitudes are shaped by economic class, religiosity, religious piety, and settlement conditionality. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Integrating social identity threat and structural hole theories, this work examines how social network positions affect group-based identity threats. For individuals less well positioned to bridge (or “broker”) relations between unconnected friends, stigma-by-association concerns may constrain affiliation with stereotypic targets. Three experiments (Ns = 280, 232, 553) test whether women (vs. men) in male-dominated STEM (vs. female-dominated) majors avoid befriending a female target with feminine-stereotypic (vs. STEM-stereotypic) interests. Only STEM women with less brokerage (i.e., less ability to manage introductions to unconnected friends) in their existing friendship networks avoided befriending (pilot experiment) and socially integrating (Experiments 1 and 2) feminine- (vs. STEM-) stereotypic targets, despite standardized target similarity and competence. STEM women in particular anticipated steeper reputational penalties for befriending stereotypically feminine peers (Experiment 2). Social identity threat may lead women in STEM—especially those lacking brokerage—to exclude stereotypically feminine women from social networks, reinforcing stereotypes of women and STEM fields. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Although trust in, and cooperation with, the police is critical to effective crime prevention, the relationship between citizens and police can be tenuous, especially for ethnic minorities. However, the impact that membership in multiple marginalised groups has on attitudes toward the police has received limited attention. We address this oversight using a national probability sample of New Zealand adults (N = 11,669) to examine how the intersection between ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) affects trust in, and willingness to cooperate with, the police. As hypothesised, minorities trusted the police less than did ethnic majority group members. However, ethnic group differences in trust in the police were heightened at low (vs. high) levels of SES. In turn, trust in the police mediated the relationship between minority status and willingness to cooperate with the police. These results demonstrate that (low) SES exacerbates the already fragile relationship between ethnic minorities and the police. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Research suggests political identity has strong influence over individuals’ attitudes and beliefs, which in turn can affect their behavior. Likewise, firsthand experience with an issue can also affect attitudes and beliefs. A large (N = 6,383) survey (Pew Research and Ipsos W64) of Americans was analyzed to investigate the effects of both political identity (i.e., Democrat or Republican) and personal impact (i.e., whether they suffered job or income loss) on individuals’ reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that political identity and personal impact influenced the American public’s attitudes about and response to COVID-19. Consistent with prior research, political identity exerted a strong influence on self-reports of emotional distress, threat perception, discomfort with exposure, support for restrictions, and perception of under/overreaction by individuals and institutions. The difference between Democrats and Republican responses were consistent with their normative value differences and with the contemporary partisan messaging. Personal impact exerted a comparatively weaker influence on reported emotional distress and threat perception. Both factors had a weak influence on appraisal of individual and government responses. The dominating influence of political identity carried over into the bivariate relations among these self-reported attitudes and responses. In particular, the appraisal of government response divided along party lines, tied to opposing views of whether there has been over- or under-reaction to the pandemic. The dominance of political identity has important implications for crisis management and reflects the influence of normative value differences between the parties, partisan messaging on the pandemic, and polarization in American politics. © Copyright © 2021 Collins, Mandel and Schywiola.

AB  - Purpose: Attitudes toward minority employees are hard to predict, and there is no enough information about the variables that are associated with increased and decreased prejudice toward them. The Jewish and Arab education systems in Israel are, for the most part, segregated, which may potentially contribute to prejudice and alienation between the two populations. The integration of Israeli–Arab teachers in Jewish schools has been suggested to reduce prejudice. The current study sought to examine Israeli teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ) and its relation to degree of religiosity, minority status and demographic variables. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,644 teachers completed an online 22-item questionnaire that surveyed background variables such as gender, mother tongue, seniority and degree of religiosity, the two independent variables, religiosity and minority status, and the dependent variable, attitude toward the inclusion of AJ. Findings: Overall, teachers exhibited positive attitudes toward the integration of AJ. Multiple linear regression indicated that among Jewish teachers, the degree of religiosity was the strongest predictor of the teachers' attitudes toward inclusion but was a poor predictor among Arabs. Conversely, minority status was the strongest predictor among Arab teachers but was a poor predictor among Israeli Jews. Not only did religiosity differ in its prediction of attitudes among Arabs and Jews but also the patterns of religiosity were quite different among these two groups. Research limitations/implications: While the overall sample was wide, the specific minority groups that were examined were small and did not allow deep exploration of minority nuances. The study's generalizability is hampered by the given exceptionality of the Israeli context, where “Church” and State are not separated. Religiosity was examined in a unidimensional way and failed to explore other related factors that may be relevant, such as political inclination. Practical implications: The study further refutes the notion of commonality among minorities. It proposes to place more emphasis on religion's role in attitudes toward minority employees. Further research into the role of religiosity in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward Arabs is needed. Social implications: The findings suggest that the degree of religiosity might be a central factor in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward the Arab minority in general. Originality/value: The research calls attention to the association of Judaism and nationalism as well as segregation, contributing to negative attitudes and prejudice toward the Arab minority. Unlike previous research using contact theory, the authors call attention to the importance of examining willingness to make contact prior to examining the impact of contact itself. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Human behavior altered in different socioeconomic conditions is the main contributor to deteriorating air quality, therefore changing the behavior is the goal of air policies. In this study, we propose an integrated framework to figure out the roles of socio-physical environments in promoting air quality control policies through behavioral perspectives. The study selects Changhua County in Central Taiwan, composed of 26 cities and townships, as a case study to investigate the impacts of social and economic factors and the air quality on individual's knowledge, attitude and behavioral intention. The socioeconomic and environmental factors are collected from Taiwanese official information, while the knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the policies are obtained through questionnaires. Subsequently, multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis and redundancy analysis are utilized to simultaneously identify the causal relationships between socio-physical environments and the knowledge, attitude, and intention in different townships. Our findings suggest that individual's knowledge, attitude, and intention toward the air polices cannot be raised simply in commensurate with the growth of the economy and the deterioration of air quality. Indeed, people living in highly urbanized regions and being well-educated, particularly in Changhua City, are less willing to take actions for air quality improvement although they are susceptible to environmental risks. On the contrary, people close to nature have more environmental knowledge, positive attitudes and more intentions to improve the air quality. The finding results will be beneficial to authorities in each city/township to organize environmental education plans corresponding to their socioeconomic conditions and behavioral patterns. © 2020

AB  - Professional development has been recognized as one of the strategies to effectively combat sexual prejudice and negative attitudes against lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning/queer (LGBQ+) individuals and sexual minorities. Nevertheless, studies related to LGBQ+-inclusive training are rarely found in the Chinese Hong Kong context, where sexual prejudice still prevails without the establishment of antidiscrimination law. Sociocultural considerations, such as religious and parental influences, are obstacles to discussing the reduction of sexual prejudices, both within wider society and social work organizations, without institutional support. This paper aims to understand social workers’ perspectives on prejudice reduction training themes and perceived cultural barriers through qualitative in-depth interviews with 67 social workers. Qualitative thematic analysis yielded the following themes: (1) understanding sexuality; (2) initiating training legitimately; (3) contesting religious and cultural assumptions; (4) resolving value and ethical dilemma; (5) selecting relevant knowledge; (6) implementing diverse training strategies. The study suggests that social workers and service providers need to understand how sexual prejudice is manifested in Hong Kong through unique cultural forces. LGBQ+-inclusive content, addressing updated concepts and prejudice-free language, should be incorporated into the training curriculum. Intergroup contact, professional reflection, and experiential learning are suggested as training strategies (190). © 2021 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Social Identity Theory (SIT) is commonly applied to explain social change. We aim to revive interest in the concept of social creativity in order to provide a SIT perspective on bolstering and challenging social stability. Social creativity allows people to maintain or achieve a positive social identity through re-interpreting intergroup relations. Despite this crucial role in shaping intergroup comparisons, the causes and effects of social creativity are largely unknown. To understand how social creativity can contribute to social stability, we argue for a return to SIT's dynamic nature of constantly renegotiating intergroup relations, involving both higher- and lower-status groups. Within these dynamics, we propose that social creativity can play the roles of coping with, promoting, and questioning social stability. Additionally, we outline a research agenda for future research on social creativity and discuss the impact that social stability can have in societies. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - There is widespread concern that funding for protected and conserved areas (PCAs) will decline substantially due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic outcomes. This paper makes the case that the impacts of the global crisis do not in themselves introduce novel financial threats to PCAs; rather, they serve to magnify, intensify and exacerbate existing structural and systemic financial constraints and weaknesses. To respond appropriately, it is therefore important to understand the status of PCA finance before COVID-19, and to address the underlying barriers and constraints to PCA financial sustainability. Based on known PCA finance challenges, and predicted effects from COVID-19, the authors present nine overarching recommendations for building a sustainable finance base for PCAs: diversify the funding base; improve spending effectiveness and efficiency; ensure domestic budgets continue to support PCAs; increase international development finance and philanthropy; strengthen revenue generation from tourism; support PCAs governed by Indigenous peoples, local communities and private actors; include local communities in PCA governance and benefits; engage the finance sector and attract private capital; and raise public support and interest in nature conservation and PCAs. Specific activities and tools are provided to support each of these recommendations, whilst respecting the current global context. © 2021, IUCN - International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

AB  - Background: The largest effort undertaken in precision health research is the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), also known as the All of Us Research Program, which aims to include 1 million or more participants to be a part of a diverse database that can help revolutionize precision health research studies. Research participation from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in precision health research is, however, limited; this includes Vietnamese Americans, especially those with limited English proficiency. PMI engagement efforts with underserved communities, including members of minority populations or individuals who have experienced health disparities such as Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency, may help to enrich the diversity of the PMI. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the attitudes towards and perceptions of precision health, motivations and barriers to participation in precision health research, and acceptability of SMS text messaging as a recruitment and intervention strategy among underserved Vietnamese Americans. Methods: A community sample of 37 Vietnamese Americans completed a survey and participated in one of 3 focus groups classified by age (18-30, 31-59, and ≥60 years) on topics related to precision health, participation in precision health research, texting or social media use experience, and insights on how to use text messages for recruitment and intervention. Participants were recruited via community organizations that serve Vietnamese Americans, flyers, word of mouth, and Vietnamese language radio announcements. Results: Most participants had little knowledge of precision health initially. After brief education, they had positive attitudes toward precision health, although the motivation to participate in precision health research varied by age and prior experience of research participation. The main motivators to participate included the desire for more knowledge and more representation of Vietnamese Americans in research. Participants were open to receiving text messages as part of their research participation and provided specific suggestions on the design and delivery of such messages (eg, simple, in both English and Vietnamese). Examples of barriers included misinterpretation of messages, cost (to send text messages), and preferences for different texting platforms across age groups. Conclusions: This study represents one of the first formative research studies to recruit underserved Vietnamese Americans to precision health research. It is critical to understand target communities' motivations and barriers to participation in research. Delivering culturally appropriate text messages via age-appropriate texting and social media platforms may be an effective recruitment and intervention strategy. The next step is to develop and examine the feasibility of a culturally tailored precision health texting strategy for Vietnamese Americans. © 2021 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Creativity is a critical element of sustainable development. In current paper it is described through Social Identity by identifying the main factors that shape the background of creativity. We conclude that health, maturity, and positive attitudes of cultural change as well as the social stabil-ity, the environmental care and finally, the incentives, material and non‐material, shape the human creative dynamism. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - We investigated whether collective narcissism (i.e., believing that the in-group is exceptional but insufficiently recognized by others) and in-group satisfaction (i.e., believing that the ingroup is a source of satisfaction) have opposite, unique associations with intergroup aggression via belief in the hedonistic function of revenge (i.e., an expectation of emotional reward from harming others in response to feeling oneself harmed). Results of two studies conducted in Poland (N = 675) found that collective narcissism is positively related to belief in the hedonistic function of revenge, whereas in-group satisfaction is negatively related, and both are related to intergroup aggression. These relationships were found only when the overlap between collective narcissism and in-group satisfaction was partialled out. The results shed a new light on the mechanisms linking in-group positivity to out-group derogation, and highlight the importance of investigating revenge motivations in the intergroup relations. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. The best prevention for COVID-19 is avoiding exposure to the virus. Some studies reported health professional s practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-Administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15, and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association declared at P 0.05. Results In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants. Marital status, being married (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI: 1.06, 3.18), good knowledge on the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR = 2.02, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.18), and positive attitude towards precautionary measures for the COVID-19 were factors showed significant association with the practice. Conclusions The magnitude of good practice of precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic among health professionals was low. As such, different interventions to improve the knowledge and attitude of health professionals in the health care system are highly needed to boost the practice and to advance service delivery. © 2021 Public Library of Science.

AB  - Background: Psychological well-being (PWB) is predictive of future health and mortality. Midlife is a pivotal time in women's lives and may impact future PWB. This study, based on a longitudinal cohort of women, sought to identify how personal and social resources and modifiable behaviors at midlife relate to women's PWB in later life, and to determine if psychological resilience in later life moderates the impact of health problems on PWB. Materials and Methods: We assessed the association of midlife factors with PWB ∼9 years later in 1693 women from the multiracial/ethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) cohort. PWB was a composite score with cognitive and affective components. Midlife factors included sociodemographics, health, menopause-related, and psychosocial factors collected over the course of midlife. Results: In a multivariable model, greater PWB at an older age was associated with the following at midlife: less financial strain, greater physical activity, not smoking, better physical functioning, and fewer sleep problems. More positive attitudes toward menopause and aging, less cynicism, greater optimism, less trait anxiety, greater spirituality, and greater resilience were also independently associated with better PWB. Chinese women reported lower PWB compared with whites. Later life resilience moderated the impact of sleep problems on PWB. Conclusions: Several modifiable factors at midlife are associated with better PWB in older women and highlight the importance of healthy behaviors such as physical activity and good sleep hygiene at midlife. Interventions to increase optimism, spirituality, and resilience are also worth exploring. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - The unequal burden of environmental hazards in minority communities has been widely studied in environmental justice (EJ) research, mainly motivated by health disparities among minority populations. This article provides an overview of EJ legislation, policies and trends, and potential future directions. First, we examine EJ policies and legislation introduced in the United States as a measure of political attitudes to provide a big picture of the general political attitudes toward EJ. Second, we use institutional incrementalism and punctuated equilibrium frameworks to examine historical changes in this multifaceted policy area. We argue that the overall picture is more aligned with punctuated equilibrium and that the punctuated nature of EJ policy highlights the important role of local environmental activism as a form of policy inertia to challenge the status quo. Moreover, by analyzing the central themes of EJ policies (health, health disparities, and cancer disparities), we conclude that the essence of environmental activism should evolve into a more interdisciplinary platform with a focus on health disparities and preventive measures for more effective framing of EJ discourses. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - For a long time, since China’s opening to the outside world in the late 1970s, admiration for foreign socioeconomic prosperity and quality of life characterized much of the Chinese society, which contributed to dissatisfaction with the country’s development and government and a large-scale exodus of students and emigrants to foreign countries. More recently, however, overestimating China’s standing and popularity in the world has become a more conspicuous feature of Chinese public opinion and the social backdrop of the country’s overreach in global affairs in the last few years. This essay discusses the effects of these misperceptions about the world, their potential sources, and the outcomes of correcting misperceptions. It concludes that while the world should get China right and not misinterpret China’s intentions and actions, China should also get the world right and have a more balanced understanding of its relationship with the world. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Intergroup contact is an established pathway to improve intergroup relations. Research has long focused on mainly positive intergroup contact and its capability to improve intergroup relations. Yet, if members of different groups meet, they will not only make positive, but possibly also negative intergroup contact experiences. Recent research considering both positive as well as negative intergroup contact has raised concerns about potentially stronger effects of negative compared to positive contact. These new insights and the increasing awareness of potentially detrimental effects of contact could lead to doubts about whether it is always sensible to bring individuals from different groups together. Our article first updates the latest review on joint effects of positive and negative intergroup contact. We find that there is no clear tendency for either positive or negative intergroup contact to yield stronger effects on intergroup relations, and we portray factors that might influence these effects. Such factors—for example an individual's prior experiences—could play a crucial role in defining the relevance of negative contact in everyday settings. We continue by answering calls to increase a more qualitative understanding of what kinds of experiences are seen to be intergroup contact, and where intergroup contact in everyday life is experienced from a lay understanding, with new qualitative data from British White and British Asian individuals. Our results demonstrate that positive as well as negative contact is often rather casual and happens in public spaces and at work. Interventions explicitly addressing these spaces may help to reach more people. We also demonstrate that positive contact is much more frequent than negative contact. This finding is confirmed in the third section, which reviews the relative frequency of positive and negative intergroup contact. Last but not least, we discuss the implications of our review for practitioners and researchers alike. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Academic assessments typically conclude that right-wing authoritarian populism poses a significant political challenge to the advancement of climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. Right-wing recalcitrance and hostility to climate change policy have been attributed to the authoritarian personality, rejection of science, skeptical views of government elites and corporations, and even some forms of psychological distress. Employing public opinion data collected in the U.S. during the first term of the Trump Presidency, our work confirms that persons who score high on populism, authoritarianism, anti-science indices, and those who hold ideologically conservative views tend to oppose increased public investment in alternative energy. Not explored in the environmental policy and alternative energy literature is the conflicted (or compassionate) conservative; the individual who espouses conservative values yet supports social justice-promotive public policies. As an addition to current theoretical and empirical understanding, we find that conflicted conservatives, individuals who identify as politically conservative yet favor social justice expenditures, are significantly more supportive of enhanced public investment in alternative energy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the wake of the global refugee crisis, children are exposed to negative attitudes from public and private spheres. Previous research has identified family, peer, and school norms as significant predictors of children's inter-ethnic attitudes. We extend this literature by examining normative influence from wider society, which has received substantially less attention. Among 266 children (Mage = 11.24), this study investigates the relative contributions of norms from five ingroups (family, class-peers, Irish, religious and all-humanity) to predict children's anti-refugee bias. Perceptions of positive family and religious norms were the strongest unique predictors of contact intentions and warmth towards refugees. Intergroup anxiety and perceived threat mediated these relationships. Social dominance orientation mediated family normative influence only. These findings highlight the importance of broader groups (beyond that of proximal ingroups) for understanding children's intergroup attitudes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public debates portray Arab Muslims as universally opposed to homosexuality due to Islam. Those Orientalist claims are mirrored by large-scale studies that argue Muslims oppose homosexuality more than non-Muslims. We argue that assuming religion and opposition to homosexuality are unidimensional concepts obscures how they relate to each other and why; we study both “religiosity” and “opposition to homosexuality” multidimensionally. WVS data on 9000 Arab Muslims show, first, that although most respondents reject both homosexuality and homosexuals, one in five reject homosexuality but do not object to having homosexual neighbors. A substantial minority of Arab Muslims thus “hate the sin but love the sinner”. Multilevel analyses show that stronger religious attachment increases opposition to homosexuality and homosexual people. However, all other dimensions of religiosity we study (textualism, mosque attendance, and altruism) also reduce some oppositions. Consequently, the argument that Arab Muslims’ religiosity only leads to opposition to homosexuality is too simplistic. © 2021

AB  - Few attempts have been made to examine the effects of perceived threats that immigrants pose to host society on young people's preferences for restrictionist or lenient immigration policies. Moreover, the existing literature is scarce on whether such perceived threats mediate the relationship between previously identified demographic antecedents such as gender, race or age and preferences for certain immigration policies. To address these gaps, this study examines direct and mediating effects of perceived economic, cultural and security threats on preferences for lenient or restrictionist immigration policies. Using a sample college students' survey data (N = 604) on their attitudes towards immigration, our findings of logistic regression analysis show that the three dimensions of perceived threat were all positively associated with preference for hardline immigration policies. In addition, regardless of inclusion of perceived threats in the logistic model, being Republican was a consistent positive predictor of the hardline immigration agenda, while female was a consistent negative one. Finally, the results of path analysis of Structural Equation Modeling indicate mediating effects of cultural threat on the relationships between political affiliation (Republican and Independent) and race (Latino) and support for hardline immigration policies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Consistent with the intergroup contact literature, cross-political relationships (e.g., friendships or romantic relationships between different partisans) may help reduce inter-political group prejudice. Given that unfavorable attitudes based on the political group membership are particularly heightened at present in the United States, we explored whether having cross-political friendships (Study 1) or romantic relationships (Study 2) predict more positive interpersonal or intergroup attitudes among American Democrats and Republicans. In Study 1, using a social network measure (N = 301), where participants reported on their closest friends, cross-political (versus same-political) friendship was associated with less positive interpersonal attitudes when this relationship was unsatisfying. Having any (versus no) or more (versus less) cross-political group friendships was not associated with holding more positive intergroup attitudes. In Study 2, cross-political romantic relationships were examined (N = 392). Having a cross- (versus same-) political romantic relationship was associated with relatively less positive attitudes toward the political outgroup via lower empathy when relationship satisfaction was low. Study findings highlight the potential limitations of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The aim of the paper was a study of public opinion of the inhabitants of the European Union as regards the reaction and perception of the COVID-19 pandemic on the basis of weekly reports of the Eurobarometer: Public opinion monitoring in the time of COVID-19, containing data from member EU countries (March-July 2020: first wave of pandemic). It was assumed that during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the lack of a sense of security (health, economic and social) was the result not by personal experience (a real threat), but was cultivated and communicated by the media, creating a culture of fear. The opinions were analyzed in three problem domains: health, economy and society, taking into account fears and their functions, experiences and declarations for solving the problems generated by the pandemic. A quantitative analysis of the content of the reports was applied as well as a qualitative analysis of the content and an analytical-descriptive one. Seven research hypotheses were accepted, of which 3 were affirmed: fear of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects is presently a more widespread problem than the pandemic itself. The level of fear as regards the effects of the pandemic exceeds the level of negative experiences. In the domain of the health effects, the greatest fear is engendered by contact with COVID-19 which may cause infection: 14 fears. The remaining hypotheses were refuted: the level of fear of inhabitants of EU countries regarding health consequences/dangers (46) does not exceed the level of fear regarding economical (75) and social (19) consequences/dangers. In the domain of economical consequences/dangers, the most fears: 37, are caused by fear of an economical crisis and not one of unemployment (17) - as was assumed. Social isolation is more often experienced (13) and present in declarations (16) of inhabitants of the EU than in their fears (4). Fears of the consequences/dangers of COVID-19 plays, most of all, a negative function (137/74) and not a positive one - as assumed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous studies have examined the link between creativity and stereotyping, with most reports indicating that encouraging stereotype-confronting thinking can foster creativity. We hypothesized that encouraging creative thinking can also influence intergroup relations. In two experiments with adolescents, we tested whether creative imagination (N = 211) and divergent thinking (N = 317) had an impact on prejudice. We found that stimulating creative thinking elicited lower social distance toward minority groups (Experiments 1 and 2) and higher general tolerance (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2, a manipulation in which experimental stimuli were schema-consistent resulted in a decrease in prejudice; however, schema-inconsistent stimuli did not. We discuss potential implications in the context of addressing discrimination. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A growing strand of the literature finds a causal negative impact of terrorism on undifferentiated discriminatory attitudes toward Muslims, migrants, and other minorities. In this paper, we argue that jihadist terrorism threatens first and foremost Muslims. To evaluate this claim, we estimate the causal effect of jihadist terrorism on the perceived discrimination among Muslims through a 2×2 quasi-experimental design. Exploiting “natural experiments” driven by exogenous variation in terror threat caused by jihadist attacks that unexpectedly occurred during the fieldwork of a large survey, we compare the perceived ethoracial discrimination of the relevant minority (Muslims) against other minorities (non-Muslims) before and after five different terror attacks in five different European countries. We find that jihadist attacks increase perceived ethnoracial discrimination among Muslims while reducing it among non-Muslims, and that individual-level factors including social status and economic insecurity mitigate public opinion responses to a greater extent than group-level factors do. Hence, while in-group attitudes toward out-groups tend to be undifferentiated, the experience of out-groups in the aftermath of jihadist attacks depends on the specific identity of the respondents. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Previous research has shown that positive intergroup contact among disadvantaged group members may predict a so-called sedative effect according to which positive contact is associated with reduced support for social change. Conversely, positive contact is associated with increased support for social change toward equality among advantaged group members. This raises the important question of under which circumstances intergroup contact can encourage support for social change among both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. In this theoretical article, we tackle this question by introducing a new Integrated Contact-Collective Action Model (ICCAM). We first provide an up-to-date review of how intergroup contact may promote or hinder social change for both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We, then, use ICCAM to examine when the many forms of intergroup contact promote or hinder support for social change, proposing the existence of two different paths for disadvantaged and advantaged group members. Finally, we discuss the implications of the model for social intervention and make policy recommendations stemming from a review of available evidence. © 2020 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues

AB  - Over the past two decades, politicians and intellectuals have lent support to rising anti-immigrant sentiments, ethno-nationalist integralism and far-right populism by coining expressions such as ‘cultural exclusion’ and claiming to be speaking in the name of the ‘people’, often under cover of anti-political correctness. In this article I identify a series of recurrent features of such ethno-nationalist identitarian theories. The book I am critiquing, PC Worlds: Political Correctness and Rising Elites at the End of Hegemony (2019) by Jonathan Friedman, is a clear example of these trends. The scholar who had previously critiqued racialized politics and the reification of cultures now offers a book in favour of anti-immigrant ethno-nationalism and radical cultural othering. The article shows how this is the result of contradictions related to the evolution in his own thinking and situates these contradictions in regard to different theories of the nation-state. It also demonstrates how Friedman has proceeded to hollow out his own previous model, by making a distorted and normative use of it, and points out a number of weaknesses, particularly regarding the notions of ‘elites’ and ‘hegemony’. Finally, it questions the very project of conducting a study of political correctness. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Political protests cannot succeed without public support. Extant studies point to weaker average support among ideological conservatives, but researchers have yet to consider the extent to which such apparent ideological asymmetry is (a) an artifact of the particular protest cases that researchers have tended to investigate, and/or (b) conditioned by the precise meaning of “ideological conservatism.” In this investigation, we address these gaps. Specifically, we analyze public perceptions of protest legitimacy after exposing survey respondents to one of a series of experimental treatments that randomize the specific ideological and issue contents of the particular protests under consideration. In iterative models, we observe how political ideology, social dominance orientation and authoritarianism condition the effects associated with these experimental treatments. The data suggest that that the notorious ideological asymmetry that is often associated with support for protests is authentic, but it is also conditioned in important ways by these other factors. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - We conducted an experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of vicarious contact in the relationship between Turkish and Syrian elementary school children; the participants were Turkish children. We used a mixed-methods approach, investigating effects by using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to read stories on positive contact between Turkish and Syrian children over the course of six weekly sessions. The results revealed that vicarious contact, compared to a control condition where participants did not engage in any activity, led to greater intentions to help outgroup members. Importantly, effects only emerged among children who reported higher initial negative outgroup attitudes. Results from qualitative data revealed that vicarious contact produced richer, more positive, and complex representations of the relationships and friendships between groups. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine the consequences of helping an outgroup in an intergroup context where the threat to the ingroup and outgroup varied. Fourth and eighth graders (N = 126; fourth graders: Mage = 9.07 years, SD = 0.38; eighth graders: Mage = 12.84 years, SD = 0.34) were asked whether excluding an ingroup member who helped an outgroup by sharing equally or not was acceptable. Equal helping or outgroup helping occurred when the groups had equal need for a vital resource, the outgroup needed it more, or the ingroup needed it more. Overall, excluding the helpful ingroup member was viewed as unacceptable. It was least acceptable when the outgroup needed the help and was given more help than the ingroup. Exclusion was judged to be most acceptable when both groups needed the same amount of help, or the ingroup needed more help, but more help was given to the outgroup, and these findings were driven by fourth graders. Participants’ social cognitions regarding perceptions of group interest, group identification, and approval of the helping act predicted their acceptability of excluding the helping member. Concerns for group loyalty were used to justify exclusion, but appeals to the emotional harm of exclusion, generosity, and the low salience of the act of helping were used to reject exclusion. The findings contribute to developmental research on intergroup relations and exclusion from peer groups. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background and purpose: This small study explores group identification among healthcare students. Identifying with a professional group serves professional identity formation. Social Identity Theory however shows how social identification with a group can result in negative attitudes towards ‘out-groups’, possibly other health professions. Method: 276 Final-year nursing and medical students received a questionnaire measuring strength of social identification (SSI) with their professional group and their interprofessional team, and querying their views on interprofessional feedback and who they viewed as team members. Results: 38 Medical and 15 nursing students responded. Mean SSI differences were found favouring the professional group, statistically significant for the nursing students. Participants had a broad view of their interprofessional team and valued interprofessional feedback. Discussion and conclusions: Despite the mean SSI differences, final year students’ broad perspective of team members and openness to interprofessional feedback suggest that group processes do not hinder the development of inclusive, interprofessional attitudes. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - We provide and test a theory explaining how and why racial attitudes shape public opinion on government spending in the United States. We hypothesize that many people think the government allocates money unfairly across racial groups, and “inequity aversion” leads them to reject spending as a result. Using data from an original survey, we find support for our theory in the sample as a whole, and within racial, partisan, and ideological subgroups. Indeed, unfairness views are comparable to partisanship in their relationship to opinion on spending. While prior work has shown that whites’ racial attitudes are correlated with opinion on specific government programs, we show they shape opinion about the appropriate level of government spending writ large. We also move beyond the study of white opinion, measuring views of unfairness in the distribution of spending among racial minorities as well. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Purpose: Attending surgeons must participate in critical and key portions of procedures and otherwise be immediately available. However, surgeon-defined standards of the critical and key portions of surgery have been questioned, potentially affecting trainee graduated responsibility. This study compares the opinions of surgeons and the general public regarding what constitutes the critical portions of carpal tunnel release (CTR). Methods: A survey was devised inquiring about the appropriateness of surgical trainee execution of each step of CTR. Surgeons who perform CTR were queried (n = 112) and 32 (29%) responded. The survey was modified to compare responses from a sample of 184 nonmedical respondents (NMRs). The NMRs were excluded if they indicated having a career in health care. Results: Of the surgeon respondents, 94% (n = 30) had completed hand fellowship training, 53% (n = 17) declared themselves academic or affiliated with academia, and 53% (n = 17) utilized concurrent operating rooms. The NMR average age was 35.3 ± 10.3 years, 40% were female (n = 73), and they represented various regions of the United States including an assortment of socioeconomic and ethnic groups. Surgeons demonstrated significantly more hesitation with trainees performing surgical steps. Academic surgeons were significantly more comfortable having trainees performing surgical steps than nonacademic surgeons. Critical portions of CTR as agreed upon by surgeons and NMRs included incision, dissection, transverse carpal ligament division, and inspection of the median nerve for injury/complete release. Conclusions: Surgeons are significantly less comfortable with trainee performance of CTR steps than the general public. Surgeons who regularly work with trainees are more accepting of trainee involvement than those who do not. Clinical relevance: Understanding the opinions of surgeons as well as NMRs with respect to surgical trainee participation in the operating room is important to optimize the informed consent process as well as influence hospital policies that affect graduated surgical trainee autonomy. © 2021 American Society for Surgery of the Hand

AB  - Background: Developing appropriate concussion prevention and management paradigms in middle school (MS) settings requires understanding parents’ general levels of concussion-related knowledge and attitudes. This study examined factors associated with concussion-symptom knowledge and care-seeking attitudes among parents of MS children (aged 10–15 years). Methods: A panel of 1224 randomly selected U.S. residents, aged ≥ 18 years and identifying as parents of MS children, completed an online questionnaire capturing parental and child characteristics. The parents’ concussion-symptom knowledge was measured using 25 questions, with possible answers being “yes”, “maybe”, and “no”. Correct answers earned 2 points, “maybe” answers earned 1 point, and incorrect answers earned 0 point (range: 0–50; higher scores = better knowledge). Concussion care-seeking attitudes were also collected using five 7-point scale items (range: 5–35; higher scores = more positive attitudes). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models identified predictors of higher scores. Models met proportional odds assumptions. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) (excluding 1.00) were deemed statistically significant. Results: Median scores were 39 (interquartile range: 32–44) for symptom knowledge and 32 (interquartile range: 28–35) for care-seeking attitude. In multivariable models, odds of better symptom knowledge were higher in women vs. men (aOR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.71–3.05), white/non-Hispanics vs. other racial or ethnic groups (aOR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.42–2.49), higher parental age (10-year-increase aOR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.26–1.71), and greater competitiveness (10%-scale-increase aOR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.13–1.36). Odds of more positive care-seeking attitudes were higher in white/non-Hispanics vs. other racial or ethnic groups (aOR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.06–1.99) and in older parental age (10-year-increase aOR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.05–1.47). Conclusion: Characteristics of middle school children's parents (e.g., sex, race or ethnicity, age) are associated with their concussion-symptom knowledge and care-seeking attitudes. Parents’ variations in concussion knowledge and attitudes warrant tailored concussion education and prevention. © 2020

AB  - After 2 decades as a low-cost transplant centre in India, our rates of kidney transplantation are low compared to the burden of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We performed this study to identify possible barriers inhibiting paediatric kidney transplant and to assess the outcomes of paediatric ESKD. A retrospective chart review of ESKD patients (2013 - 2018) at a tertiary paediatric nephrology centre was conducted. Medical/non-medical barriers to transplant were noted. Patient outcomes were classified as “continued treatment,” “lost to follow-up (LTFU)” or “died.” Of 155 ESKD patients (monthly income 218 USD [146, 365], 94% self-pay), only 30 (19%) were transplanted (28 living donor). Sixty-five (42%) were LTFU, 19 (12%) died, and 71 (46%) continued treatment. LTFU/death was associated with greater travel distance (300 km [60, 400] vs 110 km [20, 250] km, P <.0001) and lower monthly income (145 USD [101, 290] vs 290 USD [159, 681], P <.0001). Among those who continued treatment, 41 proceeded to transplant evaluation of whom 13 had no living donor and remained waitlisted for 27 months (15, 30). The remainder (n = 30) did not proceed to transplant due to unresolved medical issues (n = 10) or a lack of parental interest in pursuing transplant (n = 20). Barriers to transplantation in low-resource setting begin in ESKD. LTFU resulted in withdrawal of care and was associated with low socioeconomic status. Among those who continued treatment, transplant rates were higher but medical challenges and negative attitudes towards transplant and organ donation occurred. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Young children display strong aversion toward antisocial individuals, but also feel responsible for joint activities and express a strong sense of group loyalty. This paper aims to understand how beneficial cooperation with an antisocial partner shapes preschoolers’ attitudes, preferences, and moral judgments concerning antisocial individuals. We argue that although young children display a strong aversion to antisocial characters, children may overcome this aversion when they stand to personally benefit. In Study 1a (N = 62), beneficial cooperation with an antisocial partner resulted in the children's later preference for the antisocial partner over the neutral partner. Study 1b (N = 91) replicated this effect with discrete measurement of liking (resource distribution) and showed that children rewarded more and punished less the antisocial partner in the beneficial cooperation setting. In Study 2, (N = 58), children's aversion to an antisocial in-group member decreased when the cooperation benefited other in-group members. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 62), when children passively observed the antisocial individual, personal benefits from the antisocial behavior did not change their negative attitude toward the antisocial individual. Overall, beneficial cooperation with the antisocial partner increased the children's liking and preference for the antisocial partner, but did not affect the children's moral judgments. Presented evidence suggests that by the age of 4, children develop a strong obligation to collaborate with partners who help them to acquire resources—even when these partners harm third parties, which children recognize as immoral. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Undocumented activism is on the rise. In response to the expansion of immigrant policing, detention, and deportation, immigrant rights organizers have increasingly deployed a longstanding approach to anti-deportation activism called “deportation defense campaigns” (DDCs). DDCs seek to disrupt the deportation regime by preventing or delaying individual deportations and providing immigrants a path to temporary or permanent legalization on a case-by-case basis. Yet in the process, campaigns must address questions about when and how to challenge dominant discourses and institutions while also achieving short-term goals. We examine DDCs through Deleuze and Guattari’s notion of the “minor” to examine how campaigns navigate difficult decisions about when and how to employ tactics that are typically characterized as either disruptive or conformist. Indeed, we argue that disruption and conformism should be understood not as a static evaluative framework, but as strategies that condition, and are conditioned by, the contexts in which undocumented activism unfolds. Using ethnographic methods, we examine two DDCs to show how the campaigns strategically navigated the cramped political spaces of undocumented organizing in the months following the new Trump administration’s surge of anti-immigrant policies. We find that DDCs simultaneously draw upon and subvert dominant forms of citizenship and belonging in order to pressure ICE to exercise legal discretion and stop deportation. We conclude that DDCs unfold under historically and geographically specific conditions that not only shape what counts as disruptive and conformist, but may call into question any easy division between the two altogether. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Meta-dehumanization, the perception your group has been given less than human qualities, contributes to a vicious cycle of outgroup dehumanization and hostility, such as hate crimes and support for discriminatory policies. Minimal research has investigated potential benefits of meta-humanization, or perceiving your group has been given dignified qualities. Across 7 studies (N = 1,261) in Canada and the United Kingdom, we focus on Muslim–non-Muslim relations and provide the first empirical evidence to suggest that (a) there is an indirect effect of meta-humanization through outgroup humanization that reduces prejudice and (b) that perceived high intergroup threat moderates the indirect effect of meta-humanization. Studies 1a and 1b reveal that humanization mediates the indirect effect of meta-humanization on prejudice. Studies 2a and 2b replicate these results as well as demonstrate that perceived threat moderates the indirect effect, and Study 2c extends this by testing the perspective of Muslims. Studies 3a and 3b further demonstrate an interaction between high threat and meta-humanization on prejudice and interest in intergroup contact. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the growing literature on meta-dehumanization, meta-humanization, and intergroup relations more broadly.

AB  - Objectives: This study tested whether the presence of a firearm changed the way people reacted to police among a British sample. Method: In an online study, participants were shown images of armed and unarmed police and rated them on a number of variables. Some participants were primed to think about terrorism, and some participants were exposed to more armed police than others. Results: Participants had more negative responses to police when they were armed. We found no effect of the terrorism prime on people’s reactions to images of armed police and no effect of exposure. Yet, unexpectedly, we found a negative effect of the terrorism prime on trust and legitimacy. Conclusions: In a country where police have never before been routinely armed, this research raises important questions about how armed police can retain the public’s support when they may no longer be considered ‘prototypical representatives’ of the British people. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the role of individuals’ media diets in contributing to the growing support for right-wing populist parties. Drawing on social identity theory and the notion of populism as political communication, this study argues that socio-economic status and tabloid news use explain support for right-wing candidates through heightened out-group hostility. Using survey data from the Austrian National Election Study (N = 1161), we present a process model in the structural equation modeling framework, and we compare the direct and indirect effects of attention to tabloid versus broadsheet news on the probability to vote for the Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs. Results show that the link between social status and support for right-wing populism is mediated by attention to tabloid news and anti-immigration attitudes. Implications for democratic norms are discussed in light of the overlap between news media and politicians in their use of populist narratives. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - To what extent does exposure to immigration condition the types of immigrants citizens are willing to admit? Extending the conjoint approach adopted by Hainmueller and Hopkins (Am J Pol Sci 59(3):529–548, 2015), this study investigates whether the admission preferences of French natives vary based on personal exposure to immigration, as proxied by local demographics and self-reported social contact. Methodologically, we propose and apply new methods to compare attribute salience across different subgroups of respondents. We find that although an inflow of immigrants into respondents’ municipalities has a limited influence on how French natives evaluate prospective immigrants, social contact with immigrants matters. Specifically, French natives who do not frequently interact with immigrants are significantly less favorable toward immigrants from non-western countries, and more favorable toward immigrants from western countries. In contrast, natives who report frequent social interactions with immigrants place less weight on nationality as a criterion for immigrant admission. Although scholars have noted an increasing consensus in immigration attitudes across developed democracies, our findings suggest that individual experiences with immigration condition preferences for immigration policy at the national level. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cross-ethnic friendships offer a unique opportunity for improving intergroup relations and reduce prejudice, yet ethnic segregation of friendship networks is often seen as a major obstacle to the integration of immigrant students in educational contexts. This article examines the role of perspective-taking abilities and prejudice towards low social class peers on the probability of cross-ethnic friendships in a sample of 242 students from five multicultural classrooms in Chile (Mage = 12.3; SD = 0.69, 45% girls). It was expected that students who reported high levels of perspective-taking abilities and low levels of prejudice towards low social class peers were more likely to form and maintain cross-ethnic friendships. Longitudinal network analysis (RSiena) was used to examine these hypotheses, confirming the role of both variables in fostering (and reducing) friendships among Chilean and immigrant adolescents. Results are discussed in light of an intersectional framework between social class and ethnicity. Implications for social-emotional interventions in multicultural educational contexts are also discussed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Americans are much more likely to be socially connected to copartisans, both in daily life and on social media. However, this observation does not necessarily mean that shared partisanship per se drives social tie formation, because partisanship is confounded with many other factors. Here, we test the causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in a field experiment on Twitter. We created bot accounts that self-identified as people who favored the Democratic or Republican party and that varied in the strength of that identification. We then randomly assigned 842 Twitter users to be followed by one of our accounts. Users were roughly three times more likely to reciprocally follow-back bots whose partisanship matched their own, and this was true regardless of the bot’s strength of identification. Interestingly, there was no partisan asymmetry in this preferential follow-back behavior: Democrats and Republicans alike were much more likely to reciprocate follows from copartisans. These results demonstrate a strong causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in an ecologically valid field setting and have important implications for political psychology, social media, and the politically polarized state of the American public. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - In the last few decades, South Africa has experienced destructive waves of anti-immigrant violence. Tackling this kind of hate crime requires co-ordinated action. Mobilizing such action would be easier if researchers, activists, and policymakers better understood public opinion on antixenophobia interventions. This article examines individual preferences for different types of interventions using nationally representative public opinion data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey. To avoid possible researcher bias, this study uses textual data from open-ended questions. Seven different antixenophobia strategies (ranging from anti-immigrant pogroms to public awareness campaigns) were identified. Support for these strategies was driven by the following: (a) lay attributions of responsibility; (b) social dominance orientation; (c) political trust; and (d) homophilious tendencies. These findings provide important insight into the general populace’s construals of violence and how these shape support for redress. This study can be used to design strategies to build public support for effective antixenophobia interventions. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - To explain the political clout of different social groups, traditional accounts typically focus on the group's size, resources, or commonality and intensity of its members' interests. We contend that a group's penumbra-the set of individuals who are personally familiar with people in that group-is another important explanatory factor that merits systematic analysis. To this end, we designed a panel study that allows us to learn about the characteristics of the penumbras of politically relevant groups such as gay people, the unemployed, or recent immigrants. Our study reveals major and systematic differences in the penumbras of various social groups, even ones of similar size. Moreover, we find evidence that entering a group's penumbra is associated with a change in attitude on group-related policy questions. Taken together, our findings suggest that penumbras are pertinent for understanding variation in the political standing of different groups in society. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Ethnic minority villages are a vital part of tourism in certain destinations, often attracting many domestic and international visitors to experience unique local cultures and authentic lifestyles. However, much of the relevant literature has not examined tourist motivations, perceptions, and attitudes regarding ethnic minority village tourism. This exploratory qualitative research analyzed user-generated blogs uploaded by people sharing their ethnic minority village experiences in Guizhou Province, China. ROST Content Mining6 software was employed to identify motivations, perceptions, and attitudes toward minority village tourism. The findings indicated that tourist experience included natural aesthetic, cultural aesthetic, service and interaction, and entertainment. The main motivation was to experience unique cultural activities. The strongest perceptions were of the local villagers, Miao and Dong family life, and tourism services and environments. Tourist attitudes were mostly positive. Suggestions for better satisfying tourist needs and improving experiences were derived from the data. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Anthropogenic climate change currently threatens existing systems of human societies, and psychology has a significant role in exploring and untangling the predictors of sustainable behaviors and environmental concern. The present research identifies several individual demographic factors (age, education, and political ideology) as well as various attitudinal and social factors, such as ecological worldview, social identity, and place attachment, and explores their relationship with pro-environmental concern and behavior. The results of this synthesis indicate that there are complex and dynamic associations between these demographic, attitudinal, and social factors, and environmental variables. Several relevant theoretical models are discussed (e.g., Value Belief Norm theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior), a summative model of behavioral predictors is introduced, and implications for community education and policy support are considered. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - Embracing sustainability in the 21st century entails developing environmental identity, so that attitudes towards energy sustainability result from the core values of one’s individual and social identity. This study aims to explore the shift in the formation of environmental identity and attitudes towards energy sustainability throughout the course of the two-year study period (2018–2020). A dataset of 8,677,961 tweets, Facebook posts and comments and 325,228 news articles was collected to carry out quantitative analysis of the distribution of the posts, likes, and comments. A correlation with media coverage of energy and green topics was sought to establish the impact of the media on public debate. A qualitative analysis of posts and tweets was carried out to establish dominant themes. The findings of the study reveal that both positive attitudes towards energy sustainability and environmental identity have been consolidated throughout the two-year study period. Social media users are not only increasingly interested in green issues but also produce more reactions towards posts related to sustainability topics. The results also suggest that sustainable values and green behavior are independent from the media coverage of current events and the perceived threat to one’s health from COVID-19. Social networking sites provide a context in which users not only reinforce their beliefs and values, but also mimic the behavior of other users, which leads to the formation of a social media identity bubble that reinforces shared identity—in this case, environmental identity. This study offers a multidisciplinary perspective on sustainable development that will be able to drive equitable energy security and environmental security. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - This article investigates the political legitimacy of the health care system and the effects of austerity on the population’s welfare, paying particular attention to Portugal, a country severely harmed by the economic crisis. Based on analysis of data collected from the European Social Survey on 14,988 individuals living in private households during the years between 2002 and 2018, the findings of this study aim to analyze the social and political perception of citizens on the state of health services in two distinctive periods—before and after the economic crisis, according to self-interest, ideological preferences, and institutional setup as predictors of the satisfaction with the health system. The results demonstrate a negative attitude towards the health system over the years, a consistent drop during the financial crisis period, and a rapid recovery afterward. The research also shows that healthcare evaluations depend on the perceived institutional effectiveness in the citizenry’s eyes. The more the citizens perceive the government as effective and trust-worthy, the more they are satisfied with the health system. Also, differences in healthcare evaluations among social groups were felt unequally: while vulnerable citizens were more affected by the Government’s plan of austerity measures for health reform, healthcare evaluations of better-off social groups— younger individuals, those with higher incomes, higher education, and better health status—did not decline. This study contributes to the academic debate on the effects of austerity on the population’s welfare attitudes and highlights the need to examine the different impacts of reforms introduced by the crisis on social groups. © 2021 by the author.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (< £16,000, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes.

AB  - COVID-19 is a challenge faced by individuals (personal vulnerability and behavior), requiring coordinated policy from national government. However, another critical layer—intergroup relations—frames many decisions about how resources and support should be allocated. Based on theories of self and social identity uncertainty, subjective group dynamics, leadership, and social cohesion, we argue that this intergroup layer has important implications for people’s perceptions of their own and others’ situation, political management of the pandemic, how people are influenced, and how they resolve identity uncertainty. In the face of the pandemic, initial national or global unity is prone to intergroup fractures and competition through which leaders can exploit uncertainties to gain short-term credibility, power, or influence for their own groups, feeding polarization and extremism. Thus, the social and psychological challenge is how to sustain the superordinate objective of surviving and recovering from the pandemic through mutual cross-group effort. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Employees may continue to work remotely for a substantial amount of time, even after the end of the pandemic. Our established theories of group processes and intergroup relations can help us understand these new ways of working and online group experiences. However, there are key differences in computer-mediated and face-to-face (FtF) groups. In this essay, I present some of the extant robust theories and findings from computer communication research to understand virtual working within online groups. These perspectives include that group processes develop over a longer period of time as compared to FtF, informal communication is neglected, computer-mediated groups have some advantages over FtF groups, sociomateriality is a useful theoretical lens, and dispersion affects group member cognitions about each other. I use my own lab’s work on entitativity as an example of how moving from FtF to online group research can deepen our understanding of both FtF and online groups. The essay concludes with recommendations for future research. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This article addresses the extent to which economic downturns influence the perception of immigrants as an economic threat and through which channels this occurs. Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances. Our database comprises all waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2017. The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions. Further mediation analyses show that objective economic conditions influence anti-immigrant attitudes primarily through individual perceptions of the country’s economic performance and that unemployment rates are of primary importance. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Objective: Disparities in U.S. breastfeeding rates persist among Black mothers according to birth country and between Black and White mothers, necessitating further investigation of modifiable mediating factors to inform interventions. This study seeks to examine the extent that social, maternal, infant factors and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) domains (attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms) mediate the association of maternal race/birth country and breastfeeding continuation. Methods: A national cohort of 2,050 mothers self-identifying as U.S.-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 689), foreign-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 139), and U.S.-born non-Hispanic White (n = 1,222) was analyzed. Using logistic regression, associations of race/birth country and any/exclusive breastfeeding at 2-6 months were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether social, maternal, and infant factors and TPB domains mediate these relationships. Results: 40.0% of U.S.-born Black, 82.2% of foreign-born Black, and 57.3% of U.S.-born White mothers reported any breastfeeding at 2-6 months. Compared with U.S.-born Black mothers, odds of any breastfeeding were sevenfold higher among foreign-born Black mothers (odds ratio [OR] = 7.04 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.80-10.31), which was explained partly by social/maternal/infant factors and TPB domains. Compared with U.S.-born White mothers, any breastfeeding was lower (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.73) among U.S.-born Black mothers and higher (OR = 3.81, 95% CI = 2.48-5.87) among foreign-born Black mothers; these differences were also mediated by the aforementioned factors. Conclusions: Among Black mothers in the United States, breastfeeding continuation varied substantially by birth country. Promotion of interventions targeting positive attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms may reduce disparities among Black and between Black and White mothers.

AB  - Intergroup relations theory posits that cross-group friendship reduces threat perceptions and negative emotions about outgroups. This has been argued to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on generalized trust. Yet, direct tests of this friendship-trust relation, especially including perceptions of threat and negative affect as mediators, have remained rare at the individual level. In this article, we bridge this research gap using representative data from eight European countries (Group-Focused Enmity). We employ structural equation modelling (SEM) to model mediated paths of cross-group friendship on generalized trust via perceptions of threat and negative affect. We find that both the total effect as well as the (mediated) total indirect effect of cross-group friendship on generalized trust are weak when compared with similar paths estimated for prejudice. © 2021 Achbari et al.

AB  - Background: Specifying the determinants of using health apps has been an important research topic for health scholars as health apps have proliferated during the past decade. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been revealed as a significant determinant of using health apps, but the cognitive mechanisms underlying the relationship between SES and health app use are unknown. Objective: This study aims to examine the cognitive mechanisms underlying the relationships between SES and use of health apps, applying the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IM). The model hypothesizes the indirect influences of SES on intentions to use health apps, which in turn predict actual use of health apps. The relationships between SES and intentions to use health apps were assumed to be mediated by proximal variables (attitudes, perceived behavioral control [PBC], injunctive norms, and descriptive norms). Methods: We conducted path analyses using data from a two-wave opt-in panel survey of Korean adults who knew about health apps. The number of respondents was 605 at baseline and 440 at follow-up. We compared our model with two alternative theoretical models based on modified IM to further clarify the roles of determinants of health app use. Results: Attitudes (β=.220, P<.001), PBC (β=.461, P<.001), and injunctive norms (β=.186, P<.001) were positively associated with intentions to use health apps, which, in turn, were positively related to actual use of health apps (β=.106, P=.03). Income was positively associated with intentions to use health apps, and this relationship was mediated by attitudes (B=0.012, 95% CI 0.001-0.023) and PBC (B=0.026, 95% CI 0.004-0.048). Education was positively associated with descriptive norms (β=.078, P=.03), but descriptive norms were not significantly related to intentions to use health apps. We also found that PBC interacted with attitudes (B=0.043, SE 0.022, P=.046) and jointly influenced intentions to use health apps, whereas the results did not support direct influences of education, income, and PBC on health app use. Conclusions: We found that PBC over using health apps may be the most important factor in predicting health app use. This suggests the necessity of designing and promoting health apps in a user-friendly way. Our findings also imply that socioeconomic inequalities in using health apps may be reduced by increasing positive attitudes toward, and boosting PBC over, health app use among individuals with low income. © Kwanho Kim, Chul-Joo Lee.

AB  - How people perceive outgroup prosocial behaviors is an important but under-researched aspect of intergroup relations. In three experiments conducted in two cultural contexts (Italy and Kosovo) and with two different populations (adolescents and adults; N = 586), we asked participants to imagine being offered help by an outgroup versus ingroup member. Participants attributed fewer prosocial motives to and were less willing to accept help from the outgroup (vs. ingroup) member. This was particularly true for highly prejudiced participants and when the outgroup was described negatively. Participants' perceptions of the outgroup helper's prosocial motives and expected quality of the interaction with the helper mediated the effect of helper's group membership on willingness to accept the help (Experiment 3). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A circular economy paradigm has recently emerged to combat environmental pollution and climate change around the world. In the fashion industry, circular fashion has been spotlighted as an environmentally friendly approach to fashion products. The purpose of this study was to investigate consumers’ value and risk perceptions, product attitudes, and behavior intentions toward circular fashion consumption. Specifically, this study focuses on three types of circular fashion products from textile waste: reused clothing, upcycled clothing, and recycled clothing. The moderating role of individualism was also explored. Survey data from 850 consumers in their 20s and 30s in Korea were collected to test our hypotheses. The results showed the influence of emotional value was the greatest, while economic risk and performance risk did not affect product attitudes. A moderating effect of individualism was found in the paths between perception dimension and product attitudes and between product attitudes and behavior intention. These findings can help retailers and marketers create more tailored retailing and promotional strategies. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective To evaluate how public perceptions and trust in government communications affected the adoption of protective behaviour in Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods We launched our community-based cohort to assess public perceptions of infectious disease outbreaks in mid-2019. After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Singapore on 23 January, we launched a series of seven COVID-19 surveys to both existing and regularly enrolled new participants every 2 weeks. As well as sociodemographic properties of the participants, we recorded changing responses to judge awareness of the situation, trust in various information sources and perceived risk. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate associations with perceptions of risk and self-reported adopted frequencies of protective behaviour. Findings Our cohort of 633 participants provided 2857 unique responses during the seven COVID-19 surveys. Most agreed or strongly agreed that information from official government sources (99.1%; 528/533) and Singapore-based news agencies (97.9%; 522/533) was trustworthy. Trust in government communication was significantly associated with higher perceived threat (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6–3.0), but inversely associated with perceived risk of infection (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.8) or risk of death if infected (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4–0.9). Trust in government communication was also associated with a greater likelihood of adopting protective behaviour. Conclusion Our findings show that trust is a vital commodity when managing an evolving outbreak. Our repeated surveys provided real-time feedback, allowing an improved understanding of the interplay between perceptions, trust and behaviour. © 2021, World Health Organization. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given negative social identity, different perceptions of the structure of an intergroup relation (i.e., stability, legitimacy, permeability) should be related to different identity-management strategies (i.e., social competition, social creativity, or individual mobility) depending on group identification. This is among the basic tenets of social identity theory (SIT). There is surprisingly little empirical support for these postulates in the context of one of the most central group identities: gender. Using a sample of women in leadership positions in Spain (N = 649), we tested relations between structural perceptions and identity-management strategies in a pilot study. Structural equation modeling yielded empirical support regarding social competition, but little for social creativity or individual mobility. Identity-management strategies were related to one organizational outcome (i.e., identification with the organization). The preregistered main study is intended to replicate and extend these findings using a different sample while improving several of the measures used. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Racial attitudes have long been studied for their salience to inter-group relations and the insight they provide into the nature of ethno-racial hierarchies. While research on racial attitudes among Latinos, now the largest minority group in the United States, has grown in recent decades, critical gaps remain. As such, this paper explores Latino immigrants’ attitudes toward Whites, Blacks, and other Latinos across multiple dimensions, including perceived affluence, intelligence, cultural behaviors, and receptivity to contact. We examine cross-group and cross-dimension variation in attitudes in order to evaluate key theories in the literature on racial attitudes, including the effects of socio-demographic factors, social contact, perceived threat, and forms of insecurity. Overall, Latino attitudes do not neatly subscribe to White superiority across dimensions, as they perceive differences in intelligence to be more modest than those in affluence, and rate their own cultural behaviors above those of Whites. Increased contact is associated with more positive views toward Blacks, but more negative views toward Whites and to a lesser extent, other Latinos. Perceived threat results in lower evaluations of all groups, whereas greater insecurity results in negative attitudes toward Whites and Blacks, but appears to push Latinos closer to their own group. Overall, results suggest that among immigrant Latinos, greater integration and social contact reduce White supremacy, rather than simply improving attitudes towards all out-groups, but that the softening of anti-Black prejudice is undermined by perceived vulnerability to crime and anti-immigrant forces. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming more prominent in the tourism industry. Nowadays, consumers are faced with multiple options involving both human and robot interactions. A series of experimental studies were implemented. Four experiments demonstrated that consumers had a more positive attitude toward robot-staffed (vs. human-staffed) hotels when COVID-19 was salient. The results were different from previous studies, which were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the moderating role of perceived threat in consumers’ preference for robot-staffed hotels was significant, the respondents’ preference was attributed to the global health crisis. This research provides a number of theoretical and managerial implications by improving the understanding of technology acceptance during a health crisis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Dengue is linked with climate change in tropical and sub-tropical countries including the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Laos) and Thailand. Knowledge about these issues and preventive measures can affect the incidence and outbreak risk of dengue. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among urban and rural communities and government officials about climate change and dengue in Laos and Thailand. Methods: A cross-sectional KAP survey about climate change and dengue were conducted in 360 households in Laos (180 urban and 180 rural), 359 households in Thailand (179 urban and 180 rural), and 20 government officials (10 in each country) using structured questionnaires. Data analysis was undertaken using descriptive methods, principal component analysis (PCA), Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (as appropriate), and logistic regression. Results: Significant differences among the selected communities in both countries were found in terms of household participant's age, level of education, socioeconomic status, attitude level of climate change and KAP level of dengue (P < 0.05; 95% CI). Overall, participants' KAP about climate change and dengue were low except the attitude level for dengue in both countries. The level of awareness among government officials regarding the climatic relationship with dengue was also low. In Lao households, participants’ knowledge about climate change and dengue was significantly associated with the level of education and socioeconomic status (SES) (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change and dengue were associated with educational level and internet use (P < 0.05). Householders' climate change related practices were associated with SES (P < 0.01) and dengue related practices were associated with educational level, SES, previous dengue experience and internet use (P < 0.01). In Thailand, participants' knowledge about climate change was associated with the level of education and SES (P < 0.01). Their attitudes towards climate change were associated with residence status (urban/rural) and internet use (P < 0.05); climate change related practices were associated with educational level and SES (P < 0.05). Dengue related knowledge of participants was associated with SES and previous dengue experience (P < 0.05); participants’ dengue related attitudes and practices were associated with educational level (P < 0.01). Conclusion: The findings call for urgently needed integrated awareness programs to increase KAP levels regarding climate change adaptation, mitigation and dengue prevention to improve the health and welfare of people in these two countries, and similar dengue-endemic countries. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Threat theory argues that states toughen criminal laws to repress the competitive power of large minority groups. Yet, research on threat suffers from a poor understanding of why minority group size contributes to social control and a lack of evidence on whether criminal law is uniquely responsive to the political interests of majority racial groups at all. By compiling a unique state-level dataset on 230 sentencing policy changes during mass incarceration and using data from 257,362 responses to 79 national surveys to construct new state-level measures of racial differences in punitive policy support, I evaluate whether criminal sentencing law is uniquely responsive to white public policy interests. Pooled event history models and mediation analyses support three primary conclusions: (1) states adopted new sentencing policies as a nonlinear response to minority group size, (2) sentencing policies were adopted in response to white public, but not black public, support for punitive crime policy, and (3) minority group size and race-specific homicide victimization both indirectly affect sentencing policy by increasing white public punitive policy support. These findings support key theoretical propositions for the threat explanation of legal change and identify white public policy opinion as a mechanism linking minority group size to variation in criminal law. © American Sociological Association 2020.

AB  - Pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) is known to reflect people's social preferences, time preferences and risk preferences. Previous research has tended to consider these in isolation, which means they may proxy for omitted ones, leading to biased estimates. Moreover, it has not considered ambiguity preferences, which for some PEBs is conceptually more relevant than risk preferences. Using a survey module from the Global Preference Survey (GPS), we investigate the role of a large range of preferences for PEB in a sample of 900 middle class households in Lima, Peru. The PEBs we consider are habitually saving energy, avoiding the use of plastics, and limiting expenditures on electricity. We find that social preferences matter mainly for saving-energy behaviour; time, risk and ambiguity preferences matter mainly for the consumption of plastics; and time and ambiguity preferences matter for expenditures on electricity. The insight that particular preferences matter for particular PEBs has important policy implications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research advances a social identity approach to leadership through a meta-analysis examining four novel hypotheses that clarify the nature and impact of leader group prototypicality (the extent to which a leader is perceived to embody shared social identity). A random-effects meta-analysis (k = 128, N = 32,834) reveals a moderate-to-large effect of prototypicality that holds across evaluative and behavioral outcomes. The effect is stronger (a) when prototypicality is conceptualized as the ideal-type rather than the average group member, (b) for stronger prototypes (indexed by group longevity), and (c) for group members in formal rather than nonformal leadership roles. The effect is not contingent on group prototypicality entailing differentiation from other (out)groups. Additionally, results provide meta-analytic evidence of widely examined key factors: follower group identification (which enhances the relationship) and leader group-serving behavior (which attenuates the relationship). Building on these findings, we outline the implications for the next wave of theoretical and empirical work. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Most citizens agree that legislators should reflect their constituencies' stances. Yet constituents rarely speak in a single voice. Instead, constituents often vary not only in their policy preferences, but also in the degree to which a given policy impacts their lives. Politicians thus at times pursue targeted representation, offering increased input to especially affected groups. As efforts to address anti-Black police misconduct make clear, such measures can protect vulnerable minority groups—but they may also be perceived to sideline the less-affected majority. We fielded two national survey experiments to investigate how Americans respond when legislators give more attention to some citizens than others. Results suggest that members of targeted groups react more positively on average than nonmembers and that reactions among nonmembers are strongly driven by racial resentment. The impact of racial resentment is largely unaffected by the race and partisanship of the politician proposing the measure, but it is exacerbated in cases of a clear preference conflict between the African American community and the broader constituency. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Addressing climate change requires international effort from both governments and the public. Climate change concern is a crucial variable influencing public support for measures to address climate change. Combining country-level data with data from the Pew Research Center Spring 2015 Global Attitudes Survey, we test whether perceived threats from climate change influence climate change concern. We distinguish between personal threat and planetary threat and we find that both threats have substantive effects on climate change concern, with personal threat exerting a greater influence on climate change concern than planetary threat. The effects of both types of threats are also moderated by Gross Domestic Product per capita, such that threats have stronger effects on climate change concern in high-income countries than in low-income countries. Our findings contribute to the existing literature and open up new debates concerning the role of threats in climate change concern and have implications for climate change communication. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Intermarriage is transforming Africa’s ethnic landscape. In several countries on the continent more than a fifth of all marriages now cut across ethnic lines. As a result, there is a growing population of multiethnic citizens who descend from diverse family lineages. The growth of Africa’s mixed population has the potential to affect politics in a variety of potentially far-reaching ways. In this article, we focus on one possible implication by examining the electoral preferences of multiethnic voters in contexts where ethnic bloc voting is commonplace. Drawing on survey data from Malawi and Kenya, we find that mixed individuals are less likely to support the party associated with their stated ethnic group, relative to mono-ethnics. We outline several possible explanations related to identity measurement, the link between identities and preferences, and social networks. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer continues to be a leading cancer among women in India. Despite availability of various screening techniques, majority of Indian women remain unscreened for cancer cervix. The increasing incidence could be attributed to the lack of awareness regarding cervical cancer screening and paucity of organized screening facilities in the country. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards cervical cancer screening among tribal women of coastal Karnataka, southern India. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 1140 women aged 20–65 years from three tribes. Information on their KAP towards cervical cancer screening was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results: Mean age of the participants was 39.8 ± 10.1 years. Although 82.9% of the participants reported to have heard of cervical cancer, 51% were aware that the disease could be prevented, and only 2.3% knew that it can be detected at an early stage. Over 75% of the participants did not have adequate knowledge regarding cervical cancer. However, majority of them (99.9%) had a favourable attitude towards cervical cancer screening. None of them had undergone cervical cancer screening prior to the study. The knowledge scores were significantly associated with age group, marital status, education level, socioeconomic status and tribal community of the participants (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Overall knowledge regarding cervical cancer among the surveyed women was poor, though they exhibited a positive attitude. This calls for a sustained health education and screening program to create awareness and improve the uptake of cervical cancer screening among these women. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - South Korea is slowly but steadily becoming a country of immigrants. In 1998, there were barely 300,000 foreign residents in South Korea. As of 2018, there were more than 2.3 million. The immigrant population has yet to reach 5% of the total population, but it is predicted to rise significantly in the years to come. Despite the increase in newcomers, it is not well understood who native South Koreans prefer as immigrants and why. Are immigrant attitudes motivated by co-ethnic solidarity, or are they primarily based on economic and sociotropic concerns? To isolate attitudes on these crucial questions, this research uses a conjoint experiment that simultaneously tests the influence of seven immigrant attributes in generating support for admission. Our results show that broad sociotropic concerns largely drive attitudes towards immigrants in South Korea, but an immigrant’s origin also matters. Prospective newcomers from culturally similar and higher-status countries who can speak Korean and have clear plans to work are most preferred. The research findings will be relevant to the comparative study of immigration attitudes, as well as to researchers interested in the specifics of the South Korean case. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This research investigates the effectiveness of messaging strategies to reduce negative tourist stereotyping by residents given the detrimental effects of stereotyping on host–tourist relations. Study 1 examines the effects of two strategies: “prevalence of stereotyping message” (PSM) and “prevalence of counter-stereotyping message” (PCSM), compared to a control group via a between-subjects experimental design. Study 2 investigates whether eliciting a common identity between residents and tourists could further improve these strategies via a 2 (stereotype reduction: PSM vs. PCSM) × 2 (identity: tourists as residents vs. residents as tourists) between-subjects experimental design. Study 3 examines the boundary conditions of these strategies with a group of nonlocal, subgroup residents. The findings show that tourist stereotypes are malleable, and stereotype reduction efforts through communication messages could reduce biases against tourists by residents. This research contributes by connecting concepts on stereotype reduction, social norms, and social identity with tourism stereotype research. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Communities prosper when they are able to appropriate the wealth they produce and their institutions make peoples’ lives meaningful. They wither when the institutions that permit this weaken or vanish. Sacrifice zones — abandoned, economically shattered places, with growing social and health problems — are spreading in historically white rural areas and small towns across the United States. Rural decline, rooted in economic restructuring and financialization, causes severe stress, exacerbates racial resentment, and creates a breeding ground for regressive authoritarian politics. A multidimensional approach must analytically connect long-term and recent trends affecting economy and livelihoods, institutions, health, and community life. The “racial resentment” and “economic distress” explanations for authoritarian populism are inextricably connected. Since the 1980s, and in intensified form after the 2008 financial crisis, capital has systematically undermined the institutions — mutually-owned banks, credit unions, mom-and-pop businesses, family farms — that fostered reinvestment of locally-produced wealth, especially but not only in rural areas. While many Trump voters were affluent suburbanites, another important sector of supporters consists of downwardly mobile inhabitants of zones where financialization and austerity destroyed the institutions that earlier allowed people to appropriate the wealth that they produced and where the social safety net, always fragile, is increasingly in tatters. The United States now has a poor and near-poor majority. Scholars and the media have underestimated the human toll of this crisis and the interconnectedness of the multiple processes of social decomposition affecting rural zones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The social construction of target populations has emerged as an influential framework for understanding the public policy process. In particular, target populations have been shown to shape the allocation of benefits and burdens by political elites. However, existing studies focus on the elite level, which overlooks whether public preferences are aligned with the allocation of policy benefits and burdens by political elites. Moreover, many studies treat social constructions as homogenous, which this paper calls into question. Using a nation-wide survey experiment, I investigate variation in public support for affirmative action policies with randomly assigned target populations. The findings indicate that the public formulates policy preferences on the basis of perceived deservingness of target groups similar to political elites. In addition, the findings uncover heterogeneity in the effect of targeting on public opinion based on ideology and racial/ethnic group identity. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization

AB  - Drawing on the role of teachers for peer ecologies, we investigated whether students favored ethnically homogenous over ethnically diverse relationships, depending on classroom diversity and perceived teacher care. We specifically studied students' intra- and interethnic relationships in classrooms with different ethnic compositions, accounting for homogeneous subgroups forming on the basis of ethnicity and gender diversity (i.e., ethnic-demographic faultlines). Based on multilevel social network analyses of dyadic networks between 1299 early adolescents in 70 German fourth grade classrooms, the results indicated strong ethnic homophily, particularly driven by German students who favored ethnically homogenous dyads over mixed dyads. As anticipated, the results showed that there was more in-group bias if perceived teacher care was low rather than high. Moreover, stronger faultlines were associated with stronger in-group bias; however, this relation was moderated by teacher care: If students perceived high teacher care, they showed a higher preference for mixed-ethnic dyads, even in classrooms with strong faultlines. These findings highlight the central role of teachers as agents of positive diversity management and the need to consider contextual classroom factors other than ethnic diversity when investigating intergroup relations in schools. © Copyright © 2021 Grütter, Meyer, Philipp, Stegmann and van Dick.

AB  - PURPOSE: 1. To assess the oral health status and health behaviour of 5- to 6-year-oldchildren and the influence of socio-behavioural factors on oral health among children, and 2. evaluate dental knowledge and attitudes related to oral health promotion of children among mothers and schoolteachers in Palestine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2017, and recruited samples of children (n = 3939, 53.8% boys, 44.8% girls) from 61 primary schools, their mothers and schoolteachers (n = 53). Participants were selected randomly by multistage stratified cluster sampling. Calibrated dentists performed oral examinations of 5- to 6-year-old schoolchildren based on WHO criteria. Mothers and teachers completed WHO self-administrated questionnaires to assess children's oral health behaviour, as well as their knowledge and attitudes towards children's dental care. RESULTS: Caries prevalence of primary teeth was 83.4% and caries experience was high (dmf-s = 11.17). One-fourth of children suffered from pain or discomfort from teeth, and 57.7% of children had seen a dentist within the past 12 months, frequently due to pain or problems. Consumption of sugars was frequent and only 19.7% brushed their teeth every day. Neglect of dental visits, infrequent toothbrushing, being a child from families of urban settings and high socioeconomic status were greatly affected by caries. Mothers and schoolteachers had most﻿ly positive attitudes towards school-based oral health care. However, the availability of dental health education materials was extremely low. CONCLUSION: The establishment of school-based oral health programmes, including effective use of toothpaste containing fluoride for caries prevention, is greatly needed to improve the oral health of Palestinian children. The introduction of fluoridated school milk is highly recommended. The establishement of school programmes should encompass active involvement of schoolteachers and mothers to promote the development of healthy lifestyles and sustainable oral health behaviours among schoolchildren. Provision of materials for health education by schoolteachers and mothers is urgent﻿ly needed.

AB  - This paper establishes economic complexity as a powerful predictor of environmental attitudes. While the economic complexity index (ECI) has been associated with a series of economic outcomes, yet there has not been a link in the literature between ECI and environmental attitudes. This research pushes forward the hypothesis that economic complexity shapes cultural values and beliefs. The research method used is a multilevel empirical analysis that associates aggregate values of the ECI, at the country level, with individual responses related to attitudes towards the environment. Our findings suggest that a marginal increase of the ECI, increases by 0.191 the probability to be a member of environmental organisations and an increase by 0.259 in the probability to engage in voluntary work for the environment. To further reinforce our findings by ensuring identification we replicate the benchmark analysis using as a proxy of a country’s level of economic complexity, the average ECI of the neighbouring countries (weighted by population and/or volume of trade). With a similar intention, i.e., to mitigate endogeneity concerns as well as to further frame our findings as “the cultural implications of ECI” we replicate our analysis with a sample of second generation immigrants. The immigrant analysis, suggests that the level of economic complexity of the parents’ country of origin, has a long-lasting effect on second generation immigrants’ attitudes related to the environment. Because humankind’s attitudes and actions are of key importance for a sustainable future, a better understanding as to what drives environmental attitudes appears critical both for researchers and policy makers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In a “colourblind” Europe, where race talk is taboo, explicit racial resentment towards newcomers is confined to the margins. Nonetheless, a racialized understanding of immigration and asylum persists, as evidenced in the less policed realm of iconographic representation. An analysis of the association between keyword-retrieved discursive frames and 1,500 photographs in Google Image search results from the years starting with the “migrant crisis” of 2015 reveals different regimes of representation and suggests that concepts of illegality and threat are embodied in images as race. Despite the overlapping hierarchies of origins found in today’s racializing discourses, the pillars of old European racial taxonomies emerge as the prevalent codes of racialized difference in pictorial representation of a besieged Europe. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Psychological research and theory focused on distinct racialization and racial identity experiences of Asian Americans are limited. Our article proposes a new measure of ideological values related to Asian American racial identity that draws on Asian Critical Race Theory and Asian Americanist perspectives that emphasize the unique history of oppression, resilience, and resistance among Asians in America. Across three studies with a combined sample of 860 Asian American college students, we created and confirmed the bifactor structure and fit of the 13-item measure of Asian American Racial Identity Ideological Values (AARIIV), with three subscales. Asian American Unity is a cultural response to the discourse on who is included in the category “Asian American” across intersections of social positionalities. Interracial Solidarity is a cultural response to the shared experiences of discrimination and exploitation among all racial minority groups. Transnational Critical Consciousness is a cultural response to Asians in the United States and Asians abroad who share overlapping racialization and discrimination experiences due to white supremacy and imperialism. The three-subscale structure of the AARIIV was supported by a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Evidence of convergent validity was supported as it positively correlated with awareness of racism, critical reflection, critical action, racial centrality, ethnic pride, and ethnic engagement; and negatively correlated with internalization of the model minority myth and colorblind racial attitudes. Evidence of incremental validity was supported as AARIIV predicted colorblind racial attitudes and critical consciousness above and beyond broad-ranging measures of racial identity and ethnic identity. © 2021.

AB  - Tattoo is a growing phenomenon among people of all ages, cultures and ethnic groups. With this study, we want to evaluate the mindset and opinion of medical students regarding tattoos, their awareness regarding the pros and cons, and proper guidelines of the procedure of getting inked and permanent removal of tattoo, whether or not do they apply their medical knowledge in real life when they go to get a tattoo, and do they promote and follow proper hygiene technique. Data was collected from the undergraduate medical students by using a pre-validated, self-administered questionnaire. The maximum study participants belong to the age group of 18-20 yrs i.e. 116 (58%), with female preponderance of 134 (67%). Out of 200, 35 (17.5%) participants have tattoos out of which 12 (34.28%) are males and 23 (65.71%) are females.29 out of 35 (82.85%) made sure that the tattoo parlor had a license prior to getting a tattoo, 6 (17.14%) participants did not do the same. Coming to the 165 (82.5%) participants who do not have a tattoo yet, 48 (29.09%) are planning on getting a tattoo in the future and 51 (30.9%) stated that they might think about it. The main reasons for not getting a tattoo were permanency (18.25%), chances of HIV/Hepatitis B/other infections (15.21%), and the use of toxic dyes(14.07%).When all the participants were asked about their opinions regarding tattoos and people with tattoos, even though a vast majority of 106 (53%) said it made no difference to them, only 49 (24.50%) had a positive attitude towards it, while 41 (20.50%) had mixed feelings and 4 (2%) had a negative prospective. © 2021 South India Medico-Legal Association.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19, a pandemic declared on March 11th, 2020, makes it crucial for the whole world to control and ensure safety measures to control such infections in the future. Fear, worry, and panic remain widespread, especially among healthcare workers. We aimed to compare the knowledge, attitude, anxiety, and behaviours of medical and non-medical students towards vaccination against COVID-19. Material and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study for one month on the MBBS/BDS and undergraduate nonmedical students through an online questionnaire which consisted of a multiple choice KAP questionnaire consisting of four sections (i.e., socio-demographic details, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior). Multiple linear regression was performed to determine the variables predicting knowledge and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Results: Vaccine hesitancy was detected in 17% of Undergraduate Medical Students, while the same was noted in 45% of non-medical students. 48.7% of medical students knew about different vaccines available in India for COVID-19 viz a viz the same in non-medical students was 49.5%. The majority of the students (35.8% medical and 48.6% non-medical) considered Covishield the best currently available vaccine in India. The majority of the students (Medical 86.5% and non-medical 75.2%) thought that the COVID-19 vaccine could reduce the spread of the disease in the community. In the multiple regression model, better socioeconomic status, holding nuclear families, and having a history of essential vaccinations uptake were linked with knowledge, while attitudes were substantially associated with being female and having previous history of vital vaccines uptake.Conclusion: The results showed that medical students had sufficient knowledge, an optimistic attitude, and moderate levels of concern towards COVID-19. Vaccine hesitancy was much less among medical when compared to non¬medical students. Expanding knowledge and regulatory oversight of vaccine research and the public release of safety data may lessen vaccine reluctance among students. © 2021, Arabian Gulf University.

AB  - The current research examined the role of values in guiding people’s responses to COVID-19. Results from an international study involving 115 countries (N = 61,490) suggest that health and economic threats of COVID-19 evoke different values, with implications for controlling and coping with the pandemic. Specifically, health threats predicted prioritization of communal values related to caring for others and belonging, whereas economic threats predicted prioritization of agentic values focused on competition and achievement. Concurrently and over time, prioritizing communal values over agentic values was associated with enactment of prevention behaviors that reduce virus transmission, motivations to help others suffering from the pandemic, and positive attitudes toward outgroup members. These results, which were generally consistent across individual and national levels of analysis, suggest that COVID-19 threats may indirectly shape important responses to the pandemic through their influence on people’s prioritization of communion and agency. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Does exposure to cyberattacks influence public support for intrusive cybersecurity policies? How do perceptions of cyber threats mediate this relationship? While past research has demonstrated how exposure to cyberattacks affects political attitudes, the mediating role played by threat perception has been overlooked. This study employs a controlled randomized survey experiment design to test the effect of exposure to lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks on support for different types of cybersecurity policies. One thousand twenty-two Israeli participants are exposed to scripted and simulated television reports of lethal or nonlethal cyberattacks against national infrastructure. Findings suggest that exposure to cyberattacks leads to greater support for stringent cybersecurity regulations, through a mechanism of threat perception. Results also indicate that different types of exposure relate to heightened support for different types of regulatory policies. People exposed to lethal cyberattacks tend to support cybersecurity policies that compel the government to alert citizens about cyberattacks. People who were exposed to nonlethal attacks, on the other hand, tend to support oversight policies at higher levels. More broadly, our research suggests that peoples' willingness to accept government cybersecurity policies that limit personal civil liberties and privacy depends on the type of cyberattacks to which they were exposed and the perceptions associated with such exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - A current focal point of right-wing populist (RWP) parties across Western societies has been anti-environmentalism and anti-feminism, entangled with their dominant anti-migrant agenda. This clustering of positions overlaps with the conceptual GAL-TAN (Green, Alternative, Liberalist–Traditional, Authoritarian, Nationalist) distinction in voter studies. Still, numerous voters might transcend this distinction, for instance adhering to femonationalism. By taking a feminist ground-up approach, we reveal how nativist, anti-feminist, and anti-environmentalist attitudes do (or do not) cluster across Western Europe. Our results show that approximately 30% of voters deviate from the GAL-TAN logic, with considerable clusters of citizens combining strong nativism with support for gender equality or moderate nativism with anti-feminism. Further, we estimate the support for RWP parties and show that nativism is core to supporting RWP elites, and anti-environmentalism can provide an additional vote bonus. However, our analysis reveals that the (anti-)feminist and nativist elements of people’s political ideology entail more complex entanglements: both anti-feminist nativist voters and femonationalist voters gravitate to RWP parties. These results imply that feminist quantitative studies are needed to lay bare the average-defying minority groups that can be mobilised to support RWP parties. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Most analysis of democratic backsliding focuses on the elite or party level. This article takes a bottom-up approach. In Turkey, popular support for a strong, undemocratic leader developed independently of Erdoğan and the AKP, but later consolidated behind the party. Analysis of longitudinal public opinion data reveals that the 2000– 2001 economic crisis undermined the democratic consensus, but that economic prosperity–far from restoring faith in democracy–reinforced support for a strongman leader as an alternative to liberal democracy among populations that benefited the most economically: the middle class and economic elites. Additionally, individuals who identify strongly with politically predominant social groups tend to support undemocratic leaders. This analysis improves our understanding of mass-levelsupport for authoritarian leaders in democracies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Migrant women born in Somalia often have poorer pregnancy outcomes. Access to care around pregnancy is vital to improve outcomes. The views and experiences of Somali migrant women accessing maternity care in the UK have not been extensively explored. This study therefore explores and describes these with regard to accessing maternity care in the UK, with the hope of gaining a better understanding of perceptions and factors that influence their access to care around pregnancy. METHODS A qualitative approach was used to investigate the views and experiences of women born in Somalia who had migrated to Leicester. Data collected were transcribed and analyzed using a constant comparison method. The software package Nvivo 10 was used to organize themes, and verbatim quotes were used to support their interpretation. RESULTS Main finings included: 1) positive attitudes of community midwives and availability lead to positive and meaningful experiences; 2) language difficulties and ineffective communication are barriers to effective access; 3) lack of cultural awareness and preconceived ideas by some hospital caregivers makes them unsupportive and insensitive; 4) need for continuity of care and the provision of resources are needed to build important trusting relationships with care providers; and 5) personal, community and religious factors impact access to care. CONCLUSIONS The results highlight a number of important potential barriers to accessing care around pregnancy for migrant women born in Somalia and how these could be addressed to improve pregnancy outcomes. © 2021.

AB  - The study investigates the satisfaction of religious minorities in Pakistan subject to government policies and attitudes of the Muslim majority. A cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from 120 respondents living in rural areas in Pakistan. Descriptive statistics and the Pearson correlation coefficient were used to measure the relatedness of essential factors of freedom of expression, opportunity in government services, security of unprotected assembly, prejudice in relationship with Muslims and welcomeness in Muslim neighbourhoods. Yeh's Index of Satisfaction was used to measure the satisfaction level of religious minorities with government policies and attitudes of the Muslim majority. The study findings revealed that religious minorities are least satisfied with their citizenship rights in Pakistan, which poses various questions to government policies and legislation. Further, they were also least satisfied with the attitudes of the Muslim majority with whom they must interact in their everyday life. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2022

AB  - In diverse societies, peaceful intergroup relationships are necessary. Using a minimal groups paradigm, we randomly assigned 188 ethnically diverse U.S. 4 and 5-year-olds to groups with different norms about intergroup relationships. Some were given positive norms (e.g., their ingroup talks, shares, and plays with the outgroup), others were given negative norms (e.g., their ingroup does not talk, share, or play with the outgroup), and others were given no norms. Children then participated in a live and unexpected intergroup interaction. Broadly, the descriptive norms affected children’s interactions with the outgroup member. For example, those given positive norms, compared to no norms, were more likely to communicate, share, and show positive affect with the outgroup member. Implications for intergroup conflict, particularly from a developmental perspective, are discussed. © 2021. American Psychological Association

AB  - AIDS appeared in the Slovenian and Yugoslav territory in the mid-1980s, when Yugoslavia faced an economic crisis and increasing political discord, while at the same time the Slovenian society was characterised by accelerated democratisation and liberalisation. This article addresses the question of how the Slovenian – and to some extent the Yugoslav – politics, experts and public reacted to the arrival of AIDS. Drawing on the periodical press and supplementary archival sources, the article outlines the measures adopted by the state in the struggle against AIDS. It also highlights the disagreements that emerged among Yugoslav experts and between federal and republican authorities in dealing with the new disease. In this paper, the response to AIDS serves as a prism for examining the capacity of Slovenian and Yugoslav authorities to deal with complex socio-medical issues, the functioning of the Slovenian and Yugoslav medical profession, and the state of the Slovenian media. It also provides insight into public attitudes towards republican-federal antagonisms and the stigma of disease, thus revealing the state of socio-political values in the Slovenian and Yugoslav territory during the turbulent 1980s. © 2021 Institute of Contemporary History.

AB  - Since terrorism has an undeniable psychological component; how citizens think about counterterrorism offers important implications for determining successful state responses. This research note examines empirical linkages between foreign policy preferences and support for eight counterterrorism measures, especially military-focused approaches associated with the “war model” of counterterrorism. Findings derived from the Chicago Council Survey of American Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy indicate that traditional foreign policy orientations, especially internationalist and militarist postures, condition respondent counterterrorism preferences in important ways beyond ideology and partisan identification. Moreover, threat perceptions consistently predict respondent support for both violent and restrictive counterterrorism measures.

AB  - As global efforts to address COVID-19 become more urgent, the public discourse on attitudes towards immigrants has also become more polarized. In such a heightened social and political context, we study the impact of intergroup contact in political jurisdictions with different shares of minority populations. Drawing on data from the Australian Election Study and the Census, we find that less intergroup contact with neighbours from minority birthplace, language and citizenship backgrounds is correlated with higher anti-immigrant sentiments. These results have significant implications for immigrant-receiving countries with existing legislation and policies that direct immigrants to move to areas of lower population density, lower presence of immigrants, and less previous exposure to international migration. The evidence presented in this study suggests that without sufficient political and policy sensitization to the issues for immigrants living in these areas, there could be detrimental social and political impacts to both immigrants and society more generally. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Relations between Brussels and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) worsened during and after the 2015 migration crisis. In order to see to what extent CEE citizens contributed to and/or resonated with this new state of affairs, this paper investigates public opinion before the migration crisis in seven CEE EU Member States. We inquire whether the main issues of the rift (CEE political elites’ opposition to following EU decisions and immigration and their emphasis on sovereignism, nationalism, Christian Europe and historical traumas) could also be traced to public stances towards these issues before the migration crisis. We used the ISSP National Identity module conducted in 2013 and 2014 in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Croatia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovenia. The results show that opposition to EU supranationalism was not linked to ethnic nationalism and religious identity (except in Hungary). Contrary to political elites, who emphasised the cultural threat posed by migration, public opinion was more concerned with the economic threat. Moreover, the perception of cultural threat was not linked to opposing EU supranationalism in any of the countries. However, particularly support for sovereignism (in almost all the countries), but also pride in national history (in some countries) correlated negatively with support for EU supranationalism. The results suggest that political elites can bypass public opinion to construct an anti-EU climate, however not out of thin air. The conditions for such a process were present in Hungary with its emerging transnational cleavage, which shows the importance of cleavages in studying Euroscepticism. © 2021, Croatian Sociological Association.

AB  - Why did the Truman administration fail to pursue rapprochement with the Chinese Communists in early 1949? Available accounts focus on the existence of deep ideological differences—around the liberal/communist divide—between Chinese Communists and American leaders, which contributed to high levels of threat perception and inhibited effective communication between the two sides. Other accounts highlight the Truman administration need to secure public support and domestic mobilisation of resources, which was instrumental to the approval of the European Recovery Program (ERP), the Military Assistance Program (MAP), and NATO. By using recently declassified and underexploited sources, this article offers an alternative explanation: Truman’s nationalist beliefs and his cognitive image of China as a ‘colony’ led the president to shift economic and military support from the Kuomintang to local warlords in Western China to encourage covert operations against the CCP since late 1948. These findings confirm that pre-existing cognitive perceptions and stereotypes played a key role in shaping Sino-American relations in the early Cold War, and they might help US policymakers charting a more cooperative relationship with China today. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating effect on many people, creating severe anxiety, fear, and complicated feelings or emotions. After the initiation of vaccinations against coronavirus, people's feelings have become more diverse and complex. Our aim is to understand and unravel their sentiments in this research using deep learning techniques. Social media is currently the best way to express feelings and emotions, and with the help of Twitter, one can have a better idea of what is trending and going on in people's minds. Our motivation for this research was to understand the diverse sentiments of people regarding the vaccination process. In this research, the timeline of the collected tweets was from December 21 to July21. The tweets contained information about the most common vaccines available recently from across the world. The sentiments of people regarding vaccines of all sorts were assessed using the natural language processing (NLP) tool, Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoner (VADER). Initializing the polarities of the obtained sentiments into three groups (positive, negative, and neutral) helped us visualize the overall scenario; our findings included 33.96% positive, 17.55% negative, and 48.49% neutral responses. In addition, we included our analysis of the timeline of the tweets in this research, as sentiments fluctuated over time. A recurrent neural network- (RNN-) oriented architecture, including long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), was used to assess the performance of the predictive models, with LSTM achieving an accuracy of 90.59% and Bi-LSTM achieving 90.83%. Other performance metrics such as precision, F1-score, and a confusion matrix were also used to validate our models and findings more effectively. This study improves understanding of the public's opinion on COVID-19 vaccines and supports the aim of eradicating coronavirus from the world. © 2021 Kazi Nabiul Alam et al.

AB  - Scholars in the field of community psychology have called for more research dedicated to examining White privilege as part of a system of White supremacy in the United States. One branch of this work focuses on awareness of White privilege, yet to date, this research has typically investigated awareness of White privilege at individual levels of analysis instead of also focusing on neighborhoods, schools, and other levels of analysis beyond the individual. In this study, we combine survey and U.S. Census data to explore both individual- and community-level predictors of White privilege awareness. With a sample of 1285 White college students, we found that gender, modern racism, social dominance orientation, and subjective socioeconomic status (SES) significantly predicted White privilege awareness. After accounting for these individual-level variables, we found that characteristics of students' hometowns (defined by zip code) predicted White privilege awareness. Specifically, greater income inequality was associated with higher White privilege awareness, while greater White racial homogeneity was marginally associated with lower White privilege awareness. There was a significant interaction between community-level White racial homogeneity and individual-level subjective SES, such that students with high subjective SES and low White racial homogeneity had the highest White privilege awareness. This study highlights the importance of examining different facets of ecological context in relation to White Americans' racial attitudes. © 2021 Society for Community Research and Action

AB  - Objective: The Family Affective Attitude Rating Scale (FAARS) uses an audio-recorded speech sample to measure parents’ affective attitudes toward their children. The present study investigated the psychometric properties of this scale for use with fathers, concurrent predictors of paternal affective attitudes (parental depressive symptoms, inter-parental relationship quality, observed paternal parenting), and associations between fathers’ positive and negative affective attitudes toward their two-year-old children and children’s behavior problems one year later. Methods: Participants were a sample (N = 226) of families from the Early Steps Multisite Study, a longitudinal study of low-income parents and children. Participants were racially and ethnically diverse (65% white; 23% Black or biracial; 12% Latinx). Results: Initial validation results support the reliability and validity of FAARS coding in fathers of preschoolers, a previously untested group. Both maternal and paternal depressive symptoms and interparental relationship quality were significantly associated with fathers’ affective attitudes toward their children. Further, fathers’ positive affective attitudes predicted lower mother-reported child behavior problems one year later, controlling for a host of demographic covariates, fathers’ observed parenting, mothers’ affective attitudes, and child baseline behavior problems. Conclusions: Results indicate that fathers’ positive attitudes toward their young children are a unique and robust predictor of lower levels of early behavior problems. © 2021 Society of Clinical Child & Adolescent Psychology.

AB  - Drawing on intergroup threat theory, this article argues that immigrant integration policies can improve public attitudes toward immigrants and, particularly, toward refugees and asylum-seekers. Examining evidence from an original survey experiment conducted in the United Kingdom, I find that support for admitting asylum-seekers increases when respondents are made aware that prospective asylum-seekers will be required to partake in language and civic-education courses. This effect is particularly strong among respondents who were more likely to perceive asylum-seekers as a symbolic threat (i.e., conservatives). Similarly, support for admitting asylum-seekers increases when respondents are told that future asylum-seekers will only have limited access to welfare. This effect is stronger among respondents who were more likely to view asylum-seekers as a material threat (i.e., conservatives and individuals with low socioeconomic status). These findings have important implications for the literatures on immigrant integration policies, intergroup threat theory, and public immigration attitudes generally. Importantly, the results reported in this article illustrate the significance of structural determinants for the study of immigration attitudes and demonstrate the importance of disaggregating immigrant integration policies when evaluating their effects. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - While most boundary-making studies examine native-born citizens’ opposition to immigration, this article explains why immigrants develop anti-immigrant attitudes. Under what conditions do previous generations of immigrants develop solidarity with newcomers? When might immigrants, instead, police national boundaries and oppose further immigration or naturalization? I argue that under uncertain citizenship status, long-term immigrants are unlikely to develop solidarity with newcomers, despite common experience with exclusionary citizenship policies. Drawing on interviews with naturalization applicants in the United Arab Emirates, this article analyses how policies that unevenly distribute rights and protections to non-citizens structure relationships between immigrant groups. Moving beyond citizen/non-citizen binaries, it calls attention to hierarchies among non-citizens, examining how long-term immigrants with partial and conditional rights police national boundaries to navigate exclusionary policies. When states restrict citizenship, making it a scarce good, immigrants may respond to uncertainty by competing and, thus, limiting access to that good for newcomers. When naturalization is arduous, applicants face pressures to continually perform citizenship to prove that they deserve inclusion. Naturalization applicants lacked citizenship, but they immigrated to the UAE before the establishment of its guest-worker program and claimed Emirati identity by differentiating themselves from “migrant workers.” I show how migration enforcement and boundary-policing factored into their perceptions and performances of what it meant to be a “good” Emirati citizen. Ethnic hierarchies and the timing of migration created distinctions between immigrants eligible for naturalization and those who were not. The mere possibility of inclusion in the citizenry may generate hierarchies between immigrants, precluding solidarity, and encouraging boundary-policing. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - How does ethnic identity affect political participation in China? The Chinese government gathers information and shapes public opinion through mass mobilization. These efforts include the managed mobilization of politically sensitive ethnic minorities. We draw on a dataset of the preferred political activities among 8,000 individuals in China, including more than 1,500 ethnic minority group members and find that politically sensitive minority groups rarely stay silent when faced with problems. Instead, they are more likely than the majority Han to participate and express grievances. However, ethnic minorities overwhelmingly prefer political participation by directly contacting the government, that is, through institutionalized and carefully managed channels. We show that populist authoritarian governments encourage political action by ethnic minorities through institutionalized channels while penalizing confrontational activities. As these minorities are integrated into Chinese society, measured by language proficiency, they tend to become politically more sophisticated in using nontraditional channels such as the internet and confrontation for problem solving. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - How youth come to understand their social identities and their relation to others’ identities can have important implications for the future of our society. In this article, we focus on how ethnic-racial identities (ERI) can serve to promote (or hinder) collective well-being. We first describe the nature of change in ethnic-racial identities over the course of childhood and adolescence. We then delineate three pathways by which youths’ ERI can be a mechanism for productive intergroup relations and thereby collective well-being as a: (a) basis for understanding differences and finding commonalities across groups; (b) promotive and protective resource for marginalized youth; and (c) springboard for recognizing and disrupting marginalization. This article concludes with how youths’ ERI can be nurtured into a source of resilience and resistance in the face of racism and xenophobia. Moreover, we urge researchers to consider the role ERI plays in guiding youth to challenge and resist marginalization. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The United States has witnessed waves of immigration throughout its history, with the current immigration policies regulated by the reforms enacted under President Lyndon Johnson in 1965. Immigrants now come from all over the world, with China and India supplying the largest numbers in science and engineering (S&E) fields. Although the US is seen as coping rather successfully with immigration from Europe, that is not the case with Asian immigration. Assimilation theorists have long argued that Asian immigrants face problems in adapting to the American culture and lifestyles; in contrast, multicultural theorists have hailed cultural diversity brought by Asian immigrants. Ethnic organizations can play an integral role in Asian immigrants' adaptation and integration in the United States. Utilizing 40 in-depth interviews of Indian immigrant engineers working in the US technology companies, the present study examines if they belong to ethnic associations. If yes, why do they feel a need to belong to these associations? If no, why not? It further sheds light on their need to belong to such associations. The findings show that the need to belong to Indian associations varied with the stage of their lives, which can be depicted as a U-shaped curve. © 2021 Brill Academic Publishers.

AB  - One reason Aristotle is distinguished as a philosopher is that he thought the philosopher investigated the causes of things. This paper raises the question: What are the causes of racial prejudice and racial discrimination. All ethical beings know that racial prejudice and racial discrimination are morally wrong, deplorable and should be completely eradicated. Deanna Jacobsen Koepke refers to Holt’s definitions in distinguishing racism from prejudice: “Racism is defined as hostility toward a group of people based on alleged inferiorities. Racism is a system of power and privilege that is at the foundation of society’s structures rather than prejudice, which is a hostile attitude toward a person based on trait he or she is assumed to have due to group membership.”1 This concept squarely places racism as the culprit to be extinguished. In this article, it is to be argued that to define racism as the target is only to observe the manifest phenomenon. The argument of the article is that racial prejudice and discrimination rest upon four pillars: political, economic, social and cultural. For simplicity of explanation, the social and cultural pillars shall be considered under the category of the political pillar, although the distinction between these pillars shall be noted. This article argues that these four pillars themselves, rest upon a foundation. The foundation is the deep psychological fear of the current, existing dominant economic group that the current existing dominated minority group will eventually usurp the power of the dominant economic group. The manifest form that this type of fear assumes is racial prejudice and discrimination. In its most extreme forms it then manifests as hate speech, hate action, hate brutality and hate murder.2 These manifestations provide the fuel that maintains the power imbalance and provides a camouflage for the four pillars that lie beneath the racist exterior. In this article, the political and economic pillars that underlie color racism will be examined first. The underlying deep psychological foundation shall be treated separately. In the end, the argument of this article is that color racism cannot be fully extinguished until its role as providing a mask for the underlying four pillars that consistently support inequality between different groups or classes are uprooted and the deep psychological fear that underlies them is eliminated.3 The masked function of color racism is its enormous power in perpetuating inequality; hence, the title of this paper, Unmasking Color Racism. © 2021, Polish Academy of Sciences - Institute of Philosophy and Sociology.

AB  - To examine the health beliefs that can influence engagement in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction health promotion activities among Zimbabwe-born immigrants in the US. Focus group interviews with 37 New England-based Zimbabwean immigrants in the US conducted between January and April 2019. Focus groups were led by study investigators who were members of the Zimbabwean community. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data were analyzed using framework analysis. Five themes emerged: (1) negative attitudes toward ill health, (2) mistrust toward western medicine, (3) stigma and taboo toward ill health, (4) a negative change in eating habits and (5) negative attitudes toward physical exercise. The participants’ attitudes and beliefs may interfere with their engagement in health promotion activities aimed at reducing the burden of CVD risk in this population. Understanding these beliefs paves the way for development of culturally congruent health promotion interventions in Zimbabwean and other African immigrant populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Zero-sum beliefs reflect the perception that one party’s gains are necessarily offset by another party’s losses.Although zero-sum relationships are, from a strictly theoretical perspective, symmetrical, we find evidence for asymmetrical zero-sum beliefs: The belief that others gain at one’s own expense, but not vice versa. Across various contexts (international relations, interpersonal negotiations, political partisanship, organizational hierarchies) and research designs (within-and between-participant), we find that people are more prone to believe that others’ success comes at their own expense than they are to believe that their own success comes at others’ expense. Moreover, we find that people exhibit asymmetric zero-sum beliefs only when thinking about how their own party relates to other parties but not when thinking about how other parties relate to each other. Finally, we find that this effect is moderated by how threatened people feel by others’ success and that reassuring people about their party’s strengths eliminates asymmetric zero-sum beliefs. We discuss the theoretical contributions of our findings to research on interpersonal and intergroup zero-sum beliefs and their implications for understanding when and why people view life as zero-sum © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Despite advances to promote acceptance and equity in many countries, prejudice remains a significant social problem. Promoting intergroup harmony requires knowledge about what works to reduce prejudice in community settings. This meta-analysis of field experiments reveals the most effective intervention types and conditions for reducing negative attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings. Across 69 intervention arms and 24,378 participants, results reveal that prejudice reduction interventions are effective at improving attitudes towards minority groups in real-world settings (d = 0.51, 95% CI [0.33; 0.68]). The prediction interval was −0.90 to 1.92. In this case, the prediction interval was particularly wide because of the high degree of heterogeneity detected in effect size. Subgroup analyses indicate that less commonly explored approaches, such as perceived variability, may have larger effect sizes than contact-based interventions. Still, more research is needed to confirm the effects of these less-researched approaches. Additionally, results show that interventions are more effective for school and college cohorts than for adults, and that the effects of prejudice reduction interventions endure over time. © 2021 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Prior Research Has Established Many Factors Which Are Linked With Mental Illness Stigma (Mis). One Such Factor Is That Of Socioeconomic Status (Ses). The Current Research Intended To Address If The Link Between Ses, Specifically Income Level, And Mis Might Be Explained By Social Dominance Orientation (Sdo) And The Legitimizing Myth That Mental Illness Onset Is Controllable In Nature. A Sample Of 926 Participants Reported Their Level Of Household Income And Completed Self-Report Measures Of Mis, Sdo, And Mental Illness Controllability Attributions (Mi-Control). Results Demonstrated That Higher Levels Of Income Were Associated With Higher Levels Of Mis, Sdo, And Mi-Control. Furthermore, A Significant Three-Path Mediated Effect Was Found From Ses To Mis Through Sdo And Mi-Control. Findings Highlight The Extent To Which Socio-Demographic Factors May Be Linked With Negative Attitudes Toward Those With Mental Illnesses, Particularly When Such Factors Work In Tandem With Competitive Social Worldviews.

AB  - Understanding when children develop a sense of group boundaries has implications for conflict and its resolution. Integrating social identity development theory and the developmental peace-building model, we investigated whether preferences for ethno-religious ingroup symbols mediate the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving among 5-to 11-year-old children from both majority and minority backgrounds in three settings of protracted intergroup conflict (N = 713, M = 7.97, SD = 1.52, 52.6% female). Participants represented the conflict rival ethno-religious groups in each setting (Northern Ireland [n = 299]: 48.5% Protestant, 51.5% Catholic; Kosovo [n = 220]: 54.1% Albanian, 45.9% Serbian; Republic of North Macedonia [RNM; n = 194]: 45.9% Macedonian, 54.1% Albanian) and were largely from lower to middle-class families; 4% of participants from other ethnic backgrounds were excluded from the current analyses. Multiple-group, bias-corrected bootstrapped mediation found that ingroup symbol preference mediated the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving; that is, older children expressed higher ingroup symbol preference, which was linked with lower outgroup giving. Across Northern Ireland, Kosovo, and the RNM, there was some significant variation in the strength of specific paths; however, there was a significant indirect effect in all three settings. The findings advance cross-cultural understanding of how age relates to ingroup symbol preferences and outgroup prosocial giving across the elementary school years, with © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Sparked by Israeli repression and ethnic cleansing campaigns in Jerusalem, the uprising of May 2021 featured a widescale mobilization that activated Palestinians across the entirety of the country. What brought about this moment and what was its impact? In this essay, I reflect on the historical moment that has become known to many as the “Unity Intifada” and how it highlighted the continued perseverance and oneness of the Palestinian people while simultaneously indicting their leadership. In a matter of weeks, Palestinians demonstrated that they retained the capacity to create change, notwithstanding the limitations of such change thanks to the ineffectual leadership class. © 2021 Institute for Palestine Studies.

AB  - Frederico Baptista de Souza was born to a slave mother during the period of the Free Womb Law in Brazil (1871). After slavery’s abolition, Souza campaigned in favor of full citizenship for formerly enslaved people. Black newspapers in São Paulo originated from the clubs of people who were prohibited from enjoying the clubs attended by whites regardless of their class. I examine the Black press’ rise through Souza, founder of one of the region’s oldest and longest running racial groups, the Dramatic and Recreational Guild Kosmos. Apart from coordinating, producing, and editing papers, Souza wrote op-eds and figured among those who shaped public opinion about Brazilian racial matters, often articulating ideas and concepts from other regions of the world, especially the “uplift generation” of the United States. Souza’s life is evidence of a once thriving and engaging Black press in this corner of the Atlantic that was São Paulo. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Given notable recent spikes in gun purchases in the U.S., we revisit the ‘fear and loathing’ hypothesis of firearm demand by (1) establishing how crime/victimization fears are shaped by broader economic, cultural, and racial status anxieties (those emerging from group status threats [loathing]) and (2) illustrating how both fear and loathing matter for protective gun ownership and gun carry (among owners), and openness to future protective ownership among non-owners. Using data from a nationwide survey of adults in the U.S. (n = 2,262) collected in 2019, we find that fears of crime and victimization are often more strongly associated with status anxieties than with safety threats. Both status anxieties and victimization are associated with protective ownership and carry. Among non-owners, those higher in cultural anxiety are especially likely to be open toward future protective gun ownership. This study illustrates the multidimensional fear-guns link, wherein both status-related threats and victimization-related fears shape why individuals own guns, and how they use guns. © 2021 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - Research on gender biases in politics and society finds security affairs to be a ‘stereotypically masculine’ issue area. Traditionally, men are seen as more credible sources of knowledge and authority in arenas such as crime and the military, while women are assumed to be more credible in ‘stereotypically feminine’ ones like childcare and health. But women’s roles in politics, media, and other influential sectors are rapidly changing in the Mediterranean and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. To test the conventional wisdom on gender and issue competency stereotypes in the media sector, we conducted an original public opinion survey of a nationally representative sample in Jordan (n = 885) assessing beliefs about the suitability of men versus women to report and offer commentary on national security affairs–specifically, an internal security threat described as a high-profile bank robbery. Strong patriarchal norms in Jordan suggest considerable bias should exist against women as sources of authority in stereotypically masculine domains and issue areas. Our survey results, however, do not support the conventional wisdom in public assessments of credibility, instead pointing to egalitarianism and even a modest credibility advantage for women on attributions of expertise. Given that theories of modernization, political knowledge, and social identity do not explain these counterintuitive findings, we make a theoretical contribution by proposing three novel explanations for why women in patriarchal contexts may at times avoid classic sexist backlash, and perhaps achieve greater credibility, as authorities on stereotypically masculine issue areas such as national security. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Individual and cultural factors play an important role in the emotional-social development. Culture creates differences in individuals’ cognitions, emotions and behaviors about events. One of the differences within culture is ethnic-racial differences. This study was generally aimed that personality traits, intergroup relations, empathy-prosocial behavior-morality and affects are the predictive power to ethnocultural empathy. This article includes four studies. Participants are students the Education Faculty of a university in the Aegean Region. Participans took demograph sheet, HEXACO, narcissistic personality and universality-diversity orientation scales in sudy−1, demongraph sheet, right-wing authoritarianism, discrimination, sensitivity to different cultural groups, social distance and social dominance orientation scales in study 2, demographic sheet, basic empathy, pro-social behavior and morality in study 3 and demographic sheet, trait anger, positive-negative affects towards outgroups and threat perception in study 4. Hierarchic regression analysis reveal that ethnicity and universality-diversity orientation predicts the etnocultural empathy in study1. Immigrant discrimination predicts the ethocultural empathy in study 2. Ethnicity, political tendency, basic empathy and pro- social behavior predicts the ethnocultural empathy in study 3. General threat perceptions towards outgroups predicts the ethnocultural empathy. A result of four studies has showed that the total variance of ethnocultural empathy was explained as.924%. The findings provide support for the best predictive variables of etnocultural empaty was been UDO, low immigrant discrimination, empathy-prosocial behavior, threat perception to out groups and ethnicity-religion-politic variable. According to the results of four studies from the same faculty, these variables explain the majority of the variance related to etnocultural empathy. Ethnocultural empathy may be an important effect in increasing intergroup contact and reducing conflicts and discriminatory attitudes in preservice teachers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Multiracial self-classifiers are the fastest-growing racial population in the United States. While their rise signals a departure from norms of hypodescent, little is known about the sociopolitical meanings attached to multiracial labels. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for understanding multiracials’ sense of racial group identity, linked fate, and racial attitudes. Examining a national opinion survey that samples more than 1200 multiracial adults, we compare the identity and attitudinal profiles of the two largest multiracial groups in the United States—White-Asians and White-Blacks—with those of their component monoracial groups. We find that while White-Asians and White-Blacks often distinguish themselves from their component races, on balance, the assertion of dual racial membership signals greater solidarity and/or affect toward the minority race. These findings suggest that members of these multiracial populations are likely to align themselves relatively more with their minority background than with Whites on political issues that are racial in nature. ©2021, Midwest Political Science Association

AB  - Objectives: Academia is grappling with how to address persistent underrepresentation and reduce inequities. With so many diversity-enhancing initiatives underway, some within the academic community might experience “diversity fatigue,” a construct we use to understand majority groups’ feelings of weariness toward diversity efforts. Method: For our testing purposes, we focused on ethnic and minority underrepresentation, and collected data in four studies from 473 White American students and faculty.Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and latent profile analysis, we develop and confirm the single factor structure of the final 6-item Diversity Fatigue scale. We measured associations with other established measures and examined the strength of the association between diversity fatigue and faculty’s support for a diversity-enhancing intervention. Results: Results demonstrated scale reliability, convergent validity with system-justifying beliefs, and offer suggestive evidence of discriminant validity with inclusion concerns and implicit race-based associations. Although mean levels of diversity fatigue were low overall,diversity fatigue scores were related to concerns about the effort involved with diversity work and were significantly associated with faculty’s motivation to adopt a diversity-enhancing classroom activity.Conclusions: Diversity fatigue in academia is a dampening in people’s response to or enthusiasm for efforts that improve the experience of underrepresented people. This state experience is connected to system-justifying beliefs and is related to concerns about the effort required to do diversity interventions. Understanding and measuring this construct has implications for the psychology of intergroup relations, as well as practical implications for campus communities committed to diversity programs. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - This work addresses the study of factors that increase the persuasive efficacy of testimonial messages aimed at improving intergroup attitudes. The results of two online experiments (N = 840) on the effect of empathy with, and similarity to, the protagonist in personal stories designed to improve attitudes towards immigrants are presented. In both studies, participants were given instructions to induce a certain exposure condition (empathy vs. an objective or distanced perspective) immediately before reading a narrative whose protagonist was an immigrant with high or low similarity to the audience. The results of mediation analysis show that both empathy and similarity increased identification and narrative transportation, which in turn reduced counterarguing, thus resulting in a more positive attitude towards the outgroup and lower threat perception. The results are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and the design of campaigns to reduce racism and xenophobia. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The 2019 Asrama Papua conflict in Surabaya initiated many dis-courses on racial discrimination and police brutality towards Papuan students in Indonesia. The question arises as to how the public perceive news framing and its effects on public opinion. This question will be answered by examining reports in the newspapers Kompas (published in Jakarta) and Jubi (Jayapura, Papua) which display quite different thematic and rhetorical structures. As secondary research, this article aims to assess the public opinion on the framing of the incident based on Berger and Luckmann’s Social Construction of Reality. Through qualitative focus group discussion, this study examines people’s perceptions of news media framing and its effect on the shaping of public opinion towards an ethnic minority group. The results show that media framing reinforces a certain idea of public opinion towards minority groups through various factors such as Perspective of Reporting and Depth of Re-porting, both of which differ in Kompas and Jubi as a result of differences in their audiences. Differences were also found in such factors as the thematic structure between lens of sympathy and lens of antagonism. Ultimately, this research suggests that the public possess an awareness of news framing, thus giving them the capability to construct their own critical viewpoints towards media and the incident. © 2021, Pacific Media Centre, Auckland University of Technology.

AB  - While a growing body of research has examined immigrants’ health generally, less is known specifically about the impact of immigration policy on the health of Chinese immigrants, the second-largest foreign-born population in the United States. This is due, in part, to the lack of methodologically well-trained, cross-cultural researchers who have both the cultural and linguistic expertise and health knowledge to engage with Chinese immigrant populations. This paper addresses this gap by examining Chinese cross-cultural researchers’ roles in the qualitative phase of the Research on ImmiGrant HealTh and State policy (RIGHTS) project, which sought to assess how immigration policies shaped Chinese and other immigrants’ experiences in healthcare and other related sectors in California. We used reflexivity to assess Chinese cross-cultural researchers’ positionality of insiderness and outsiderness and its influence on the process of data collection (i.e., recruitment, conducting interviews, transcription, and translation). Our reflexivity guides the assessment of the opportunities (e.g., expanding the recruitment pool, engaging participants more effectively in interviews, ensuring data integrity, and discussing heterogeneity within the Chinese immigrant community) and challenges (e.g., the difficulty of recruiting low-income and undocumented immigrants, addressing participants’ in-depth thoughts, the time-consuming nature of transcription and translation, and the assessment of power dynamics) in conducting immigrant health research with the Chinese community. These results highlight the need for cross-cultural researchers to help build trusting relationships with ethnic-minority communities, thus gaining new insights and advancing knowledge within the field of ethnic minority health research. These insights can guide future investigations of Chinese and other immigrant communities as research on immigration policy and health expands. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - There are many conflicting theories about the relationship between media reports and public opinion, but few of them are supported by empirical work on large data sets. We use sentiment results on over 260,000 China-related articles in The New York Times to show that events in international relations affect media sentiment which, in turn, affects public opinion. We find that sudden shifts in US-China relations are accompanied by changes in how The New York Times covers China and that the news reporting on China leads public opinion on China by 1 year. Our work illustrates how The New York Times, a prestigious mass media institution, propagates international relation signals to shape American views of the Chinese state and the Chinese people. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article presents a crucial test for the theory of party cues by investigating the association between the legislative positions of the Brazilian political party system in a government-opposition dimension and the governmental assessment made by their supporters. The context of the test is the Fernando Henrique Cardoso government (1995-2002), characterized by successive economic crises, which would tend to reduce the parties’ influence over public opinion, in face of the traditional explanatory power of theories of economic voting and VP-functions. The results, based on multilevel models built upon seven surveys, suggest that party cues work even in a country like Brazil and in the adverse context chosen for this empirical test. The findings also indicate that party cues were stronger according to the media relevance of each political party. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we seek to explain the determinants of individual-level attitudes of Brazilians towards free-trade. We use national survey data collected by the project “O Brasil, as Américas e o mundo” and show that Brazilians support open trade. We argue that individual attitudes are guided by economic interests, ideational factors, and political values. The low exposure of the Brazilian economy to international competition seems to contribute to favorable opinions about access to imported goods. Ideological preferences, in turn, filter these perceptions regardless of the individual’s economic conditions. Overall, our results are similar to the findings of a broad literature on trade-policy preference in developed countries. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The 2018 Central American migrant crisis, in which thousands of people traveled through Mexico in caravans toward the United States border, was a milestone in Mexican immigration policies. The humanitarian crisis evidenced the poverty and vulnerability to which migrants are exposed in their places of origin. At the same time, immigration policies in Mexico became more restrictive due to both internal and external political pressure and, as a result, the securitization measures have become more pervasive than all other migration control policies. This article suggests that this new approach to migration could be ineffective over the long-term, whilst becoming increasingly dangerous for migrants. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The introduction to the special issue offers a six-points framework for analyzing both the impact of the pandemic on nationalism and the broader multinational state as well as the significance of multinationalism for the response to the pandemic. These points correspond to the following questions: (1) How has multinationalism (as a sociological fact and/or a political culture that has conditioned governance practices and institutional frameworks) shaped the response to the crisis? (2) How has the crisis affected the self-determination objectives and strategies of the nationalist movement? (3) Have national divides (as observed, for example, in public opinion and in statements from politicians) become more or less salient during, and as a result of, the crisis? (4) What issues have produced tensions between national communities, or between minority nations and the state? (5) What governments, parties, or individual politicians have most gained or lost from the crisis in terms of putting forward or managing self-determination claims? (6) What could be the impact of the crisis on the nationalist movement and on the multinational state as a whole?. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Theories of out-group hostility have long held that attitudes about marginalized groups are important predictors of policy support. These theories, however, have mostly examined the attitudes of white people and sexual orientation has rarely been a category of analysis. Thus, we know less about whether these theories are conditional on group position in racial and sexual hierarchies. This paper argues that processes of marginalization shape out-group hostility. Using comparative relational analysis, I examine support for pro-minority policies among white lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people, straight people of color and whites. I find that ethnocentrism is not a general predictor of out-group hostility among the members of marginalized groups. Alternatively, group-targeted homophobia, racism, and nativism predict opposition to pro-minority policies, but the members of marginalized groups have more egalitarian attitudes overall. These findings challenge long-held conventional wisdoms about prejudice, underscoring the importance of centering on marginalized groups in public opinion. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Non-Hispanic (NH) Black, American Indian/Alaska Native (Indigenous), and NH-White men have the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rates among all other racial/ethnic groups. Contributing factors are multifaceted, yet no studies have examined the psychometric properties of a comprehensive survey examining potential masculinity barriers to CRC screening behaviors among these populations. This study assessed the psychometric properties of our Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care (MBMC) Scale among NH-Black, Indigenous, and NH-White men who completed our web-based MBMC, Psychosocial Factors, and CRC Screening Uptake & Intention Survey. We conducted exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 254 men and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on a separate sample of 637 men nationally representative by age and state of residence. After psychometric assessment, the MBMC scale was reduced from 24 to 18 items and from six to four subscales. NH-Black men’s mean scores were lowest on three of four subscales (Being Strong, Negative and Positive Attitudes) and highest on the Acknowledging Emotions subscale. Compared with both Indigenous and NH-White men, NH-Black men had significantly lower Negative Attitudes subscale scores and significantly higher scores on the Acknowledging Emotions subscale. Compared with both Indigenous and NH-Black men, NH-White men had significantly higher Being Strong and Positive Attitudes subscales scores. This study expands on previous research indicating that, among racialized populations of men, endorsement of traditional masculine ideologies influences engagement in preventive health behaviors. Our scale can be tailored to assess attitudes to screening for other cancers and diseases that disproportionately burden medically underserved populations. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - There are various theoretical approaches for understanding intergroup biases among children and adolescents. This article focuses on the social identity approach and argues that existing research will benefit by more fully considering the implications of this approach for examining intergroup relations among youngsters. These implications include (a) the importance of self-categorization, (b) the role of self-stereotyping and group identification, (c) the relevance of shared understandings and developing ingroup consensus, and (d) the importance of coordinated action for positive and negative intergroup relations. These implications of the social identity approach suggest several avenues for investigating children’s and adolescents’ intergroup relations that have not been fully appreciated in the existing literature. However, there are also limitations to the social identity approach for the developmental understanding and some of these are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Various economic and social characteristics have been used to explain individual vote choice in the 2016 British EU Referendum. Recently, researchers have considered the role various psychological orientations have played in this vote choice. Here, we are interested in two in particular: right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO); constructs that are often used to predict a host of political attitudes and behaviors, particularly those where group identities are a central issue. Those high in RWA prefer group uniformity and are willing to use coercion to enforce this preference. Those high in SDO prefer group-based, hierarchical social and political systems over more egalitarian systems. These orientations are therefore likely to have played a role in people’s vote choice in this referendum. Using data from the 2014–2019 British Election Study internet panel we show that RWA and SDO powerfully influence anti-immigrant attitudes and pro-sovereignty attitudes; attitudes strongly associated with individual vote choice. Our findings suggest that the EU Referendum effectively rallied people’s prejudices against foreign and domestic outsiders to pull the United Kingdom from the European Union. © 2021 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.

AB  - To what extent can civil rights NGOs protect ethnic minorities against unequal treatment? We study this question by combining an audit experiment of 1260 local governments in Hungary with an intervention conducted in collaboration with a major Hungarian civil rights NGO. In the audit experiment we demonstrated that Roma individuals were about 13 percent-points less likely to receive responses to information requests from local governments, and the responses they received were of substantially lower quality. The intervention that reminded a random subset of local governments of their legal responsibility of equal treatment led to a short-term reduction in their discriminatory behavior, but the effects of the intervention dissipated within a month. These findings suggest that civil rights NGOs might face substantive difficulties in trying to reduce discrimination through simple information campaigns. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The global trend of poorer outcomes across the HIV treatment cascade for men has drawn attention to the importance of engaging men in prevention and treatment services. The South African construction industry is one of the economic sectors most adversely affected by HIV/AIDS. Previous research on HIV testing behaviour among workers in the industry has revealed that male workers are less likely to be tested than female workers. Given this gender differential, this study employed a field-administered survey to gather data from 450 site-based, male construction workers in Western Cape, South Africa. An integrated model comprising demographic, cognitive, and behavioural factors was then hypothesised to explain HIV testing behaviour. Bivariate analysis and structural equation modelling were then used to test the model. Findings indicate that HIV knowledge, having previously had an STI, and possessing a positive attitude towards HIV testing are terminal predictors of testing behaviour. As a strategy for positively influencing testing behaviour, employers should ensure that effective communication about HIV testing is established with workers across all levels of education and ethnic groups. Interventions relating to risky sexual behaviour need particular attention, and where possible HIV testing should be coupled with general STI screening. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The need to make higher education curricula gender-inclusive is increasingly pressing as student cohorts diversify. We adopted a student-staff partnership approach to design, integrate, and evaluate a module that taught first-year science students the difference between biological sex, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation in the context of genetics concepts at an Australian university. This module aimed to break the binary in misconceptions of both sex and gender, emphasising that both exist on separate spectra. Data triangulation was used to evaluate students' attitudes towards the module and their learning of module concepts. Students' attitudes were positive overall, and evaluation of students' learning indicated that the majority of students understood and retained key concepts, while also identifying common misconceptions. Perhaps the most important finding was that students who identified as belonging to a minority group had significantly more positive attitudes towards the module than non-minority students. This finding supports previous research that has found inclusive curricula have greater benefit for students from minority backgrounds, indicating the importance of making such curriculum enhancements. Our results speak to both the co-creation process and students' learning outcomes, providing valuable insights for practitioners both within science and beyond. © 2021 University of Calgary.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, as a global threat to humanity, is likely to instigate a variety of collective responses in the society. We examined, for the first time, whether the COVID-19 threat perception is related to attitudes towards Syrian refugees in Turkey, theorizing a dual pathway whereby pandemic-induced threat would relate to both pro- and anti-immigrant feelings. Drawing upon integrated threat theory and models of collective-threat regulation, we expected that pandemic threat would lead to more exclusionary outgroup attitudes through increased immigrant threat, whereas we argued that perceived COVID-19 threat would promote inclusionary attitudes through creating a common ingroup in the face of a global threat. Using online search volume data at the province level (Study 1, N = 81) and self-reporting measures at the individual level (Study 2, N = 294), we found that the COVID-19 threat was directly associated with more positive attitudes towards refugees (Study 1 and 2). Study 2 further revealed indirect positive (through a sense of common identity) and negative (through perceptions of immigrant threat) links between COVID-19 threat perception and outgroup attitudes. These results highlight the importance of integrating threat regulation and social identity perspectives when assessing the implications of pathogen-related threats. Copyright: © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Autonomous intelligent agents participate in complex social situations. It is necessary that agents are aware of their society and still understand their context of action and interaction. Such social situation with other agents is influenced by society’s characteristics, including their norms, values, common interests and objectives, members, and social structures. Each complex society is broken down into social groups, each one with an identity. Social identity theory is seen as an analysis of intergroup relations in social categories based on the cognitive definition and the autoconcept of a social group and their belonging. Researchers have been studying this theory in computing, more specifically in multiagent systems. Social exchanges are the object of study in diverse contexts in which social relations are understood as social exchanges. One of the investigated themes is the self-regulation of social exchanges. The game of self-regulation of social exchanges explores its self-regulation but it does not analyse the agents’ identity. Therefore, this research investigates the integration of psychosocial analysis of social identity theory into the social adaptive complex society of the game of self-regulation of social exchanges. The principal result of this work is the GSRSEPSIT, a social simulation model. © Operational Research Society 2021.

AB  - In an era of rising global intra-regional migration, in-depth explorations of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration (ATII) in emerging migrant-receiving societies in Asia are scarce. Using Taiwan as a case of an emerging non-Western, democratic migrant-receiving context with a racially homogeneous population, aging social structure, and vibrant civic culture, this is the first study to examine receptivity to three major migrant types. The study contributes to the ATII literature and sociological research through discovering something old (perceived group threat of foreign professionals and labor migrants at the individual level), something new (link between positive attitudes toward same-sex marriage and higher receptivity to blue-collar migrants), something borrowed (civic behavior), and something context-specific (effect of the high visibility of marriage immigrants in certain places on receptivity). This study highlights the importance of uncovering patterns and mechanisms of nativity-, ethnicity-, and class-based foreigner exclusionism in emerging non-Western migrant destinations. The findings on receptivity toward intra-Asia migrants in a 21st-century Asian society illuminate possibilities for reinventing theories on the social organization of difference and the socio-cognitive construction of ethnicity, with broader relevance to inter-minority relations among Asians in traditional Western immigrant societies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In many countries, intense political contestation unfolded around the question of how Sars-CoV-2 should be contained. In this case study, I try to understand why members of the German public came to vastly differing judgements on the containment policies. In summer 2020, I conducted 48 semi-structured interviews to investigate respondents’ belief systems, attitude structures, and communicative practices. I found that disparate policy preferences were partly based on incompatible interpretations of the crisis and went hand in hand with deep institutional mistrust between strict opponents. Stereotypes about supporters and opponents had formed, and people avoided discussions with opposing camps. However, my data also suggest that moderate opponents and supporters overlapped in their criticism of anxiety-inducing media coverage and fuzzy governmental communication. No fully-fledged social identities had formed, and respondents were forcibly exposed to other opinions in their close personal networks. Altogether, my study extends the knowledge of political polarisation around COVID-19 by unravelling the interpretations and mechanisms that underlie disparate policy preferences during the pandemic. © 2021 EURICOM.

AB  - Researching public opinion in ethnic minority areas of Vietnam in general and ethnic minority area of Northern Vietnam in particular to understand what people are desiring is essential. Ethnic minorities in Northern Vietnam are not only concerned with the urgent issues associated with their daily lives, but also diverse social issues in an age where communication is strongly developing. People always show dynamism and activeness in practices related to public opinion. And remarkably, in this picture, there is no clear slice between modern elements of the globalization context and traditional elements. Views that ethnic minorities are always passive need to be revised. It is necessary to create conditions for people to participate more effectively in the policy making process. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2021

AB  - This longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study investigated affective forecasting as a moderator of positive intergroup contact effects among adolescents. We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (Mage = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents’ positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - False consensus, or biased projection of one’s opinion onto others, has repeatedly been described by political communication scholars as a derivative of selective exposure to attitude-consistent information. This study proposes a distinctive approach to understanding the phenomenon by suggesting “perceived threat” as a motivational factor that contributes to self-serving estimates of public opinion. Based on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, we test a path model in which political ideology relates to false consensus regarding the issue of immigration through cognitive assessments of communication environment and perceived immigration threat. Results suggest that the relationship between cognition and false consensus may not be direct but instead works through motivational factors when one perceives threat, and that conservatives are more sensitive to outgroup threat and thus are more likely to overestimate public consensus for their attitudes on immigration than their ideological counterparts. Implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Although classrooms have been described as an important socialization agent for the development of intergroup attitudes, the role of classroom climate has rarely been investigated. This 5-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of cooperative classroom climate for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analyses showed that adolescents who perceived classroom climate to be more cooperative had lower levels of anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth who perceived the classroom climate as less cooperative. Similarly, classrooms with a more cooperative climate were more positive toward immigrants than classrooms with a less cooperative climate. In addition, cooperative classroom climate did not moderate the effects of classroom ethnic diversity on youth attitudes. These findings suggest that cooperative classroom climate reduces the risk of prejudice development. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Drawing on an examination of Chinese language textbooks for Tibetan ethnic students in the Tibet Autonomous Region of mainland China, this study scrutinises the representation of Tibetan images and the official attitude towards Tibet embedded in the textbooks. Using multimodal discourse analysis (MDA), the paper investigates how government perceptions of Tibet are constructed through the co-deployment of visual and textual semiotic resources in Chinese language textbooks. This study suggests an overall positive attitude towards Tibet shown in the textbooks. However, the references to Tibet or Tibetans are usually situated as topics of the ‘past’, which indicates a sense of their being uncivilised or backwards. The positive yet stereotyped portrayal of Tibet is in line with national identity construction to ensure a unified nation-state. This study examines both text and image in textbooks in order to understand state ideologies and official attitudes towards a minority group. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examines how symbolic, psychological and material factors influence how Americans view migrants before and after the heated 2016 primary season leading to the nomination of Donald Trump as the Republican Party's presidential candidate. We hypothesize that prior unfavorable predispositions towards migrants, preference for high skilled migrants, personality traits, and material variables strongly influence views on migrants. We examine the effect of these variables with two controlled experiments set a year apart, before and after the 2016 primary election. The experiments manipulate the ethnicity (Asian, Hispanic, Arab) and skill level (high skilled or low skilled) of migrant groups. In both experiments, we find that respondents have an overall positive view of migrants regardless of ethnicity. However, those respondents who hold anti-immigrant stereotypes, have authoritarian personalities, and whose economic standing is worsening see immigrants as threatening. We also find that negative emotion plays a mediating role in this process. © 2022 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical perspective during the Islamic civilization on the people with special needs by examining the historical texts and stories. The concept of disability was broadly categorised in the early Islamic civilization, which not only included people with physical or mental disability but also people with poor socioeconomic status. Several references were identified in relation to the concept of disability, such as the Prophet himself indulged in various activities of providing care and support to the disadvantage groups, laid a path of embodying the shared responsibility of empowering the disadvantaged groups in the society through various approaches, which not only focused on providing financial support but also in providing care and support. Accordingly, the application of these principles was embodied in to Islamic laws which were successfully applied in providing the rights for disabled through the Islamic civilization in various regions. It was identified that the people's attitudes towards disabled were deeply rooted in to their faith and belief systems related to Islam. In addition, the people's attitudes towards disabled were also based on their awareness and interpretation of Islamic concepts, texts and laws, which resulted in both positive and negative attitudes. © 2021 Islamic Cultural Centre.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perceived threat from asylum seekers in EU (EUAS) on attitudes toward Israeli local outgroups, controlling for face to-face interaction with the latter. The study was conducted using an online survey of 1311 Israeli Jews. Realistic threat from EUAS was negatively related to positive attitudes toward three local outgroups, while the association between symbolic threat from EUAS and attitudes toward the local outgroups was insignificant. The effect of distant realistic threat was more pronounced than the effect of symbolic threat and the effect of face-to-face contact.

AB  - The present study aimed to enhance our understanding of racial/ethnic minorities’ stress, and suggest possible ways to reduce their stressful feelings at work. Racial minorities were compared with non-minorities in terms of their satisfaction about diverse work environments and the effects of work environment on stressful feelings. Hypotheses were tested, using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses and t-tests. According to the findings, the strain of racial/ethnic minorities was differently affected by work environment factors such as public support and goal attainability, compared to that of non-minorities. Some demographic factors also had different effects on the strain of racial/ethnic minorities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Polling data routinely indicate broad support for the concept of diverse schools, but integration initiatives—both racial and socioeconomic—regularly encounter significant opposition. We leverage a nationally representative survey experiment to provide novel evidence on public support for integration initiatives. Specifically, we present respondents with a hypothetical referendum where we provide information on two policy options for assigning students to schools: (1) a residence-based assignment option and (2) an option designed to achieve stated racial/ethnic or socioeconomic diversity targets, with respondents randomly assigned to the racial/ethnic or socioeconomic diversity option. After calculating public support and average willingness-to-pay, our results demonstrate a clear plurality of the public preferring residence-based assignment to the racial diversity initiative, but a near-even split in support for residence-based assignment and the socioeconomic integration initiative. Moreover, we find that the decline in support for race-based integration, relative to the socioeconomic diversity initiative, is entirely attributable to White and Republican respondents. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Resilience – the ability to bounce back from hardship – is a concept that has become popular during the years of economic crisis and post-recession. Contemporary citizens are expected to be flexible, have a positive attitude and take care of themselves in a context of heightened inequality and precarity. The objective of this article is to analyze how citizens in post-recession Spain respond to media representations that prescribe these values. Eight focus groups were held with middle- and working-class men and women (a total of 62 participants) who discussed four short stories written by the researchers, which condensed the main concepts found in media narratives studied previously (including TV series, reality TV, advertisements, video games and celebrity culture). The results of our analysis show that participants tended to praise change and adaptability. The ‘complacent citizen’, who seeks security and refuses to adapt to the current precarious and unstable environments, emerges as a ‘bad citizen’, and security and stability are pathologized. There were differences between the middle- and working-class groups: while the former clearly adhered to the neoliberal discourse that sees flexibility and self-improvement as a moral obligation, the latter showed a more ambivalent response to these discourses. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Colour-blind attitudes deny racial dynamics and can lead to resistance to transformation because there seems to be no need for it. This study investigated these attitudes amongst students at a university campus engaged with implementing its transformation agenda. Aim: Using a survey, the research determined the prevalence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and evaluated the social factors that may have contributed to these attitudes. Setting: The research was conducted amongst undergraduates at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, South Africa, in 2017. Methods: A literature review was conducted around the occurrence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and the associated social factors. Race, gender, racial prejudice, just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation in particular were found to contribute to colour-blind attitudes. A quantitative survey was then conducted amongst a quota sample of 300 students. The data collected on the social factors and colour-blind attitudes were statistically analysed. Results: The students’ colour-blind attitudes were found to be moderate. The social factor of race correlated significantly with colour-blind attitudes, but gender did not. Racial prejudice presented a medium correlation with colour-blind attitudes but just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation only a small correlation. Conclusion: Colour-blind attitudes at the campus were related to race and racial prejudice. This demonstrates the need for students to be offered room to openly discuss and engage with race and issues concerning race. The difference between the findings in this study and extant literature indicates a necessity for further qualitative research to gain a more comprehensive understanding about racial issues amongst students at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus. © 2021.

AB  - There are worldwide concerns about the rise of White nationalism and its implications for intergroup relations in multicultural societies. Social media, in particular, has allowed far-right groups to easily share their perspectives with and influence others in support of their ideologies. Yet, few studies have empirically examined what psychological factors are discussed within this content to motivate collective action. A quantitative content analysis of 100 White nationalist videos on YouTube reveals that social outgroups (Muslims, immigrants, feminists) are frequently discussed as threats to Whites’ status. Not only were calls for collective action discussed in at least 12% of videos, themes surrounding White identity and injustice faced by Whites were often underlying these calls, consistent with the theoretical propositions of the Social Identity Model of Collective Action. These results are novel as they identify psychological mechanisms referenced in White nationalist social media that motivate collective actions among White Americans. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - What are people’s expectations of interracial political coalitions? This research reveals expectations of flexible interracial coalitions stemming from how policies and racial groups are viewed in terms of perceived status and foreignness. For policies seen as changing societal status (e.g., welfare), people expected Black–Hispanic political coalitions and viewed Asian Americans as more likely to align with Whites than with other minorities. For policies seen as impacting American identity (e.g., immigration), people expected Asian–Hispanic coalitions and that Black Americans would align with Whites more than other minorities. Manipulating a novel group’s alleged status and cultural assimilation influenced coalitional expectations, providing evidence of causality. These expectations appear to better reflect stereotypes than groups’ actual average policy attitudes and voting behavior. Yet these beliefs may have implications for a diversifying electorate as White Americans strategically amplified the political voice of a racial group expected to agree with their personal preferences on stereotyped policies. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - In the effort to prevent school shootings in the United States, policies that aim to arm teachers with guns have received considerable attention. Recent research on public support for these policies finds that African Americans are substantially less likely to support them, indicating that support for arming teachers is a racial issue. Given the racialized nature of support for punitive crime policies in the United States, it is possible that racial sentiment shapes support for arming teachers as well. This study aims to determine the association between two types of racial sentiment—explicit negative feelings toward racial/ethnic minority groups and racial resentment—and support for arming teachers using a nationally representative data set. While explicit negative feelings toward African Americans and Hispanics are not associated with support for arming teachers, those with racial resentments are significantly more likely to support arming teachers. Racial resentment also weakens the effect of other variables found to be associated with support for arming teachers, including conservative ideology and economic pessimism. Implications for policy and research are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In 2019, the environment began to rival the economy among priority issues for the UK public. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to shift this balance in either direction, because the crisis is not only causing serious economic damage but is also highlighting the usefulness of expert warnings. The current work examines the balance between public prioritisation of environment and economy in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A nationally representative YouGov sample of 1654 UK adults were presented with two political speeches, either linking COVID-19 to climate and prioritising environment as part of planned economic recovery, or separating the issues and stating that environmental prioritisation is now unaffordable. Most participants (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech, and it was more popular than the other speech (which 36% were positive towards). The same proportion of Conservative voters (62%) were positive towards the environmental prioritisation speech (with 50% positive towards the other speech). Higher support for the environmental prioritisation speech was associated with more education but not with socioeconomic status. Voting history and socioeconomic status were therefore less predictive of differences in support for the speeches than expected based on previous research. Consistent with these results is the suggestion that environmental concern in the UK is becoming less tied to social identity and more tied to concern for personal well-being. These findings suggest that foregrounding environmental concerns is politically realistic in post-COVID-19 economic policy, consistent with suggestions from economists and environmental scientists that an environmental focus is feasible and necessary. © 2021, PsychOpen.

AB  - Opposition to immigration has featured prominently in the “cultural backlash” to globalization in Western nations and was a key determinant of Britain’s Brexit referendum. In this article, we draw on theories of intergroup threat to examine the effect of “right-wing authoritarianism” on immigration attitudes in the UK. Previous research suggests that cultural aspects of immigration are especially important in shaping anti-immigrant attitudes. We use an original survey measuring attitudes toward immigration from differing skill levels and national origins. We find that right-wing authoritarianism is a much stronger predictor of immigration attitudes than other attributes. In addition, the effect of right-wing authoritarianism varies by immigrant origin, most strongly predicting opposition toward immigrant groups that may be perceived as culturally distant. We also find evidence that these effects are driven by the “aggression” component of right-wing authoritarianism, a facet of authoritarianism that captures a predisposition toward the enforcement of group norms. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Despite the widely recognised importance of diversity for business performance, knowledge concerning the support needs of under-represented groups is still limited. We adopt an intersectional approach to analyse the challenges and support needs of ethnic minority entrepreneurs, and those with disabilities, to participate in entrepreneurial activity in the UK. Our qualitative data is based on focus groups and semi-structured interviews. The findings suggest that engagement in entrepreneurship is influenced not just by minority status, but by the specific relations to other socio-demographic categories within which that status is embedded. Intersectional counter-frames form part of the strategies utilised by individuals to gain access to otherwise limited resources. We develop a conceptual model for promoting greater equality, diversity and inclusion, within an entrepreneurial ecosystem, and recommend a more holistic approach to realising inclusive economic growth. This includes adopting a hybrid/blended approach that combines targeted programs with the development of mainstream support programs. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Increased immigration and demographic changes have not only resulted in political pushback, but also in violent attacks against immigrants. Several recent terrorist attacks committed by White supremacists invoke rhetoric around a deliberate attempt to make Whites extinct and replace them with non-Western immigrants. Yet, while it is widely acknowledged among extremism researchers that this perception of orchestrated extinction or replacement has tremendous potential to lead to violent extremism, its consequences have not yet been directly examined. Using the Scandinavian context (e.g., Denmark and Norway), in two correlational studies and one experiment, we provide evidence that this perception is associated with the persecution of Muslims, violent intentions, and Islamophobia. Further, we demonstrate that these associations are mediated by symbolic threats. Conspiracy beliefs that one’s group is being replaced seem to drive hostile intergroup attitudes. We discuss the societal implications of this finding (i.e., generating fear, polarization, and hostile public opinion towards immigrants). © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: There has been a noticeable increase in the number of studies concerned with mental health literacy (MHL), specifically among students. Still, very few studies have examined MHL among students of non-Western minority groups. Aims: This study examined MHL among Arab students in Israel based on Jorm’s conceptual framework. Methods: Twenty-eight Arab students in Israel took part in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. Most were single and Muslim, in their second year of studies, and most reported low socioeconomic status. The data were analyzed thematically, guided by the Jorm’s six MHL dimensions. Results: Different levels of literacy were found in the various MHL dimensions. The participants identified severe mental disorders more easily than mood disorders; reported a variety of possible causes of mental disorders; were well aware of available professional help (apart for rehabilitative services); identified significant barriers to mental health help seeking, as Arabs; and reported the internet as a major source of information about mental health problems and their treatment Conclusions: The participants’ MHL appeared to be associated with their unique sociocultural characteristics. This study stresses the need to raise MHL among Arab students in Israel, and in particular to promote positive attitudes to seeking professional help. It also highlights the need to develop culturally adapted mental health interventions for the Arab population in Israel. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This exploratory study examined changes in intergroup attitudes and interpersonal relationships between members of virtual groups from diverse and conflicting backgrounds in an intergroup contact program. Seventy-six students took part in a collaborative online course during one academic year connecting Jews and Arabs in Israel. They marked their perceived distance to their team members at the beginning and end of the course using the novel Team Circles tool. Initially both Arab and Jewish students felt closer to their in-group team members. However, perceived distances decreased significantly over time with Arab students reporting equal perceived distances to their in-group and out-group members after the course. The results from the Team Circles test were combined with repeated measures of intergroup attitudes using Implicit Association Tests. Although no significant changes in intergroup attitudes were observed, greater reduction in perceived distances to out-group team members resulted in lower levels of prejudice toward the out-group as a whole after the course. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Polyculturalism, a relatively new intergroup ideology conceptualises culture as dynamic by emphasising intergroup connections. Previous research has linked polyculturalism to less negative attitudes towards different racial and ethnic groups. However, the underpinnings of this relationship is not well understood. It was predicted that openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative and control) would be associated with lower racial and ethnic prejudice and that polyculturalism would mediate these relationships. Method: The sample consisted of 391 undergraduate students and community members who completed a polyculturalism measure, openness to experience and agreeableness scales of the Big Five Aspect Scale, the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, and the Australian Racism, Acceptance, and Culture-Ethnocentrism Scale. Results: Path analysis indicated openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative) were each associated with less generalised racial and ethnic prejudice, and that polyculturalism mediated the relationship between openness to experience and prejudice and cognitive flexibility- alternative and prejudice. Conclusion: Polyculturalism may be an important avenue for understanding and reducing racial and ethnic prejudice in a racially and ethnically diverse Australia. Key Points What is already known about this topic: The traits of openness to experience and agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility are associated with less negative racial and ethnic attitudes. Polyculturalism is a lay diversity ideology where culture is viewed as a dynamic and evolving system that does not provide the basis for differentiating between groups. Instead of focusing on differences between cultural groups, connections between groups through interactions are emphasised. Polyculturalism is associated with less negative attitudes towards different racial and ethnic groups among other pro-diversity attitudes. What this topic adds: This study adds to the limited research into the role of lay diversity ideologies in explaining the relationship between personality and intergroup attitudes. Openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative) were each associated with less generalised racial and ethnic prejudice. Polyculturalism mediated the relationship between openness to experience and racial and ethnic prejudice, and the relationship between cognitive flexibility (alternative) and racial and ethnic prejudice. The Racism Acceptance and Cultural-Ethnocentrism Scale (RACES) is a psychometrically sound measure developed for the Australian context. It is a suitable tool for measuring the effectiveness of interventions for promoting more positive intergroup attitudes. © 2021 Australian Psychological Society.

AB  - Among a wide range of challenges, EU member states have been facing a growing threat from terrorism in the recent years. The primary responsibility for combating terrorism lies with each individual member state, although the threat is becoming increasingly cross-border and diverse. Regardless of whether terrorism poses a real or perceived threat to the states’ and citizens’ security, public opinion is one important force behind the extensive counterterrorism efforts undertaken in Europe. In this article, we explore the influence of public opinion on EU policy within the security domain in the period 2005–19. We investigate the relationship between the number of attacks carried out on EU territory and citizens’ increased concern for terrorist attacks, as well as the attention given to this topic by EU decision-makers. Based on data from Eurobarometer, the Global Terrorism Database, and evidence from official documents, we perform an analysis of the connection between public perception and anti-terrorism policy coordination in the EU. The results of this investigation point to increasing levels of collective securitization and an ever-stronger focus on security and counterterrorism in the European Union.

AB  - Previous research has provided evidence that teachers implicitly hold more negative attitudes toward ethnic minority students than toward ethnic majority students. Furthermore, they attribute the lower educational success of ethnic minority students predominantly to internal causes. So far, it is not known how implicit attitudes and causal attributions are related to preservice teachers’ judgments of students’ academic competencies. We conducted a study to close this research gap. In a sample of preservice teachers, our study showed mainly negative implicit attitudes toward ethnic minority students. On general, the preservice teachers made external attributions. Implicit attitudes as well as causal attributions predicted the judgments. Preservice teachers with more negative attitudes and preservice teachers, who attributed the failure of ethnic minority students to these students’ abilities, less favorably judged the competence of ethnic minority students. Our results highlight the role of teachers’ attitudes and causal attributions in determining the disadvantages that ethnic minority students experience in school. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In the context of the United States of America (U.S.), COVID-19 has influenced migrant experiences in a variety of ways, including the government's use of public health orders to prevent migration into the country and the risk of immigrants contracting COVID-19 while in detention centers. However, this paper focuses on barriers that immigrants of diverse statuses living in the U.S.—along with their families—may face in accessing health services during the pandemic, as well as implications of these barriers for COVID-19 prevention and response efforts. We report findings from a scoping review about immigration status as a social determinant of health and discuss ways that immigration status can impede access to health care across levels of the social ecology. We then develop a conceptual outline to explore how changes to federal immigration policies and COVID-19 federal relief efforts implemented in 2020 may have created additional barriers to health care for immigrants and their families. Improving health care access for immigrant populations in the U.S. requires interventions at all levels of the social ecology and across various social determinants of health, both in response to COVID-19 and to strengthen health systems more broadly. © 2021

AB  - Since 2014, many refugees and asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East have arrived in Europe. At the same time, we also observe that the public’s attitudes toward this group are becoming increasingly negative. Because of the rapid increase in refugees and asylum seekers in a short period of time, these attitudes may change rapidly. However, little research has investigated to what extent attitudes toward this group shift over a short term. The purpose of this study with repeated cross-sectional design is to find out to what extent threat perceptions toward refugees have changed over the course of 10 months, from September/October 2017 (Time 1) to June/July 2018 (Time 2), in Flanders, Belgium. This region is chosen for its specific political and refugee context. Results indicate that perceived safety threat has increased between Time 1 and Time 2. There are no clear changes in reported realistic or symbolic threat. There are no significant gender differences, but we do find that older and lower educated respondents experience greater safety threat than younger and highly educated respondents. With these results, we contribute to a better understanding of attitude change in a volatile refugee and political context. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In this paper, we draw upon the empirical research about the social representations of the Internet in order to propose a theoretically-driven agenda. A systematic review of empirical, peer-reviewed literature was conducted. The corpus of analysis consisted of 12 papers which fell into five themes: (i) the Internet and quality of life; (ii) the Internet as a moving representation; (iii) the Internet and ageing; (iv) the Internet and mobile culture; and (v) the Internet and education. The research about the social representations of the Internet is still limited in number, depth and breadth. Notwithstanding, it conveys important insights about the evolving, symbolically-loaded meanings of the Internet as a prosthesis of knowledge and as a means of communication, with consequences for identity and intergroup relations, contributing to expand the theoretical and empirical debates on the field of digital media. The research agenda for studying the Internet from a social representations’ perspective includes three major theoretical foci: social cognition; social identity and intergroup relations; and social thinking in times of big data. Social representations can provide the field with powerful conceptual tools to learn how people deal with novelty and to navigate through huge quantity of data generated online. In change, digital media can contribute to further social representations theory developments. To learn how communication flows on the Internet and how people make sense of the Internet and Internet-related phenomena (including automatically generated contents, mass and social media accounts) equals to set the clock for the present time schedule. © 2021.

AB  - This article presents the results of three studies that examine how the perceived opinions of others are related to sexual minorities’ support for social change toward greater equality. Results of two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 1,220; Study 2: N = 904) reveal that perceived intolerance (i.e., perceived intolerant societal norms) is indirectly related to intentions to engage in collective action in both negative and positive ways: the negative effect was mediated by lower perceptions of perceived efficacy; positive effects were mediated by greater anger (about the legal situation and public opinion) and greater perceived need for a movement. Study 3 (N = 408) replicates this conflicting effect with a delayed outcome measure by showing that perceived intolerant norms were indirectly, both negatively and positively, associated with actual collective action engagement. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our expanded social identity model of collective action. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Context: Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable premature mortality in the world. Smoking is also detrimental to oral health, causing unaesthetic tooth staining, bad breath, periodontal diseases, impaired healing of wounds, increased risk of dental implant failure, precancerous conditions and oral cancer. Aims: To assess the awareness of the effects of smoking on oral health among smokers in Mangalore city and to assess the smoker's willingness to quit smoking. Settings and Design: Cross-sectional study. Material and Methods: Data was collected from 140 participants. A cross sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire to determine the sociodemographic characteristics, awareness about the effects of smoking on oral health and their willingness to participate in smoking cessation programs and to quit smoking. Results: There was statistically significant difference found in the level of awareness of the smoking effects on oral cancer, on tooth staining and dental implants. However, it was observed that the upper socioeconomic class showed a comparatively higher level of awareness than the other classes. No significant differences were found in the level of awareness of the smoking effects on gum disease and on wound healing. One hundred and thirteen individual out of 140 expressed their willingness to quit smoking and also 78 respondents showed a positive attitude toward participation in cessation programs.Conclusion: Participants in this sample had some knowledge about the effects of smoking, but were not much aware of its effect on dental implants, requiring further education. © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - A field study was conducted with majority and minority group members to test whether the effects of optimal contact conditions and of intergroup contact generalize across situations, and extend to the support of intergroup equality in terms of agreement with social policies benefitting the minority group. Participants were 163 Italian and 129 immigrant workers in three corporate organizations. Results from structural equation modelling analyses revealed that, for the majority group, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was indirectly associated, via reduction in negative stereotypes, with more positive behavior that generalized across situations. For both majority and minority groups, positive contact stemming from optimal contact conditions was associated with less negative stereotypes, and in turn with greater support for social policies favoring the minority. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, also in relation to the significance of the present results for research investigating the relation between intergroup contact and social change. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The alleged prevalence of anti-gay bias among Black communities in the United States has received ample popular and academic attention in recent decades. But just how consistent is the purported relationship between race and homophobia? In this paper, we use the American National Election Studies and the General Social Survey to show that public claims about “Black homophobia” have been dangerously overstated. Moreover, where racial differences in attitudes toward same-gender sexuality do occur, we find that the two most prevalent scholarly explanations for such gaps—religious institutions and gender ideologies—do not predict anti-gay bias for Black survey respondents. We thus derive an alternative explanation from scholarship on group threat: that perceived competition for political resources is what motivates racial differences in antagonism toward same-gender sexuality. Our results support that alternative and, in so doing, evince the importance of a relational approach to homophobia in academic and activist spheres alike. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Immigration is one of the most contested issues in contemporary political life because of its possible implications for state welfare provisions of receiving countries. There is a fear that rising immigration will erode public support for social policies that benefit immigrants, particularly in contexts of economic crisis. However, some believe that social trust is a determining factor that may mitigate such anti-immigrant attitudes. We test both arguments for the case of Spain through multiple regression analyses of surveys on attitudes towards immigrants, carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) from 2007 to 2017. While the results are consistent with expectations according to group threat theory, we also found that trusting individuals are more likely to support immigrants’ social rights. Moreover, social trust lessens the negative effects of the perception of threat posed by outgroups —perceived economic threat and perceived size of their population— on support for immigrants’ social rights. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Those on the political right engage in greater meat consumption and animal exploitation than their left-wing counterparts. Previous research suggests this is because they view vegetarianism as threatening the nation’s dietary customs and economy. Across two studies, I extend this concept of “vegetarianism threat” by showing that it separates into two distinct dimensions of concern: cultural (symbolic) threats and economic (realistic) threats. The resultant multidimensional scale allows a finer grained understanding of the roots of ideology-based threat responses to meat-free movements. Together, results implicate symbolic concerns as the key element of vegetarianism threat contributing to negative attitudes towards meat abstention and its proponents. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background Recent studies and theorizing (SD-HARM model) suggested that social dominance orientation (SDO) constitutes the ideological foundation of negative attitude towards animals and acceptance of their exploitation. At the same time, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) is expected to predict speciesist beliefs only when they are perceived as part of societal tradition. The present studies investigated these predictions with moral condemnation of harm done to animals by humans as an indicator of speciesism. Participants and procedure 400 and 324 people, aged 18-87, took part in two crosssectional studies. They reported their levels of SDO and RWA and made moral judgments of harm done to animals. Results In both studies, SDO, but not RWA, negatively predicted moral condemnation of harming animals. Conclusions The results offer additional support for the SD-HARM model. The more people accept SDO beliefs, the less they morally condemn harm done to animals by humans. © 2021 Fundacao Zoobotanica do Rio Grande do Sul. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This study is an attempt to examine the role of Pesantren (Islamic boarding schools) on social status of santri in Indonesia. The study aimed to find out what social class the santri in Pesantren are viewed by the society; to what extent they enjoy being a part of historical and cultural legacy and social setting; and how pesantren acted as a social agent to transform the social status of Kiyai and santri. Research Methodology: This research used a quantitative approach to data analysis by using questionnaires. This study has used the Smart-PLS to analyze the relations among variables. A close observation of their lifestyle and contribution to society further shows how pesantren have contributed to improving the socioeconomic status of students who had attended the pesantren. Findings: The support system and facilities at pesantren help the santri to achieve a respectable position in the society. Pesantren act as social reformers, and such educational institutions that can serve as cornerstones for bringing a change in the society. Implications for Research and Practice: Such change is compatible to scientific and ICT enabled modern infrastructural and technology-based systems. The study recommends not to consider pesantren merely as a religious school, but as a modernized institution that gives competitive knowledge, scientific approach, positive attitude and a cultural value rooted in Islamic ideology. © 2021 Ani Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The social and political implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are receiving increasing attention in the literature. This article aims to contribute to this fast-growing research programme by focusing on the degree to which Italian citizens perceive democratic institutions as effective in coping with crises like the COVID-19 emergency. We put forward a set of hypotheses whereby negative evaluations of the effectiveness of democracy can be associated with social proximity to the disease and with perceived health and economic threats. We also argued that political factors can interact with such threats. Moreover, we hypothesised that certain factors dealing with the concepts of social capital and civic culture can help inhibit negative opinions about the effectiveness of democracy. To test these hypotheses, we analysed public opinion data collected in Italy between April and July 2020 using a Rolling Cross-Section survey design. The data showed that evaluations of democracy became more negative with social proximity to the disease and with individual perceived vulnerability, understood in health and economic terms. Our findings also highlighted that certain social factors which “underpin” democracy moderated negative evaluations. Finally, political factors like ideology and government appraisal shaped the relationship between individual threats and evaluations of democracy. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Diabetes technologies, such as insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGM), have been associated with improved glycemic control and increased quality of life for young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D); however, few young people use these devices, especially those from minority ethnic groups. Current literature predominantly focuses on white patients with private insurance and does not report experiences of diverse pediatric patients with limited resources. Methods: To explore potential differences between Latinx and non-Latinx patients, English- and Spanish-speaking young people with T1D (n = 173, ages 11-25 years) were surveyed to assess attitudes about and barriers to diabetes technologies using the Technology Use Attitudes and Barriers to Device Use questionnaires. Results: Both English- and Spanish-speaking participants who identified as Latinx were more likely to have public insurance (P =.0001). English-speaking Latinx participants reported higher Hemoglobin A1c values (P =.003), less CGM use (P =.002), and more negative attitudes about technology (generally, P =.003; and diabetes-specific, P <.001) than either non-Latinx or Spanish-speaking Latinx participants. Barriers were encountered with equivalent frequency across groups. Conclusions: Latinx English-speaking participants had less positive attitudes toward general and diabetes technology than Latinx Spanish-speaking and non-Latinx English-speaking peers, and differences in CGM use were associated with socioeconomic status. Additional work is needed to design and deliver diabetes interventions that are of interest to and supportive of patients from diverse ethnic and language backgrounds. © 2021 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Previous research has linked political ideology–right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation–with more positive attitudes toward life extension. The purpose of this study was to investigate death attitudes and religious commitment as mediators of the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward life extension. College students (N = 406) completed an online survey. One death attitude–neutral acceptance–and not religious commitment mediated the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward life extension. Individuals with more intolerant political ideology may see death as aberrant and thus be more likely to embrace life extension technology. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Over the years, race-related incidents involving Greek letter organizations (GLOs), especially fraternities, continue to arise despite the ensuing controversy and negative media attention that inevitably follow such incidents. The present study examines whether there is an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes given a range of relevant psychological, sociological, and political theories about ethnoracial attitudes. Building on insights from microclass research on attitudinal structuring and drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Freshmen (N = 2,817), results of linear regression models indicate that GLO membership is associated with heightened negative ethnoracial attitudes, particularly among white male students. Moreover, a measure of ethnoracial group affiliation partially mediates this effect. This latter finding suggests that among the various ethnoracial attitude theories, group position theory may be better formulated to explain an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes, given its consideration of both ingroup boundary formation and organizations. The results also support microclass processes and suggest future research to more clearly account for pre-occupational structuring that later feeds into occupational processes. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - From early in development, humans show a strong preference for members of their own groups, even in so-called minimal (i.e., arbitrary and unfamiliar) groups, leading to tremendous negative consequences such as outgroup discrimination and derogation. A better understanding of the underlying processes driving humans’ group mindedness is an important first step toward fighting discrimination and inequality on a bigger level. Based on the assumption that minimal group allocation elicits the anticipation of future within-group cooperation, which in turn elicits ingroup preference, we investigate whether changing participants’ anticipation from within-group cooperation to between-group cooperation reduces their ingroup bias. In the present set of five studies (overall N = 465) we test this claim in two different populations (children and adults), in two different countries (United States and Germany), and in two kinds of groups (minimal and social group based on gender). Results confirm that changing participants’ anticipation of who they will cooperate with from ingroup to outgroup members significantly reduces their ingroup bias in minimal groups, though not for gender, a noncoalitional group. In summary, these experiments provide robust evidence for the hypothesis that children and adults encode minimal group membership as a marker for future collaboration. They show that experimentally manipulating this expectation can eliminate their minimal ingroup bias. This study sheds light on the underlying cognitive processes in intergroup behavior throughout development and opens up new avenues for research on reducing ingroup bias and discrimination. © 2021.

AB  - This study explored psychological predictors that may impact viewers’ decision to watch television shows on the basis of perceived racial or ethnic representation. 1998 undergraduate students selected from a list of motivations for watching television that included race-specific motivations such as “a character is of my race/ethnicity.” Participants also completed attitudinal measures of colorblind racial ideology, social dominance orientation, ethnic identity, and ethnic stigma consciousness. Analysis revealed that prejudicial beliefs predicted less salience for racial representation when making choices about television watching, while deeper connection to one’s ethnic group predicted greater salience for representation when making these choices. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Immigration policymaking has been active at the local level in the United States over the past few decades. This study examines whether the economic development-oriented immigrant-welcoming efforts that started in 2010 in Detroit have increased the local immigrant population. It uses the synthetic control method to construct a comparison region that resembles Detroit in the preintervention periods to serve as a counterfactual. Empirical results reveal a statistically significant increase in the immigrant share of the population in the metropolitan area during the postintervention period of 2011–2014. The increase is robust to various sets of specifications and placebo tests. The share of high-skilled immigrants in the local population also increased during this time, albeit with a weak statistical significance. These findings point to the potential of immigrant-welcoming programs in attracting and retaining immigrants and immigrant talent. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - When analyzing the relationship between individual religiosity and attitudes toward immigration, empirical research often leads to contrasting findings. By focusing on contemporary Italy, our contribution aims to provide evidence of two opposite effects that religiosity can exert on attitudes toward immigration. On the one hand, belonging to a religious community is expected to reinforce a social identity, leading to negative attitudes toward outgroups. On the other hand, religious commitment implies adhering to religious teachings which promote altruistic values, such as the acceptance of others. Since the two hypotheses pertain to different dimensions of religiosity, we propose to use a typology combining affiliation and church attendance, so that the two hypotheses can be tested as complementary. The first evidence we provide to support the hypotheses analyzes parallel survey data coming from the European Social Survey (ESS), the European Values Study (EVS), and the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). In particular, we point out that non-religious and highly religious people show more positive attitudes toward immigration than affiliated individuals with low religious commitment. Moreover, data from the 2018 ISSP module “Religion IV”, which includes more specific measures of religious identity and commitment, lend further support to our expectations. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study aims at shedding light on the portrayal of the Hispanic-American experience in Judith Ortiz Cofer's novel First Person Fiction: Call Me Maria (2004), emphasizing the ways in which Cofer represents her adolescent protagonist, Maria, who manages to forge a bicultural identity in multicultural America. How the protagonist responds to oppression and inequality and how the family and society are responsible for shaping one's cultural identity are main questions to be answered in this study. More specifically, the paper draws on the theoretical tenets by Charles Taylor in his essay "The Politics of Recognition"in which he states the main issues related to the politics of multiculturalism. He focuses on the demand for recognition and dialogue in the formation of identity for ethnic minorities. Furthermore, the paper highlights the cardinal role that language, parent-child relationship, and school play in the formation of the protagonist's identity. It concludes that Maria's positive attitude towards her cultural heritage and past as a Puerto Rican-American girl helps her to overcome all the obstacles she faces in a multiethnic society. Ultimately, she managed to fulfill her dream as a poet, reach self-recognition, and construct her identity as equal and unique. © 2021 DSR Publishers/The University of Jordan. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This paper focuses on the irregular migration flow from the United States to Canada from 2017 to 2020. This irregular migration, defined as unauthorized border crossings, challenges a central tenet of the perceived exceptionalism of Canadian immigration policy by illustrating that while legal migration remains publicly popular and receives political support, the public rejects unwanted, irregular, or illegal migration, demanding strong response from the Canadian government. The 2017–2020 irregular migration of refugee claimants from the United States generated discord in a number of public and political settings. Debates existed over the terminology for unauthorized border crossings, public opinion was divided, and prior to the 2019 Canadian federal election, political parties developed different and opposing positions. Disagreement over costs and funding for the settlement of irregular migrants emerged at city, provincial, and federal levels. The federal government subsequently amended immigration legislation and increased budgets for border control activities. © 2021 ACSUS.

AB  - Nationwide lockdowns implemented by governments to confront the COVID-19 pandemic came at a high economic price. The article investigates citizens’ evaluation of the trade-off between public health measures and their economic consequences. Using a vignette experiment conducted in June 2020 on 7,500 respondents in seven European countries the article tests whether perceived threats of the health and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic affect citizens’ preferences for strict or mild lockdown measures. Findings show that European citizens tend to prefer strict measures protecting public health despite their damage to the economy. Even individuals more concerned about the pandemic’s economic impact do not prefer milder restrictions. Sociodemographic factors only indirectly affect public preferences, through perceived threats. Additionally, findings show that trust in experts and political orientations matter. These results resonate with previous research showing that public opinion in hard times is likely to be guided by risk perceptions and subjective attitudes.

AB  - Whereas European countries received more than a million refugees in 2015 alone, the United States admitted just over a half million that year and only 25,782 in 2019, following limits placed by the Trump administration. The rhetoric surrounding the alleged dangers migrants pose pushed the issue to the front of the political agenda in Europe and the United States, resulting in significant shifts in public opinion. Based on five similar surveys conducted in four European countries (N = 6,000) and in the United States (N = 1,031), this study focuses on how perceptions of migrant deservingness might be affected by television news exposure and perceived threat. The findings indicate that in Europe, exposure to public news is associated with lower threat perceptions and greater deservingness, whereas exposure to commercial news is associated with higher threat perceptions and lower deservingness. In the United States, exposure to CNN is associated with lower threat perceptions and greater deservingness, but exposure to Fox News is associated with greater threat perceptions and lower deservingness. The study also found that realistic threat plays a greater role than symbolic threat in lowering public perceptions of deservingness in the United States, whereas the reverse is true in Europe. © 2021.

AB  - The study examined the subjective ethnolinguistic vitality of an Iban community in Sarawak, Malaysia based on their language use and attitudes. A survey of 200 respondents in the Song district was conducted. To determine the objective ethnolinguistic vitality, a structural analysis was performed on their sociolinguistic backgrounds. The results show the Iban language dominates in family, friendship, transactions, religious, employment, and education domains. The language use patterns show functional differentiation into the Iban language as the “low language” and Malay as the “high language”. The respondents have positive attitudes towards the Iban language. The dimensions of language attitudes that are strongly positive are use of the Iban language, Iban identity, and intergenerational transmission of the Iban language. The marginally positive dimensions are instrumental use of the Iban language, social status of Iban speakers, and prestige value of the Iban language. Inferential statistical tests show that language attitudes are influenced by education level. However, language attitudes and use of the Iban language are not significantly correlated. By viewing language use and attitudes from the perspective of ethnolinguistic vitality, this study has revealed that a numerically dominant group assumed to be safe from language shift has only medium vitality, based on both objective and subjective evaluation. © 2021.

AB  - There are growing concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic is strengthening nationalism around the world by fueling discrimination, unilateralism, and economic crises. However, there have been few empirical analyses of the effect of the pandemic on individuals’ level of nationalism. Using evidence from two original surveys conducted in Canada in 2019 and 2020, I show that public support for international economic integration has increased rather than decreased since the outbreak of the pandemic. The survey data point to economic anxiety induced by the pandemic as a key mechanism shaping individuals’ attitudes towards international economic integration. While the existing literature has found that negative economic sentiment depresses support for international economic integration, economic anxiety appears to be positively related to support for integration in the COVID-19 era. My findings therefore run counter to current arguments about the effect of the pandemic and to expectations based on the existing literature. Gaining a better empirical understanding of the relationship between the pandemic and nationalism in public opinion is particularly important at a time when international cooperation is needed to address both COVID-19 and its economic effects. © 2021 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.

AB  - The research aims to examine the shared effect of tourism in Aqaba and the Jordanian host culture. Despite the presence of preferences and developments in tourism opportunities and problems, despite the fact that these circumstances are marked by, uncertainty, and personal shifts, the local community's behaviour and attitudes towards the tourism industry are highly dependent on them. A questionnaire was circulated to a group of (1200) people living in Aqaba to accomplish this goal. From 1/1/2019 until 30/12/2019, the allocation and restitution took one year, taking into account the low and high tourism seasons. In order to assess the most important facets of the socio-cultural and economic impacts of tourism in these regions, the questionnaire was circulated to the survey participants in order to measure attitudes towards tourism. This analysis is an exploratory, empirical study that follows the process of obtaining and reviewing knowledge to draw conclusions. To assess the degree of significance for the study questions, the researchers used the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, T-test and ANOVA test. The findings revealed that the economic sub-scale was the highest degree of attitudes towards tourism, while the lowest was the social sub-scale. This research provides a better understanding of the social and cultural effects of tourism and the host culture in Jordan, in order to establish a holistic growth of sustainable tourism in Aqaba. It is possible to submit and further test the new model at another destination in Jordan. © 2021 Editura Universitatii din Oradea. All rights reserved.

AB  - The vast literature on negative treatment of outgroups and favoritism toward ingroups provides many local insights but is largely fragmented, lacking an overarching framework that might provide a unified overview and guide conceptual integration. As a result, it remains unclear where different local perspectives conflict, how they may reinforce one another, and where they leave gaps in our knowledge of the phenomena. Our aim is to start constructing a framework to help remedy this situation. We first identify a few key ideas for creating a theoretical roadmap for this complex territory, namely the principles of etiological functionalism and the dual inheritance theory of human evolution. We show how a “molecular” approach to emotions fits into this picture, and use it to illuminate emotions that shape intergroup relations. Finally, we weave the pieces together into the beginnings of a systematic taxonomy of the emotions involved in social interactions, both hostile and friendly. While it is but a start, we have developed the argument in a way that illustrates how the foundational principles of our proposed framework can be extended to accommodate further cases. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: An end date for smoking has been adopted in several countries and is now being discussed by governments all over the world. However, little is known about temporal changes in citizens' support for a future smoking ban. Aim: To examine temporal changes in support for a future smoking ban and for increasing taxes on tobacco in Denmark, and to explore whether these changes differ across sex, age, educational attainment, smoking status and between smokers with/without intention to quit. Method: The study was based on two waves of 'The Danish Capital Region Health Survey' conducted in 2013 and 2017. The pooled study sample included 96 521 citizens aged ≥16 years old. Results: Public support for a future smoking ban increased from 30.6% in 2013 to 50.3% in 2017, whereas support for increasing tobacco taxes remained unchanged at 59%. Support for a future smoking ban increased significantly in almost all subgroups from 2013 to 2017: Support among daily smokers increased by 27% between 2013 and 2017. Support among never smokers was almost 2.63 times higher than among smokers in 2013 and increased further in 2017 (OR: 2013=2.63; 2017=5.13). Conclusion: This study indicates a readiness to support a future smoking ban and increasing tobacco taxes. Support for a future smoking ban has increased from 2013 to 2017 among both young people and adults. By 2017, about half of the population supported a future smoking ban and increasing tobacco taxes. Findings may help inform policy-making related to endgame strategies. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.

AB  - Relationships among sports, physical activity (PA) participation, and educational outcomes have been studied in various venues, however, used a longitudinal method with a national sample of Asian-American High-School Students (AAHSS) was barely covered. This study employed the latest National High-School Longitudinal Study data (Participants, N = 950); hierarchical regression modeling and intersectionality theory examined, analyzed, and evaluated the relationships among sports, PA participation, and the outcomes on the physical education grade point average (Phys-Ed GPA). Moreover, the demographics factors impact on the participants' Phys-Ed GPA was also analyzed and evaluated. The primary results included: 1) the female students who participate in Organized Sports had a higher Phys-Ed GPA, and that relationship was true for male students with the exception that this relationship is not statistically significant once demographic variables are added to the model. 2) Hours Spent on Extracurricular Activities had no effect on Phys-Ed GPA for both male and female students. 3) The impact of Academic Behavior was positive and robust, that is, to female and male participants, the higher the Academic Behavior the higher the Phys-Ed GPA. 4) Having Pride in one’s school had a positive relationship with the Phys-Ed GPA for the female students; however, no significant effect for the male students; and etc. Our findings confirmed and reinforced the importance of participating in sports and PA in fostering positive attitude toward which resulting better Phys-Ed GPA, and other educational outcomes for the Asian-American high school students. Our investigation further explains the importance of redistributing social structures in order to create equal educational opportunities for Asian American communities and their children, all of these may provide meaningful information or a scientific basis for the policymakers to make future policy. © 2021, Editura Universitatii din Pitesti.

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to develop and test a model of digital health communication media (DHCM) use for healthy food information – DHCM usage – during the Covid-19 pandemic. More specifically, this research investigated the simultaneous effects of perceived threat of Covid-19, e-health literacy, attitude toward DHCM usage, knowledge toward DHCM usage, facilitating conditions and information quality on the DHCM usage. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical data were collected through a survey. The respondents of the survey are 192 DHCM users who lived in Tangerang Regency. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was performed. Findings: The DHCM usage during the Covid-19 pandemic is significantly affected by the attitude towards the DHCM usage and the facilitating conditions. However, the DHCM usage during the Covid-19 pandemic is not significantly affected by the perceived threat of Covid-19, e-health literacy, information quality and knowledge of the DHCM usage. Research limitations/implications: This research was conducted only in Tangerang Regency and employed a purposive sampling technique. Future research should be conducted in other contexts to examine the stability of the research findings. Practical implications: In order to improve DHCM usage for healthy food information, it is important for building a positive attitude towards DHCM usage and ensuring the availability of the facilitating conditions. Originality/value: This paper is the first that develops and tests a model of DHCM usage for healthy food information during the Covid-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak in Europe has brought attention to EU health policy as a focal point for solidarity, particularly as it concerns access to medicines. Against the backdrop of policy proposals for EU joint procurement of medicines, this article expands our understanding of public opinion towards this particular aspect of European integration. Drawing on data from a conjoint experiment in five EU countries, the study investigates the extent to which citizens’ preferences concerning alternative policy designs for EU joint procurement of medicines are either structured along a pro-EU versus anti-EU or ideological divide, or are crisis driven by the perceived COVID-19 threat. The analysis reveals that individual preferences over the design of EU risk pooling for medicines are most strongly explained by Euroscepticism, while egalitarian ideology plays only a modest role. How citizens’ perceived threat of COVID-19 affects their preferences for this form of EU risk pooling is dependent on the national context. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The racial gradient hypothesis of comparative conflict theory predicts Black people perceive the greatest social injustices, followed by Latinx and white people, respectively. This study used nationally representative data collected prior to George Zimmerman’s arrest to examine whether racial groups (Black, Latinx, white) differed in their perceptions that Zimmerman was guilty of a crime against Trayvon Martin. Logistic regression results revealed Black participants were 98% more likely than white participants to perceive Zimmerman as guilty. Latinx perceptions of Zimmerman’s guilt did not significantly differ from those of Black or white participants. Findings suggest some Latinx individuals may not fully appreciate how the same U.S. racial hierarchy that harms Latinx communities also works to produce anti-Black violence. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Why might some meat-eaters and meat-avoiders express negative attitudes toward each other? We investigated intergroup attitudes and potential underpinnings of these attitudes across three different dietary groups—veg*ans (vegetarians and vegans), flexitarians (people who restrict their meat intake partially), and meat-eaters—in Turkey (NStudy 1 = 366; NStudy 2 = 450). In both studies, veg*ans showed the greatest ingroup favouritism and reported the highest ingroup identification and perceived discrimination. Meat enjoyment, moral consideration, and perceived veg*an threat (among meat-eaters) predicted dietary ingroup identification in Study 1, whereas perceived discrimination towards one’s dietary group was the strongest predictor of identification among all dietary groups in Study 2. Among meat-avoiders, but not among meat-eaters, stronger dietary ingroup identification was associated with more negative outgroup attitudes. Findings are discussed in light of social identity theories and intergroup perspectives. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article offers a state of the art of research on migration policies, participation and the political construction of immigration in Spain. It starts with an overview of migration policy, addressing the impact of the 2008 economic crisis on the configuration of the political agenda. Secondly, it addresses the political participation of immigrants in Spain and their role as “new” voters. Finally, the appearance of the extreme right political party VOX has shifted the classic debates on the attitudes of the population towards immigration and built a new anti-immigration discourse. The article argues that academic interest and scientific production have been modulated in line with the various phases of Spain’s configuration as a country of immigration. The text ends with some reflections on the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, which has opened up a period of major challenge and uncertainty. © 2021

AB  - Drawing on the rejection-identification (Branscombe et al., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 1999, 77, 135) and rejection-disidentification (Jasinskaja-Lahti et al., Applied Psychology: An International Review, 2009, 58, 105) models, we examined the effects of national identity misrecognition on attitudes toward the French mainstream society among Maghrebi-French and Muslim minority group members. We conducted a survey (N = 190) and two experiments (N = 103; 190), in which we measured and manipulated, respectively, the feeling of misrecognition (i.e., having one’s national identity denied by the mainstream). Results showed that national identity misrecognition is a concept different from other forms of rejection by the majority group (i.e., perceived discrimination) (Studies 1 and 2). We also showed that feelings of misrecognition were related to higher hostility toward the mainstream (Studies 1 and 3) and higher identification with the national group (Study 3). In the discussion, we highlight the need for public policies to implement preventive actions against this form of rejection within French society. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Social media has a role to play in shaping the dynamic relations between immigrants and citizens. This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N = 310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants’ opinion expression via Facebook posts (N = 146,332) discussing immigrants. Automated linguistic analyses reveal that self-reported survey measures correlate with the expressive use of social media for discussing immigrants. Higher anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with higher negative sentiment, anger, and swear words in discussing immigrants. The findings highlight the need to pay attention to the combined influence of social media use and individual political beliefs when analyzing intergroup relations. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2021.

AB  - Background: Dispensing separation (DS) is a critical policy change that will reduce medical costs, improve population health and increase the quality of healthcare in Malaysia. This study aims to determine the awareness and perception of the public regarding the DS methods. Methods: This cross-sectional study uses a pre-validated, self-administered questionnaire, which has been administered to 200 residents in Jitra, Kedah, Malaysia. Descriptive and inferential statistics have been used to analyse the data. Results: Females formed 64.0% of the participants, with Malay being the dominant ethnic group (n = 167, 83.5%); 77.5% of the participants reported they were aware of the role of pharmacists in the healthcare system. However, 35.0% of the participants reported having never heard the term ‘dispensing separation’ in any mainstream media in Malaysia, whereas 73.5% of the participants reported that a pharmacist was more reliable than a physician in providing medicines once the diagnosis had been made and 77.5% of them acknowledged that pharmacists were experts in the field of medication. There was a significant association between the participant’s awareness and the agreement on perceptions toward the implementation of the DS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Awareness of the implementation of DS among residents in Jitra is still low. However, there is strong evidence of public support and the benefits of DS in Malaysia. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2021.

AB  - Although anti-immigrant attitudes continue to be expressed around the world, identifying these attitudes as prejudice, truth or free speech remains contested. This contestation occurs, in part, because of the absence of consensually agreed-upon understandings of what prejudice is. In this context, the current study sought to answer the question, “what do people understand to be prejudice?” Participants read an intergroup attitude expressed by a member of their own group (an “in-group” member) or another group (an “out-group” member). This was followed by an interpretation of the attitude as either “prejudiced” or “free speech.” This interpretation was also made by in-group or an out-group member. Subsequent prejudice judgements were influenced only by the group membership of the person expressing the initial attitude: the in-group member's attitude was judged to be less prejudiced than the identical attitude expressed by an out-group member. Participants' judgements of free speech, however, were more complex: in-group attitudes were seen more as free speech than out-group attitudes, except when an in-group member interpreted those attitudes as prejudice. These data are consistent with the Social Identity Approach to intergroup relations, and have implications for the processes by which intergroup attitudes become legitimised as free speech instead of prejudice. © 2021 International Union of Psychological Science

AB  - Although the number of Chinese immigrants moving to South Korea has increased in the past decade Koreans still hold negative attitudes toward China and the Chinese populace. To discover whether this prejudice can be reduced, we examined the effect of direct contact with Chinese people on Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people. Participants in our study were 91 Korean university students who were divided into two groups based on their contact experience with people from China. The contact group (n = 43) and the noncontact group (n = 48) both completed a cultural experience questionnaire, the Explicit Attitude Questionnaire, and the Implicit Association Test. According to the results, the contact group displayed more positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people than did the noncontact group. These findings suggest that it may be possible to improve Koreans' perception of China and relations with Chinese people by increasing direct contact experience between the two communities. © 2021 Scientific Journal Publishers Limited.

AB  - The perceived sexual threat of ethnic outgroups has been argued to contribute to anti-immigrant attitudes within societies. The current study investigates to what extent news media might contribute to such negative outgroup perceptions by analyzing implicit sexual threat associations in Dutch news. The study draws on a sample of more than two million news articles published between 2008 and 2018 in five major Dutch newspapers. To identify implicit bias in this corpus, we use word embeddings—an advanced language modeling technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The results show that ethnic outgroups (i.e., nationalities that were most prominently represented among asylum applications in the Netherlands during the refugee crisis) are associated more strongly with sexual threat than ethnic ingroups. These findings proved robust across a diverse set of outgroups and ingroup nationalities and names, and point to the existence of considerable implicit bias in the coverage of ethnic minorities. Moreover, the sexual threat associated with Arabic names has grown stronger since the “refugee crisis”. Such implicit biases reflect and potentially reinforces individuals’ implicit associations between ethnic minorities and sexual threat, potentially explaining growing anti-immigration attitudes, especially since the refugee crisis. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In the debate concerning environmental protection issues there is a clash between the positions held by the advocates of anthropocentric and eco-bio-centric environmental ethics. Although wildlife conservators criticize anthropocentrism as the main cause behind the ecological crisis, (1) its structure as a psychological construct underlying the anthropocentric orientation is unclear and (2) there is no psychometrically adequate measure of anthropocentrism that would allow for determining its relations to other constructs. To fill this gap, we conducted two studies. The concept of anthropocentrism, understood as including the finalistic, metaphysical, epistemological, and axiological aspects distinguished in the philosophical debate, was operationalized as the Anthropocentric Beliefs Scale (ABS). Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) of the results of Studies 1 and 2 showed that anthropocentrism was a one-dimensional construct. Study 2 also revealed that it was negatively related to environmental attitudes and positively related to negative attitudes toward robots, centrality of religiosity, and right-wing authoritarianism. The construct validity and measurement reliability of the ABS were supported. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - What factors shape European opinion on immigration? Past work has largely pointed to evaluations of various immigrant groups and the cultural, criminal, and/or economic threats they may pose to society, but has overlooked how evaluations of the broader political system matter. Using cross-sectional and panel data from the European Social Survey (ESS), we find that higher levels of political trust are associated with increased public support for allowing a variety of different groups to immigrate, including non-Europeans, Muslims, and Roma. We also find that political trust is positively associated with support for a generous and accommodating refugee policy. We attribute these findings to greater mass confidence in the political system’s ability to protect the native population from any perceived immigration-related threats. Overall, these findings suggest that political trust, which is near historic lows, has important implications for understanding public opinion toward immigration, a highly salient issue in contemporary European politics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Individual attitudes towards immigration are powerfully driven by ethnic context, that is, size of foreign-born population. We advance the literature by examining how the change (growth) in foreign-born population, in addition to its size (level), is related to two distinct outcomes: natives’ views on legal and unauthorized immigration. By analysing a probability US sample, we find that an increase in the state-level immigration population is positively related to Americans’ approval of a policy aimed at containing the flow of undocumented immigrants. The proportion of immigrants in a state, however, is not a significant predictor of support for such restrictive policy. With respect to legal immigration, neither the amount of recent change in, nor the size of, the immigration population matters. Our study provides strong evidence for contextual effects: net of compositional factors, a dynamic change in foreign-born population has an independent impact on how Americans view unauthorized, but not legal, immigration. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Assimilation and integration processes have been studied widely and for many years, mainly by looking at the attitudes and practices of people with migration background. This article focusses on the mirror group: the people without migration background. Based on a literature review we propose a new model, the Diversity Attitudes and Practices Impact (DAPI) scales, to assess the impact they have on inclusion and exclusion in ethnically diverse contexts. We test the model using new data on Rotterdam, a superdiverse majority minority city with a large share of voters for anti-immigrant parties. Though the attention, both in research and in the public debate, is focussed on the rise of anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe and the United States, the outcomes of our DAPI-scales model demonstrate that, counter to what is expected, the most probable trend in Rotterdam is towards more socio-economic inclusion and more openness to cultural diversity. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Self-identities and social identities on ageing are constructed on the basis of 'conditions' and 'experiences' in the life of the aged. Using Bourdieu's Theory of Habitus, the study tried to understand the dialectics of self and social identity constructions on subjective well being and quality of life of aged women. Qualitative analysis using narratives and photo-elicitation method was used. The study consisted of 14 elderly women aged 70 years and above living in Kerala. Results showed that perceptions about age identity have both direct and indirect impact on subjective well being. Corresponding to the nature of self-identity, both positive and negative influences are observed. Disengagements from active roles and power positions, attitude towards old age as a definite period of dependency, belief in the inevitability of ill health, pessimism about cure for health problems, fear and anxiety about miseries and unpredictability in life were the leading self-identity statements. Identity constructions, when used deliberately as a tool of oppression, results in Reverse Metamorphosis. Unlike biological metamorphosis- where the process brings life to an active, vibrant, beautiful stage till the end of life, in Reverse Metamorphosis, aged women enter into cocoons of identities and images that label their life as passive, inactive, shadeless and unattractive. Gender and widowhood add to the process by setting limits to the conditions of life. Reverse metamorphosis is reinforced through marginalisation, isolation, neglect and abuse leading to depression, poor subjective well being and reduced quality of life. Suggestions are made to use Social, Cultural, Economic and Symbolic Capitals envisaged by Bourdieu to influence the identity constructions, explore designs for Inclusive Social Spaces and gender sensitisation to reduce ageism. © 2021 SCMS Group of Educational Institutions.

AB  - The transmission of national history in general and family narratives in particular is prone to censorship and bias, protecting or enhancing social identities. The authors propose that, as has been shown for national groups, families also create and pass on representations about their roles and behaviors through history. In a representative survey, 1000 German respondents estimated the percentages of victims, perpetrators, and those who helped potential victims during the time of National Socialism to be 35%, 34%, and 16%, respectively. For family representations, the percentages shifted toward helping (29%) and away from complicity (20%), while representations of victimhood were as prevalent (36%) as estimates for the general population. Systematic differences suggested an alignment of general social representations of history with family representations. Participants reporting a perpetrator family representation held more positive attitudes toward refugees coming to Germany today than participants who did not report such a representation. This link was mediated through differences in societal representations. The authors discuss family representations as an intermediate, more proximate prescriptive background and points of reference, according to which more general historical representations on a national level may be aligned, and individual present-day political attitudes and behaviors oriented. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Today, turning to the quality of life and the use of spiritual and health attitudes have become one of the communities’ concerns. This study aimed to determine a structural model of urban quality of life (UQL) based on socioeconomic status (SES), religious attitude, and mental health status among Iranian Muslims. The sample included 383 individuals (256 females and 179 males) from Yazd selected by multi-stage cluster sampling method. The subjects responded to the demographic form, Urban Quality of Life Scale-47 (UQLS-47), the Religion Assessment Questionnaire-26 (RAQ-26), and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). The results showed that SES and religious attitude were negatively associated with mental health and positively associated with UQL. Also, mental health negatively associated with UQL and has the role of a mediating variable. This means that three variables (SES, religious attitude and mental health) can predict a 0.45 variance of UQL. The findings are in line with similar studies. So, Iranian Muslims have better mental health and SES in society and a more positive attitude toward religion and spirituality; they will have better UQL. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Desecration of national symbols is a recurring societal phenomenon that can lead to highly defensive reactions from some citizens, especially on the part of those expressing a strong attachment to the nation. In this paper, we investigated the effects of blind and constructive patriotism when faced with an ingroup (vs. outgroup) national flag burning on ingroup bias, taking into consideration the mediating role of perceived threat. In two studies (N = 252), the level of blind patriotism predicted stronger ingroup bias—due to more negative evaluation of visible minorities and/or more positive evaluation of the ingroup—when another ingroup member burnt an ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag. This effect was partly mediated by a greater threat to the group’s image perceived by blindly patriotic people when the ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag was burnt (Study 2). Study 2 also highlighted a main effect of the symbol: ingroup bias was stronger when the ingroup (vs. outgroup) flag was burnt. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the role played by modes of national attachment and the consequences of desecrating symbols. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - In debates about migration in Western countries, citizens concerns about immigrant groups often go hand in hand with concerns about the decline of society as a whole. Societal discontent, however, is a distinct concept and may have its own relations with immigration attitudes, over and above the role of perceived immigrant threat. In a survey of a representative sample of Dutch people (N = 1239), we disentangled societal discontent from intergroup threat with respect to their relationship with different kinds of action intentions regarding refugees (both pro and anti) and intentions regarding the government. Unsurprisingly, societal discontent predicted support for anti-government protest (which was strikingly high). More importantly, societal discontent independently predicted both pro-refugee and anti-refugee action intentions, over and above intergroup threat. These associations were moderated by intergroup threat: only when refugees were experienced as a threat did discontent predict anti-refugee action intentions. On the other hand, societal discontent predicted more pro-refugee action intentions, but only when people experienced refugees as an enrichment. Thus, despite populist rhetoric, societal discontent is not always tied to anti-immigrant actions. This suggests that refugee sentiments and societal discontent are not exchangeable: societal discontent plays an important role in reactions to immigration. © 2021 Ubiquity Press.

AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy presents an obstacle to the campaign to control COVID-19. It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms, and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. Methods An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18 to 75, between 21 Nov and 21 Dec 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. Results Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19, and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity, and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, while the effect associated with education is reversed. Conclusions Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regard to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy. However, vaccine hesitancy associated with age and gender does not appear to be explained by other predictor variables tested here. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - The contemporary integration policies (Community Cohesion Agenda [CCA]) of the United Kingdom have been criticized for their foundational weaknesses, conceptual inadequacies, myopic views with regard to the complexity of the issue, lack of evidence, and so on. Vast majority of the studies conducted to verify this discourse have been done in the line of theoretical arguments of diversity management rather than exploring their connections to a target community in reality. This study aims at establishing a linkage between the growing theoretical arguments of the integration discourse with empirical data in light of the policy framework of the CCA. We have selected the fastest growing Bangladeshi community of the CCA-adapted Aston City of Birmingham as the representative group of the ethnic minority communities of the United Kingdom. Qualitative data collection approach has been followed, where primary in-depth interviews were conducted on various policy actors, social workers, faith leaders, and Bangladeshi residents of Aston. The entire policy instrument, starting from its broad purposes to operational strategies, has been severely challenged by both residents of the community and relevant policy-implementing bodies in Aston. CCA policies appear to be largely inclined toward the interculturalism/communitarianism ideology rather than to multiculturalism. However, the empirical evidence shows that the need for multiculturalism, to be more specific—Bristol School of Multiculturalism, as a political theory remains in the integration discourse in the context of the United Kingdom. Findings are expected to have implications on practitioners and policy makers in designing diversity management policy instruments by having a wider synthesized view on both theoretical argument and empirical data. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Support for marriage equality (i.e. extending the privilege of marriage beyond heterosexual couples) is gaining global momentum as evidenced by the increase of countries introducing related legislation, yet little research has attempted to understand factors predicting the rejection of marriage equality. In this paper, we explore the multi-faceted role of religion in explaining the relationship between sexual prejudice and the rejection of marriage equality. Specifically, we explored the role of religious affiliation (i.e. religious-group membership; Study 1: n= 81) and multiple forms of religiosity (i.e. trait-like conceptualisations; Study 2: n= 168) in explaining the rejection of marriage equality beyond variance accounted for by simple sexual prejudice. As expected, negative attitudes towards marriage equality were related to being higher in sexual prejudice and religious fundamentalism, being lower in Quest, and being Christian (vs. non-religious). In addition, both religious fundamentalism and intrinsic religiosity moderated the marriage equality rejection-sexual prejudice relationship. Importantly, in multiple regression analyses, religious affiliation did not predict the rejection of marriage equality, and religious fundamentalism was the only significant religiosity predictor. Taken together, religiosity emerged as a more useful quantification of religion than religious affiliation in the context of explaining the rejection of marriage equality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article analyzes the securitization of the political space under the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi (Justice and Development Party, AKP) governments in Turkey with a critical feminist lens. We argue that a feminist reading unpacks the connection between AKP’s discursive strategies in the spheres of social and national security. We focus on the AKP’s proposals that address social policy and defense policy spheres—namely, the “Women’s Employment Package;” “Family Package;” and “Internal Security Package.” In our analysis, we start from the argument that the AKP’s terms in office represent the last phase of neoliberal transformation in the country. Packages in this phase also speak to the patchwork style of neoliberal policy making. They function as means for checking, and then, manipulating public opinion. Analysis of the packages provides insight into the AKP’s increasing resort to violence vis-á-vis opposition as well as the deepening of the economic crisis in the country in the last two decades. © 2021, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

AB  - The potential threat posed by returning and repatriated foreign fighters and the upcoming release of homegrown violent extremists from prisons in developed democracies has raised interest in terrorist rehabilitation programs. Few studies, however, systematically examine how the public views such programs. Drawing on research on public attitudes toward prisoner reentry in criminology and social psychological theory, this study offers a series of hypotheses about support for rehabilitation programming for terrorist offenders. These hypotheses are then tested through a survey experiment on a nationally representative sample of 1,021 adult citizens in the United States. The results show that the public is less supportive of postrelease rehabilitation programming for terrorists than other criminal offenders. Support is also lower when an Islamist, rather than a white nationalist, offender is referenced. Support increases when a referenced Islamist is described as a juvenile convicted of a less serious offense. Men, younger individuals, those with some college education, and self-identified liberals are more likely to support terrorist rehabilitation programming. Finally, irrespective of treatment, respondents are most likely to cite evidence of effectiveness as the factor that would increase their support for rehabilitation programming. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - We examined the dynamics through which temporary motor cues of approach or avoidance directed to an outgroup member affect attitudes of majority members toward the minority outgroup. In Study 1 participants activated and maintained either arm flexion or arm extension, while facing a picture of an outgroup person wearing religious trappings. Thereafter, they filled a questionnaire which measured outgroup prejudice. Study 2 replicated this procedure while including a control condition of the arm, and measured intergroup anxiety in addition to prejudice. In the first study outgroup prejudice was significantly higher following arm extension in comparison with arm flexion. The second study revealed that the source of the arm activation effect was due to arm extension increasing prejudice rather than arm flexion reducing it. Moreover, a mediation effect was found: Arm extension (vs. control) increased intergroup anxiety, which in turn was related to higher prejudice toward the outgroup. The results reveal embodiment effects by which temporary motor cues are related to visual religious cues leading to subsequent bias toward the outgroup. Multimodal representation accounts and theories explaining the psychological processes involved in perceiving threat-cues in intergroup relations are discussed. Practical implications of the observed embodied effects are also considered © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - The Ethio-Eritrea border war, which took place from 1998–2000, was not formally resolved until the signing of a peace declaration on 9 July 2018. Known as a ‘fight between two bald men over a comb’, this conflict has long puzzled social scientists and political analysts. While the two countries provided different explanations for the conflict to rally public support and justify the price of war, the author argues that the conflict exceeded the logics of territorial integrity. Rather, he contends that given the colonial legacy of intentionally instituting borders to divide communities and ethnic groups, it is not possible to fully understand the border dispute without accounting for the transnational nature of the ruling ethnic groups. This is because the border and ethnic conflicts that have characterised post-colonial Africa have usually been linked to the creation of inter-ethnic groups, intra-ethnic competition and artificial boundaries between neighbouring nation-states. The Ethio-Eritrea border dispute is best understood through the lens of an ethno-linguistic struggle for supremacy disguised as a patriotic campaign against invaders. The paper concludes by reflecting on the durability of the 2018 peace declaration. © 2021 King’s College London.

AB  - Current research supports the idea that attitudes toward animals, including their rights and treatment, relate to other social and ideological views. In this study, I explored whether attitudes toward animals relate to wider ideological beliefs and important social identities in Serbia. I conducted two surveys to identify these relationships. In the first study, a sample (n = 321) from the general population completed a questionnaire asking about their attitudes toward animals, their acceptance of authority and societal order (right-wing authoritarianism), their preference for social hierarchy (social dominance orientation), and the importance of their social identities (gender, ethnicity, religion). I found that participants who were less supportive of animal rights also endorsed authoritarianism and relations of social dominance between groups to a larger extent. Furthermore, those who identified more strongly with gender, ethnicity, and religion also expressed more negative attitudes toward animals. In the second study, I surveyed undergraduate students in Serbia (n = 207) to determine the role of ethnic attachment as an ideological basis for attitudes toward animals. Perceptions of vegetarianism as an alternative lifestyle and a threat to the local traditions mediated the effects of ethnic attachment on both attitudes toward animals and meat consumption. However, this was true only for participants who prioritized group needs over individual needs (collectivists). In contrast, those with individualist views were more likely to endorse discrimination on the basis of species, regardless of their ethnocentrism. The findings show that attitudes toward animals correlated with endorsement of social hierarchies and with valuing the superiority of the ethnic ingroup. Attitudes toward animals thus relate to wider ideological views, in particular perceiving vegetarianism as a threat to the traditional values. I also discuss the implications of the findings for the study of human–animal relations. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

AB  - It is widely acknowledged that the economic situation is of vital importance for the stability of an authoritarian regime, but it is rarely known how the public’s economic evaluation contributes to such outcomes. This study examines the effects of citizens’ retrospective and prospective evaluations of their household economic situation and the national economy on the level of regime support in China. The findings show that the national economy outweighs household economic conditions in its effects on the public’s support of the regime. However, the gap between evaluations of the national economy and individual economic situations debilitates regime support. The population in different age cohorts has distinct patterns of relationships between retrospective and prospective economic evaluations and regime support. This study elucidates the political-psychological mechanism of the public’s economic evaluation affecting regime support, and the ruling strategy in authoritarian regimes of manipulating this evaluation. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The popularity of companion animals in South Korea has increased rapidly in recent years. However, the injection of companion animals with unprescribed vaccines or antibiotic treatments by their owners without veterinary consultation has emerged as a serious animal welfare concern. To develop strategies for addressing this issue, first it is necessary to understand the determinants of such behavior. We considered that direct questioning of dog owners via a survey about their experiences of administering injections would be unreliable, hence an exploration of the determinants of owners’ opinions about self-administered injections was deemed a viable alternative. In this regard, as an exploratory study we conducted an online questionnaire survey that was completed by 654 companion dog owners aged between 19 and 39 years residing in Seoul, South Korea. The questions pertained to the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the owners, their attitudes toward their companion dogs, and their opinions on the provision of unprescribed owner-administered injections. A 5-point Likert scale was used to assess their opinions about unprescribed injections, with responses categorized as negative (disagree, strongly disagree) and non-negative (neutral, agree, strongly agree). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to assess the association of explanatory variables with whether the owners held negative opinions regarding unprescribed owner-administered injections. The results revealed that owners with more favorable attitudes toward their dogs tended to have negative opinions about unprescribed owner-administered injections (odds ratio = 3.50, 95%; confidence interval = 2.42–5.11), but no significant effect of household income. Although further research is required to confirm the causal relationships, improvement of owners’ attitudes toward their companion dogs may be important for addressing the problem of unprescribed injections. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent years, much has been written about the growth of anti-immigrant sentiment in Western countries. Propagated by the fastest growing party family, far right-wing parties, there is growing support in Western populations in favour of scapegoating Muslim immigrants for economic, cultural and security problems. However, less has been written on how Muslim immigrants feel about their host country. What is their sense of belonging and identification with their country of residence? In this review article, we summarise the results of 29 studies that explicitly focus on questions of integration, national identity and sense of belonging of Muslim immigrants. The studies we review document a range of outcomes, varying from a low sense of belonging and attachment to the country of residence to extremely high integration levels and loyalty. It seems that most variation depends on the country of residence at the macro-level and on their education at the individual level. © 2021 Association for the Study of Ethnicity and Nationalism and John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - There remains an obvious gap in the acculturation literature, which relates to cultural change associated with the majority/dominant group. This paper explores how majority members react to a perceived expectation from minority members that majority members should undergo cultural change. A study was conducted exploring how majority members' perceptions of a demand by minority members that the majority should adopt the minority culture affects the majority members' preferences for minority acculturation, and whether effects are mediated by perceptions of symbolic threat. Two hundred sixty-six participants who self-reported being white British completed an online survey. A model was hypothesized whereby a perception that minority members demand that the majority takes on the minority culture predicted perceived symbolic threat, which was in turn negatively associated with a desire that minority members should maintain the minority culture, and positively with a desire that minority members should adopt the majority culture. Results supported the hypothesized model, with all individual paths and indirect effects significant in the hypothesized directions. Symbolic threat mediated the effect of perceived demand for minority culture adoption on majority preferences for minority acculturation. Findings are discussed in relation to implications for intergroup relations in culturally plural societies. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Physical activity is important for children's health and wellbeing, yet participation declines across teenage years. It is important to understand the mechanisms that could support adolescents to maintain physical activity participation. The aim of this study was firstly to examine change in sports and nonsports activities over two years during adolescence. Secondly, we explored possible predictors of physical activity and sports participation after two years. Method. A longitudinal cohort study was conducted between 2011 and 2013. Our data were collected from 1225 Norwegian adolescents who were followed over a two-year period, from 6th to 8th grade (11 to 13 years) and from 8th to 10th grade (13 to 15 years). We examined the relations between physical activity and predictors such as peer support, parent support, socioeconomic status (SES), attitude towards physical education, active transportation to school, self-rated health, body image, and change of nonsports activities. We used linear regression analyses and binary logistic regression to explore possible predictors of physical activity and sports participation after two years. Results. We found a significant reduction in sports participation during early adolescence, most pronounced, from 8th to 10th grade (from 13 to 15 years). Factors which predicted physical activity after two years were a positive attitude towards physical education, perceived support from parents, if the student travelled to school in an active way (by walk or bicycle) and also how the student rated his/her own health. The last three factors also predicted improvements of physical activity during the two years. Possible predictors of persisting or starting doing sports were increasing levels of self-rated health, increasing socioeconomic status, whereas increasing engagement in nonsports activities predicted reduced participation in sports. Conclusion. Health promotive efforts aiming at increasing active school transportation, parental support, and subjective health seem important for maintenance of physical activity and sports participation during adolescence. Attitudes may improve by adapting physical education to individual needs and interests and can function as an additional promotive factor. © 2021 Amalie Rullestad et al.

AB  - Perceived discrimination, intergroup contact and acceptance are often encountered during acculturation processes. Based on large-scale survey data collected in the Netherlands among Antillean-Dutch, Moroccan-Dutch, Surinamese-Dutch, and Turkish-Dutch immigrant groups, relations were tested between acculturation antecedents (perceived discrimination, intergroup contact, and perceived acceptance), mediating conditions (cultural maintenance and cultural adoption), and acculturation outcomes (psychological and sociocultural outcomes). Confirmatory factor analyses pointed to adequate psychometric qualities for all concepts in the total group and to invariance in the four Dutch immigrant groups. Structural equation modeling revealed a very good fit for our model in the total group and the four immigrant groups. The acculturation model captured similar experiences, notwithstanding the different cultural backgrounds of the four groups. Experiencing discrimination had a direct negative effect on sociocultural and psychological outcomes such as well-being, and indirectly via cultural adoption. The frequency of immigrants’ contacts with various groups positively affected adopting the new culture and maintaining their own. This implies both attitudes are needed, that is, appreciating their background culture while also having a positive attitude toward Dutch society and more confidence in sociocultural skills. Surinamese-Dutch appeared to best fit the described acculturation process. However, there were also some differential effects. For example, for the Turkish-Dutch group, experiencing more discrimination did not result in a more negative attitude toward Dutch society. In addition, for Antillean-Dutch the frequency of contact with various cultures had no direct effect on mediating conditions. Further research should uncover general acculturation mechanisms without neglecting singular patterns within the various immigrant groups. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Public debates proclaim that Muslims have turned their backs on Western societies and their “core values”. Quantitative studies have shown that Muslim migrants identify more with their origin nation and less with their host country, and that they support gender equality less than other migrants. While often attributed to Muslims’ religiosity, migrants’ denominations also reflect whether they belonged to the dominant religious majority or a marginalized minority in their origin country, which also shapes national identifications and support for gender equality. EURISLAM data on 1,500 migrants from Turkey and Pakistan show that Alevi and Ahmadiyya minority-migrants identify less with their origin country and more with their host society than Sunni majority-migrants. Pivotally, marginalized minority-migrants acculturate faster, as their support for gender equality increases more strongly over the years than majority-migrants’. Altogether, focusing on essentialist views of Muslims’ religion overlooks other mechanisms that shape diversity in acculturation among Muslim migrants. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - In 2016, then-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick triggered ongoing political controversies by kneeling during the United States National Anthem to protest police brutality against African Americans. Conventional wisdom holds that the public reaction to Kaepernick’s actions was driven by racial and ethnic demographics. In this research note, we suggest two social-psychological traits are key to understanding individuals’ attitudes on the Kaepernick protests: racial resentment and authoritarian personality. Using an original survey fielded in fall 2018, we show that both racial resentment and authoritarian personality were strong predictors of attitudes toward the Kaepernick protests. Furthermore, using a survey experiment, we show that the impact of each trait on attitudes toward the protests is similar regardless of whether racial and authoritarian cues were included in the question wording. The results highlight the consequences of the continuing roles of racial resentment and authoritarian personality in structuring public opinion in the United States. © 2021 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - This paper argues that, on the development of European Union (EU)/Eurozone fiscal capacity German governments have consistently engaged in foot-dragging. Few German state elites have ever supported European fiscal capacity building beyond the EC budget. Following the outbreak of the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis, German governments agreed to the creation of financial support mechanisms only with reluctance. We see a case of continuity in German policy preferences driven by consistent ordoliberal and, specifically, moral hazard concerns. The important long-term change that we can observe relates to the growing importance for successive governments of avoiding audience costs driven by sceptical public opinion and the rise of a challenger party in German politics. German government support for a massive EU fiscal response to the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates an exceptional policy position in favour of temporary financial mechanisms involving no fiscal transfers among member state governments. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of governmental management of the pandemic on the morbidity and mortality of migrants, gendered and racialized groups by focussing on the relation of its public health message campaign to accommodation, health and survival. The Hostile Environment immigration policies have restricted the ability of these groups to adhere to Government’s public health guidelines, increasing risks of their contracting coronavirus. These policies exacerbate existing health inequalities in intersectional ways. The Covid virus, in its socially reproductive capacity, can thus be understood as a biological descriptor for a political crisis of intersectional inequality in the politics of health. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Minority groups striving for integration may support representation in state institutions as well as recognition measures not as ends in themselves but only insofar as they believe that these reforms can advance their full integration into mainstream society. We illustrate this argument by focusing on perceptions about police reforms among Israeli Jews of Ethiopian descent, a racial minority. Drawing on data from public opinion surveys, focus groups, and interviews with community activists, our analysis indicates that Ethiopian Israelis support recruitment of co-ethnic officers (representation) and cultural sensitivity training of police officers (recognition) because they believe it could change police’s attitudes and behaviors. However, they are also conscious of the downsides of these reforms as they might perpetuate their stigmatization as a distinct group that requires special accommodation. This paper suggests that successful integration strategies need to take into account how minority groups view their status within the state’s citizenship regime. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Drawing from recent theories of economic accountability that stress the contextual nature of attributed responsibility, this paper explores how variation in regional authority influences the interplay between objective regional economic conditions and perceived regional economic performance. The study uses a virtually unexplored set of surveys about public opinion in European Union regions in a broad sample of politically decentralized European democracies. The results demonstrate that while higher levels of self-rule increase the weight citizens place on economic outcomes when building their regional evaluations, higher levels of shared rule reduce it. © 2021 Regional Studies Association.

AB  - Personal values become increasingly relevant for immigrant-related bias in the European context. Situated in group conflict theories, human values theory and social identity theory encourage different interpretations of how our interest in the welfare of those closest to us, i.e. the in-group (benevolence), and the prosperity of all beings (universalism) inform attitudes towards immigrants. The present study examines how these self-transcending human values affect perceptions of immigrant threat. Using nationally pooled data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for fifteen European countries, the results show that benevolence and universalism tend to affect perceived immigrant threat in opposite directions. A part of individuals’ anti-immigrant bias does not stem from strictly self-interested motivations, as often proposed, but by a sense of loyalty to the interests of our immediate contacts. The group we place our loyalty matters. So does the national context suggesting that grand scheme interpretations can fall short. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigates how news stories about models' social identities, models' actual social identities, and ease of categorization of models into societally predominant gender and racial categories affect processing and evaluation of persuasive messages. Participants read news stories about fashion companies that used transgender or biracial models in advertising campaigns or control stories and then viewed a series of still images edited to look like advertisements. Physiological responding and self-reported attitudes were recorded. Results indicated more positive evaluation of images preceded by news stories about models' social identities compared to control stories. With a few exceptions, participants did not differ in their evaluation of images based on actual identity, although actual identity did affect processing. While participants responded positively to images with racially ambiguous models, they did not respond positively to images with androgynous models. Results are discussed in regard to theoretical and practical implications. © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Communication Association.

AB  - We conducted person-centered analysis of sexual orientation beliefs among sexual minorities to explore potential relationships between these beliefs and sexual orientation, developmental milestones, race and ethnicity, and attitudes about sexual orientation. We recruited participants (N = 416) via Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed measures of beliefs about sexual orientation and attitudes about their own sexuality, as well as assessments of mental health and age of sexual identity development milestones. We conducted a latent profile analysis and found three distinct sexual orientation belief profiles, similar to those previously observed in predominantly straight samples. We found that sexual orientation and race-ethnicity predicted belief profile membership, with the latter exhibiting the most substantial effect. Of the four identity developmental milestones tested, only the age of first same-sex attraction predicted belief profile membership. Across profiles, members differed significantly in their mean endorsement of both positive and negative attitudes regarding sexual orientation and psychological distress. Thus, the current research suggests that sexual orientation beliefs are powerful constructs in the lives of sexual minorities, with relationships to sexual orientation, other social identities, and mental health. © 2021 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - This article studies the asymmetric effects of credit and blame attributions in economic news on government evaluations. We rely on a dataset combining a manual content analysis of Dutch economic news (print, television, online; N = 5,630) with a three-wave panel survey (N = 3,240) that was fielded in 2015. Results show that people who are exposed to news in which the government is blamed for the economy tend to adopt this frame by assigning responsibility to the government for the economic crisis. In addition, exposure to blame attributions leads to more negative government evaluations. This effect is partly mediated through the attribution of crisis responsibility. Credit attributions in the news do not have any effect on public opinion. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In this study, I test a model of competing theoretical explanations of Asian American attitudes toward immigration by studying the effects of acculturation, group consciousness and political commonality with other groups, and contextual factors. Using the 2018 Civic Engagement and Political Participation of Asian American Survey, Asian Americans’ policy preferences on Syrian refugees, Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Muslim travel ban, and a border wall are examined. Multinomial logistic regression analyses reveal that acculturation explains positive attitudes toward immigration among Asian Americans whereas factors such as Asian identity, political commonality with other racial groups, and the perceived racial mix of neighborhoods have limited and mixed influence on Asian American immigration attitudes. As one of very few studies on immigrants’ attitudes toward immigration policies, this study contributes to our better understanding of how the fastest-growing immigrant group like Asian Americans determine their attitudes toward policies that target immigrants. © 2021, Florida Gulf Coast University.

AB  - In the present work, we review a growing programme of research identifying deficits in race-based interpersonal sensitivity, specifically emotion detection, as a route to creating pitfalls in interracial interactions and generating race-based disparities. Most existing research examining race disparities takes a bias perspective–focusing on how stereotypes and prejudice can make judgements more positive or negative as a mechanism underlying race-based inequality. We review this literature, while also providing evidence that differential sensitivity–more accurately reading cues and signals of ingroup and majority group members than outgroup and minority group members–can also serve as a mechanism underlying race-based discrimination. We propose that an integrated perspective encompassing sensitivity and response bias as routes to intergroup inequality may offer researchers a novel approach to existing intergroup questions as well as a generative perspective on intergroup research programmes. © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the correlates of foreign policy attitudes in Moldova by a multilevel analysis, and to also reveal some characteristics of the Moldova's difficult geopolitical and economic context, such as the ethnical conflicts and poverty. A set of four foreign policy attitudes are explained upon individual- and regional level socio-economic and demographic correlates, of which poverty is the main focus, being represented here by several objective, subjective, uni- and multidimensional indicators. An indicator of deprivation is derived from a group of poverty indicators by the method Item Response Theory. Deprivation, subjective poverty, ethnicity and the Russian media influence are found to be associated with negative attitudes toward all foreign policies, while satisfaction with economic conditions in the country and a positive attitude toward refugees are both associated with positive attitudes toward all foreign policies.

AB  - Research addressing the linkages between acculturation and markers of adolescent well-being across multiple ethnic minority groups is limited in scope and breadth, even though children of immigrant origin are the fastest growing population. We examined cross-sectional relationships between acculturation and substance use, socioemotional well-being, and academic achievement. Somali, Latino, and Hmong adolescents in Minnesota provided data as part of the EAT 2010 (Eating and Activity in Teens) cohort study (N = 1,066). Acculturation was based on nativity, language usually spoken at home, and length of residence in the United States. Chi-square, ANOVA, and regression models were used to test for differences in adolescent well-being by acculturation and ethnic group, and interaction terms were added to models to test effect modification by ethnicity. Hmong adolescents had the highest mean acculturation scores (4.4 ± 1.5), whereas Somali adolescents (2.2 ± 1.8) were the least acculturated. Independent of ethnicity, acculturation was positively associated with marijuana (OR: 1.38; CI [1.25, 1.53]) and alcohol use (OR: 1.12; CI [1.02, 1.22]), and was negatively associated with academic achievement, based on grade point average (β = −0.07; CI [−0.12, −0.03]). Interaction effects indicated significant differences by ethnicity only for academic achievement; significant associations between acculturation and academic achievement were evident only for Somali and Latino youth. Prevention programming should include supports for multilingual and multicultural learners and account for cultural assets within immigrant origin families that maintain and nurture protective factors as adolescents acculturate and transition into young adulthood.

AB  - This paper aims to analyze the external and internal drivers of young consumers’ intention to participate in the sharing economy in tourism. From previous findings, a causal model (PLS) is designed to generate an integrated, practical, and novel structural model that significantly predicts the intention to participate. The model, consisting of nine dimensions, includes consumers’ external and internal variables. Separately, these variables have all been considered relevant in the literature, though they have not been studied jointly before. The descriptive results show the excellent attitude and predisposition of young people toward the tourism sharing economy, which facilitates their participation. Through the model, the importance of all internal and external consumer variables in the formation of intention are proven; however, attitude and social norm are most notable among them. Trust is also a critical variable that serves as the link between internal and external variables. The study provides managers of sharing economy platforms with knowledge to encourage young consumers’ participation in a communication and market orientation context. The generational approach (Generation Z) used also allows the conclusions and implications to be transferred to other regions and sectors. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper aims to examine the correlates of foreign policy attitudes in Moldova by a multilevel analysis, and to also reveal some characteristics of the Moldova’s difficult geopolitical and economic context, such as the ethnical conflicts and poverty. A set of four foreign policy attitudes are explained upon individual- and regional level socio-economic and demographic correlates, of which poverty is the main focus, being represented here by several objective, subjective, uni- and multidimensional indicators. An indicator of deprivation is derived from a group of poverty indicators by the method Item Response Theory. Deprivation, subjective poverty, ethnicity and the Russian media influence are found to be associated with negative attitudes toward all foreign policies, while satisfaction with economic conditions in the country and a positive attitude toward refugees are both associated with positive attitudes toward all foreign policies. © 2021 Monica Răileanu Szeles.

AB  - Infectious disease poses a threat to reproductive fitness. However, the costs associated with infectious disease are often greater for females than males. Sexist attitudes toward females may have in part emerged from disease-avoidance concerns, in order to decrease infectious disease threat and promote reproductive success for females (and males indirectly). Across three studies, disease-avoidance tendencies were positively correlated with benevolent sexism (perceiving females as pure and in need of protection). Hostile sexism, or more traditional negative attitudes toward females, was inconsistently related to disease avoidance. Furthermore, right-wing authoritarianism partially accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and benevolent sexism, whereas right-wing authoritarianism fully accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and hostile sexism. By encouraging traditional sex roles and restricting female sexual behavior, benevolent sexism may reduce infectious disease threat in females, while maintaining positive relations between the sexes (unlike hostile sexism), which is important for reproduction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Evaluating medical students' attitudes toward sexual and gender minority (SGM) people is important to identify negative attitudes early in education and to design curriculum to mitigate biases. The purpose of this study was to investigate medical students' attitudes toward SGM people as a whole as well as specific populations within the SGM community. We sought to determine whether attitudes toward SGM people differed between students' demographics and training. Methods: We conducted an online survey-based study among 1007 medical students at 12 U.S. medical schools. Participants completed the Attitudes Toward LGBT People Scale and were randomized to complete another scale specific to one group within the SGM community. We evaluated the association between student demographics and medical training and attitudes toward SGM people overall and toward specific SGM populations. This study was conducted between January and June 2020. Results: Overall, we found that medical students had positive attitudes toward SGM people and specific SGM groups. The most important factor affecting medical students' attitudes on all scales was religiosity, as very religious students held less positive attitudes toward SGM people. In addition, cisgender female students held more positive attitudes toward SGM people overall and toward specific SGM populations. Conclusion: Medical education must ensure that future physicians receive comprehensive and culturally competent training to prepare them to care for SGM patients. Based on our findings, this training should include specific content to help medical students identify potential biases toward SGM people, as well as strategies to acknowledge and confront these biases. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - In classical conformity experiments, the conformity has been defined as a negative phenomenon or as a distortion of judgment under the group pressure. Furthermore, experiments are mainly performed within social aggregates rather than on groups, and even less on cohesive ones. This study aims to reshape positively the conformity while happening within cohesive groups. It shows how the positive social pressure of cohesive group members, intended as an influence based on optimism, can cause to the less optimistic group member a positive conformity. The present research relies on a quasi-experimental design in a cross-cultural setting. It considers the positive influence within groups of family members belonging to family businesses that are cohesive in terms of values. Both 'positive conformity' as a concept and 'positive conformity experiment' as a procedure are originated in this study. Findings show that out of 129 naïve, 54 conformed totally, 46 partially, and 29 resisted. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - We review a 40-year corpus of research that we collectively name “Multiple Categorisation Theory” (MCT). From early illustrations using the minimal group paradigm, through a focus on how people cognitively represent social diversity, to recent models of outgroup “re-humanisation”, this work has revealed much about how we think about inclusivity, exclusion, and intergroup differences. We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical and practical implications of this research programme. © 2020 European Association of Social Psychology.

AB  - Objectives: There is important variation in beliefs about immigration within the publics of immigrant-receiving societies but empirical social research has largely overlooked it. The “imagined immigration” concept aims to bring these beliefs back in as an important component of public attitudes toward immigrants. It also offers a new perspective on the political conflict around immigration that persists despite the consensus on desired qualities of potential immigrants among citizens in industrial democracies. Methods: I review the imagined immigration concept and present new empirical evidence in its favor using original survey studies in the United States and Britain. Results: I describe respondents’ beliefs about immigrants, demonstrate their association with partisanship, and confirm that these beliefs are significantly related to perceptions of immigration as harmful—even when controlled for partisanship, ideology, and ethnocentrism. Conclusion: I corroborate the foundations of the imagined immigration concept and discuss its promise and limitations. © 2020 by the Southwestern Social Science Association

AB  - While a large body of research has highlighted the conflict-inducing effects of climate change, we still know very little about the mechanisms linking environmental conditions to violent conflict. This article investigates the plausibility of a prominent channel according to which scarcity of natural resources can foster violent conflict through deteriorating intergroup relations. In addition to assessing the direct effects of adverse environmental conditions on intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic trust, we suggest a conditional argument on the role of horizontal inequality of hazard exposure. Environmental hazards are ‘unequal’ if they systematically affect ethnic groups differently. While inequality may reinforce intra-ethnic ties and out-group suspicion, equal hazard exposure may create a sense of unity among diverse victims in their collective struggle to cope with harsh environmental conditions. We test these arguments in the context of the severe drought periods that affected most East African countries in the years 2004 and 2005. The empirical analysis combines gridded information on drought severity with geo-located survey data across six countries in the region (Afrobarometer survey 2005/2006). Our main analyses find that exposure to drought hazards correlates positively with self-reported trust within and across ethnic groups. The latter association, however, depends on the degree of intergroup equality of hazard exposure and wanes as inequality increases. Taken together, these findings indicate that if droughts increase the risk of violent conflict, they seem to do so through mechanisms other than intergroup polarization and despite their positive association with ethnic trust. This is most likely the case in contexts where there is pronounced horizontal inequality of drought hazards. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background and Objectives: This research aimed at investigating the psychological impact of national quarantine in Italy, and the psychosocial factors that are may influence this impact. Methods: A convenience sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study. Conclusion: The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Russia declared itself the protector of Russian-speakers living in former Soviet Republics in the early 1990s and utilized a variety of hard and soft power mechanisms to influence ethnopolitics in those states. After the Baltic States gained membership in both NATO and the EU in 2004, Russia began to place more emphasis on “softer” mechanisms of influence and to rely less on military and economic levers. These “softer” mechanisms include cultivating ties with Russian-speakers through compatriot organizations, supporting cultural and educational initiatives, and using the Russian media to influence public opinion. Through an analysis of recent parliamentary debates over education and naturalization policies, this article demonstrates how Russia’s soft power agenda provides a key context in which Latvia’s policies toward Russian-speakers are made. Policymakers use Russian “soft power” frames to shape policies in more exclusionary and inclusionary directions. Consequently, while Russia may possess significant soft power resources, its influence on policymaking in target states depends to a large extent on how policymakers frame Russia’s agenda within domestic policy debates. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Inconsistent information on levels of eating pathology in Asian Americans exist. We investigated whether there were differences in mean scores for eating disorder (ED) symptoms among Whites, Asian Americans, and individuals identifying as another race (i.e., non-Asian people of color [NAPOC]). Participants included 716 college students (M age = 19.23; SD = 1.65) from a southeastern university. ED symptoms were assessed with the Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI). Internalizing symptoms were evaluated via the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). One-way ANOVAs investigated mean differences in symptoms between racial groups, with and without adjusting for sex, BMI, and internalizing symptoms. Overall, 16% (n = 114) of the sample identified as Asian American, 67% (n = 477) as White, and 17% (n = 125) as NAPOC. After correcting for multiple testing and adjusting for covariates, Asian Americans reported higher mean scores of purging, muscle building, and cognitive restraint (qs < 0.05) than Whites and NAPOC. Asian Americans also scored higher on restriction compared with Whites (qs < 0.05), as well as body dissatisfaction and negative attitudes toward obesity compared with NAPOC (qs < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the existence of racial differences among specific ED symptoms, highlighting the importance of considering these distinctions when diagnosing and treating EDs among diverse communities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study explores the differences in system support between the ethnic majority and ethnic minority populations in Turkey and Israel, taking into account three specific dimensions of system support: national identity, evaluation of democracy, and institutional trust. A comparison of the gaps in these dimensions is conducted using surveys. The findings show that, in both countries, the majority tends to show higher levels of system support than the minority. Among the Turkish Kurdish minority, lower levels of system support can be found across all the dimensions examined, while among the Palestinian citizens of Israel minority, the gaps are bigger in the cultural aspect of national identity but much smaller in the evaluation of democracy and institutional trust. These findings are discussed in light of both the differences between the two regimes and their dissimilar strategies for addressing ethno-national divisions and the theoretical implications of examining the multidimensionality of system support. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has led to widespread worries that the health crisis is resulting in generalized hostility towards minorities and reduced support for a diverse society. Relying on a large survey of diversity attitudes in Germany fielded before and during the pandemic, we employ a quasi-experimental design to evaluate whether such a trend has occurred among the general public. Past work suggests two competing expectations–one anticipating a rise in hostility grounded in threat theories, and one anticipating stability grounded in public opinion research and theories of longer-term value change. Empirical results reveal generally high assent to socio-demographic diversity and minority accommodation, and remarkable stability during the pandemic period. Additionally, survey vignettes show strong and equally stable anti-discrimination norms that are inclusive of Asian-origin populations. Overall, results suggest that surges in racist incidents during the pandemic do not reflect analogous surges in hostility within the population at large. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - To gain insights into social integration of second- and third-generation immigrant youth in Dutch secondary schools, we examined the two sides: immigrant youth's attitudes toward the societal majority and the societal majority youth's attitudes toward immigrants, while taking into account immigrant youth's diverse cultural backgrounds. The sample included Dutch-born Turkish (n = 187), Moroccan (n = 188), and Surinamese (n = 164) adolescents as well as societal majority youth (n = 2,141) across 169 classrooms in 92 Dutch secondary schools. School-based exposure to, and friendships with relevant out-group classmates were examined separately as predictors of out-group attitudes. Also, the mediational function of out-group friendships, i.e., immigrant respectively societal majority, on the association between exposure and attitudes was tested. The results varied between immigrant and societal majority youth, as well as across the cultural groups. Overall, out-group exposure was found to benefit all immigrant adolescents’ attitudes toward the societal majority. For societal majority adolescents, however, the association between exposure, friendships and attitudes differed based on the relevant out-group. This study highlights the nuances between immigrant groups and between immigrant and societal majority groups’ attitudes toward one another. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Recent outbreaks of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) in Waziristan make the disease a public health concern in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, Pakistan. The awareness and behavior of local community towards the disease is an important factor towards effective control and management of CL in endemic areas of Pakistan. A cross-sectional community based survey was piloted in new emerging district of North Waziristan Agency (KPK province), Pakistan from August 2019- February 2020. The study aimed to examine the Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) of the local community members regarding CL. The results revealed that majority of the participants were male. Only 48.2% participants have knowledge about CL and the respondents had a moderate knowledge of CL vector and the disease. Few of the respondents were aware that CL is caused by sand flies, their breeding place, biting time, transmission of CL and control measures. Skin infection and sand-flies were the main disease symptoms and disease vector were known to some of the respondents. Most of the respondents showed positive attitude towards disease seriousness and believed that the disease could be cured and can be treated through modern medicines. Admission to hospitals, cleanliness and use of bed nets were the treatment measures for the disease in suspected patients, whereas some believed that the use of bed nets could be helpful in preventing the leishmaniasis. Moderate knowledge of the CL and its transmission in the study area emphasize the need to initiate health education and awareness campaigns to reduce the disease risk and burden in this highly endemic area in near future. © 2020

AB  - A robust stream of research has shown the detrimental influence of slurs and derogatory epithets on attitudes toward minority groups. Extending prior work, we explored the influence of positive labels ascribed to the majority group on the evaluation of the minority group. Specifically, three studies tested the possibility that the label “straight,” generally linked with the concept of morality, would promote a negative evaluation of gay men. Study 1 exposed English speakers to an individual person described as straight (vs. heterosexual) while Study 2 exposed English speakers to a target person described as straight (vs. heterosexual vs. no label). Study 3 considered a non-English sample (i.e., Italian adults) and experimentally induced the association between the straight label and the concept of heterosexuality. In each study, participants were asked to express their attitudes toward a gay target after the manipulation. Results showed that heterosexual participants exposed to the label “straight” reported more negative attitudes toward gay men than heterosexual participants exposed to the label “heterosexual” (or when they were not exposed to any label). Critically, such an effect emerged only among highly religious participants. Implications for policies and prejudice reduction are discussed. © 2020 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - This article asks what shapes public support for comprehensive peace agreements that aim to end violent conflict in deeply divided societies. Although public perceptions are critical for the success of territorial settlements, little scholarly attention has focused on citizen attitudes towards peace in the post-implementation phase. We develop and empirically test a theory of citizen support for peace agreements that relates power-sharing institutions to broader citizens’ security considerations and integrates into this theory the roles of international peacekeeping, ascriptive minority/majority identities and exposure to alternative governance structures (i.e. federal, consociational and centripetalist). We argue that the degree to which a peace treaty provides credible security to citizens determines public support for power-sharing. We test this argument in a least likely case Bosnia Herzegovina. Using data from a 2013 representative survey with 1007 respondents, we examine the determinants of popular support for the Dayton Peace Accords. Our findings suggest that in each of the three main ethnic groups of Bosnia, more people would have voted for Dayton than against it and highlight the mechanisms through which individual and ethnic group security concerns shape support for the country’s post-conflict institutions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The African Union wants to make ‘being African' an important immigration admission criterion amongst its member states. This would be a large-scale change to border control in South Africa, altering the nation’s symbolic boundaries. But what do ordinary South Africans think about this change? And what are the determinants of public support for drawing boundaries in this way? Using data from the South African Social Attitudes Survey, this paper argues that social identity is one of the primary drivers of how people think about this issue. This outcome showcases the way identity politics drives South African attitudes towards border control. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - What are the dynamics of partisan conflict in the mass public in the United States? Has this conflict been driven by Republicans moving to the right across a wide range of issues, or have Democrats contributed to this as well? Have these changes been symmetric, occurring for both sides, or asymmetric, occurring for just one side? Understanding how the partisan gaps have widened may shed light on potential prospects for reversing extreme political conflict in public opinion. This paper examines this question with an analysis of opinion trend data over the last 40 years. It includes an original analysis of these trends among racial and ethnic groups. We find that symmetric partisan changes have only occurred among whites. Overall partisan differences have been less for Blacks and Hispanics than for whites. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study investigates the influence of moral ingroup versus outgroup behavior on 5- and 6-year-olds’ and 8- and 9-year-olds’ own moral behavior (N = 296). After minimal group assignment, children in Experiment 1 observed adult ingroup or outgroup members engaging in prosocial sharing or antisocial stealing before they themselves had the opportunity to privately donate stickers or take away stickers from others. Older children shared more than younger children, and prosocial models elicited higher sharing. Surprisingly, group membership had no effect. Experiment 2 investigated the same question using peer models. Children in the younger age group were significantly influenced by ingroup behavior, whereas older children were not affected by group membership. Additional measures reveal interesting insights into how moral ingroup and outgroup behavior affects intergroup attitudes, evaluations, and choices. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world, with Muslims being the majority in 50 countries. The substantial numbers of Muslim immigrants moving to the West and the fact that Muslim values are quite different from the secular system adopted by Europeans and Americans are more reasons why it is imperative to understand their attitudes toward Westerners. The present study examined and analyzed the relationship between two types of Muslim religiosity and prejudice toward the West in an Arab-Muslim context, a region that is dominated by Muslim believers. Further, the study also examined other associated constructs to prejudice on anti-Western attitudes. Religious Fundamentalism (RF) and the intrinsic component of the Intrinsic/Extrinsic (I/E-R) scale were both used to measure Muslim religiosity in an Arab-Muslim sample of 608 participants that were collected from 17 Arab countries. Also, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Dogmatism (DOG) were included to test their mediated effects on the relationship between Islamic religiosity and anti-Western attitudes. The results indicated that Islamic fundamentalism was the dominant predictor of unfavorable attitudes toward the West, followed by intrinsic Muslim religiosity and dogmatism. The findings also showed that RWA and DOG partially mediated the relationship between intrinsic Muslim religiosity and anti-Western attitudes. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings in an Islamic context. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Disgust has a social component in which others are perceived as more disgusting than the self. Key characteristics of this social component were examined in six experiments. Experiment 1 established the social disgust Implicit Association Test (SD-IAT) applicability for assessing social disgust. Results revealed a congruency effect, in which participants implicitly associated other-race strangers with disgusting stimuli. Experiment 2 explored whether the SD-IAT effect is the result of familiarity. Unfamiliar in-group and out-group members were presented in the IAT. Results were identical to those of Experiment 1. Experiments 3 (using intergroup stimuli) and 4 (using interpersonal stimuli) investigated whether the SD-IAT congruency effect stems from disgust directed at others or from self-liking. Results showed a larger congruency effect for social disgust than for self-liking. Experiments 5 and 6 investigated whether SD stems from an association between the non-self and either disgust or negative valence. Findings showed a larger SD-IAT congruency effect for disgust. The combined results delineate the core aspects of SD and show that it is a heterogeneous phenomenon, based on relative social categories, in which the non-self is perceived as disgusting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Normative debates and comparative studies on voting rights regulations are lively. However, little is known on what citizens think of enfranchising migrants. This paper starts to fill this gap. We conducted an original survey in 26 European countries (n = 16,555). In most countries, an (often narrow) majority of sedentary nationals supports enfranchising emigrants. In all countries, no majority favours the enfranchisement of immigrants, although falling short of a majority in several cases. Being a woman, a bi-national citizen, but also younger, and leaning to the political left is associated with higher support for enfranchising immigrants. However, no individual-level characteristics, apart from age, is associated with the support for enfranchising emigrants. An exclusive national identity is associated not only with lower support for enfranchising immigrants but for emigrants, as well. Furthermore, larger relative sizes of immigrant population fuel support for enfranchisement of this group–up to a certain level. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: Consequences of colorism are well documented, yet little is known about its relationship with political views of racial/ethnic minorities. Although a very small literature found no evidence that skin tone shapes political attitudes of Latinx Americans, the present study was the first to extend this to immigration and language policy preferences. Because support for public policies is an important mechanism through which inequality is either reduced or reproduced, this filled an important gap in the literature on colorism and political behavior. Method: Using binary or ordered logistic regression, skin tone, perceived discrimination, and demographic characteristics were examined as predictors of Latinxs’ policy preferences for U.S. border security and/or mandated use of English. Several probability samples were analyzed: one national sample (N = 430), as well as other national (N = 349, mean age 41), regional (N = 256, mean ages 36–40), and nationally representative samples (N = 8,065, mean ages 32–35). Results: Relative to their counterparts, the lightest-skinned Latinx women were more tolerant of restrictive policies—tighter border security and a preference for English as the only official language. Among Latinx men, medium-skinned subgroups reported the most unfavorable opinions about a U.S. border wall policy whereas lighter-skinned men were less opposed to this policy. Conclusions: Findings suggested that skin tone biases may be tied to men’s engagement on border security issues and women’s support for language and border policies. Therefore, colorism may be implicated in important processes that shape American politics and Latinx public opinion. © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - Clitorectomies performed on the genitals of infants identified as female and as intersex have been described both as similar procedures and as different procedures. The former types of surgery have been recognised more consistently as human rights abuses than the latter in recent decades. We tested social psychological explanations of why human rights are differently recognised when infants are described as ‘intersex’ or ‘female’; 122 laypeople in the UK read one of two near-identical descriptions of clitorectomies performed on intersex or female infants and reported their agreement with 22 items about the human rights of such infants. Clitorectomies were perceived as violating human rights more by women than by men, and more so when infants were described as female than intersex. Endorsement of human rights was better predicted by several psychological variables when infants were described as female than as intersex. Less politically conservative participants, as assessed by a Right-Wing Authoritarianism measure, and participants who trusted medical authority more recognised human rights violations of female infants more than intersex infants. Results are discussed with respect to human rights efforts to protect infants from medically non-necessary genital surgery on the basis of membership in identity categories or possession of sex characteristics. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The outcome of the 2016 presidential election in the United States was partly influenced by factors such as social marginalization and anti-immigrant sentiment, both of which have been associated with the global rise in far-right voting (FRV) outcomes. Sociological hypotheses such as group threat and group contact have been suggested as potential contextual factors in the relationship between immigrant share and far-right support; more recently, the halo effect has been used as a spatial mechanism to explore these relationships. Briefly, the halo effect describes increased FRV in ethnically homogeneous areas that are near ethnically diverse areas. This portentous trend has significant international implications, but differences in the spatial distribution and composition of immigrant share and the spatial scale of analysis have produced inconsistent empirical results. This study addressed the spatial distribution of the halo effect in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and used geographically weighted regression to explore spatial nonstationarity in the relationships between socioeconomic factors and Republican (GOP) support. Spatial nonstationarity is observed when a relationship is not globally consistent such as in large or complex areas where local processes might interact with or overwhelm global processes. We found evidence of spatial nonstationarity in the relationships between GOP support and many socioeconomic factors, including the halo effect. In addition to providing a better understanding of the spatial context of electoral dynamics and their interactions at a local scale, these results indicate that spatial nonstationarity in these relationships might be partially responsible for inconsistent results in previous studies. © 2020 by American Association of Geographers.

AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement: An analysis of UK newspaper coverage of the 7/7 bombings in London revealed a high frequency of dehumanizing discourse about Muslims, particularly in the aftermath (compared to the 10-year anniversary). Further, results varied based on political orientation of the source, such that dehumanization of Muslims was associated with distrust in the right-wing news source, whereas humanization was associated with trust in the left-wing news source.

AB  - Within mainstream institutions such as colleges and universities, scientists and social leaders, alike, are faced with persistent and new challenges to forging paths toward inclusion among marginalized group members (e.g., Latino/a/x and African Americans). Integrating theoretical perspectives that conceptualize identity among marginalized groups as tied to culture and strengths with literatures on threat and stigma, we propose a “pride and prejudice” approach to inclusion. We provide support for the efficacy of inclusion as 2 pathways—one route that is associated with recognizing “pride” or the history and culture of marginalized groups and another that is related to reducing “prejudice” or perceived discrimination toward marginalized groups. Specifically, we demonstrate using actual demands for inclusion generated by students attending 80 colleges and universities that a pride and prejudice approach is consistent with collective calls for institutional change voiced by marginalized group members and their allies (Study 1). Then, Study 2, using longitudinal data of Latino/a/x and African American students (N = 1,967) attending 27 colleges and universities we reveal the impact of pride (e.g., taking an ethnic studies course) and prejudice (e.g., perceived discrimination) experiences on sense of belonging, and in turn academic and health outcomes (e.g., graduation rates, depression). We provide evidence for 1 theory-based process whereby individual experiences tied to pride and prejudice can impact belongingness through intragroup and intergroup relations. Theory and policy implications for institutional inclusion efforts including the importance of fostering ties to ingroup and outgoup members are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—Two studies support the validity and efficacy of a pride and prejudice approach to belonging. This approach is shown to have consequences for academic and health outcomes including graduation rates and depression among marginalized groups.

AB  - Cultural Appropriation Has Been Described And Discussed Within Academic And Everyday Discourse, But Little Research Has Examined Its Role In The Psychological Context Of Intergroup Relations. We Sought To Examine Whether Minority And Majority Group Members (I.E., Black And White Americans) Would Differentially Judge Instances Of Cultural Exchange As Cultural Appropriation. Five Experiments (3 Were Preregistered On Osf) Using A Variety Of Potential Cases Of Cultural Appropriation Demonstrated That Black Participants Were More Likely Than White Participants To View These Incidents As Appropriation When They Involved White Perpetrators Appropriating Black Culture (Vs. Scenarios Of Black Perpetrators Appropriating White Culture), An Effect Mediated By Distinctiveness Threat. Black (Vs. White) Participants Were Also More Likely To Perceive White Actors Who Appropriate Black Culture As Harmful And As Intentional. In Study 4, Explicit Manipulation Of Distinctiveness Threat Eliminated The Participant Race Effect: Perceivers Viewed White Perpetrators As More Appropriative Than Black Perpetrators. When Actors Were Portrayed As Using Either An Ingroup Or Outgroup Cultural Product (Study 5), Participants Perceived Use Of An Outgroup Cultural Product As More Appropriative. Studies 3–5 Were Preregistered On Osf. This Research Illuminates How Group-Based Status Interacts With And Adds To Perpetrator Prototypically To Influence Perceptions Of Cultural Appropriation, Distinguishes Perception Of Appropriation From Perception Of Racism, And Points To The Importance Of Distinctiveness Threat As A Contributor To Differential Race-Based Perceptions. Implications Of Perceiving Cultural Appropriation For Intergroup Relations Are Discussed © 2020 American Psychological Association

AB  - We examined the differences between majority and minority children (i.e., group membership) on racial categorization and perceived cultural distance, among 4- to 6-year-old children, in low diversified schools. We used a spontaneous social categorization task using pictures of children from three different racial groups broadly represented in France (Europeans, Black-, and North-Africans), and an evaluation of the perceived cultural distance between participants' in-group and the racial group represented in the picture, adapted to children and based on three factors (language, eating habits, and music). Results revealed an effect of age on racial categorization: the older the children, the more successful they are in this task. They showed a significant effect of the racial group represented in the photos on perceived cultural distance: members of minority groups (i.e., Black- and North-Africans) were evaluated as more different compared to those of the majority group on each of the factors. Finally, we got an interaction between participants' in-group and the racial group represented in the pictures, for the language factor: members of the majority group perceived as more different photographs representing minorities peers than those representing majority peers, while participants belonging to minority groups perceived no differences between photographs, according to the racial criteria. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Intersex variations render a person’s body different from both normative male and female embodiment. Medical intervention on infants’ intersex traits is long standing, common, and contested for breaching human rights to bodily integrity and self-determination. Such intervention is justified by the threat of unbearable social stigma, but empirical studies of stigma and public understanding are lacking. Here, U.K. and U.S. participants (N = 271) reported their free associations to three contested “umbrella terms” for intersex and their opinions about diverse medical and social responses. Among the umbrella terms, hermaphrodite prompted most references to nonhumans, intersex prompted most references to social identities, and disorders of sex development prompted most references to children. Participants’ opinions about medical and social responses to intersex traits were more consistently predicted by sexual identity than any other demographic variable; LGB+ participants endorsed social responses more, while heterosexual participants endorsed medical responses more. Beliefs in nonbinary gender and lower right-wing authoritarianism predicted support for social responses and opposition to medical responses and accounted for some sexual identity differences. Social and clinical implications are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—Medical intervention targeting infants’ intersex traits is a controversial way to reduce the impact of stigma on such children, but public understanding of intersex is rarely studied. Two hundred seventy-one U.S. and U.K. laypeople’s understandings of controversial “umbrella terms” in this area and opinions about medical and social interventions are described. Heterosexual people endorsed medical interventions more and social interventions less than LGB+ people in part because heterosexual people were more authoritarian and endorsed gender binary beliefs more.

AB  - How does ethnic violence affect the perpetrator group’s attitudes towards the victim group? Combining the security threat and ultimate attribution error, I expect that perpetrator group members react to security threats caused by ethnic violence to form negative attitudes towards the victim group. This study tests this hypothesis using the case of ethnic violence against refugees who came to Germany during the “migrant crisis” in 2015. Results show that a higher rate of anti-refugee violence in a German state is associated with more negative attitudes towards refugees among German natives. The effect of ethnic violence is more prominent among Germans with higher concerns for security, pinpointing the threat mechanisms. A series of additional tests, including instrumental variable strategy, Bayesian analysis, and robustness checks support the conclusion. The results of this study indicate that ethnic violence induces negative attitudes among the perpetrator group towards the victim group. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A number of important factors predicted white people vote choice in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including voters' economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, and status threat. In this paper, I establish that ethnonationalism—a set of beliefs concerning what it means to be a “true” American—was also a significant factor in the estimations of White Americans when casting their vote for president in 2016. Data from a nationally representative sample of White Americans show that ethnonationalism was a robust predictor of vote choice for Trump even after controlling for predictors known to shape vote choice, including economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, status threat, and sociodemographic indicators. These results indicate that ethnonationalism, although correlated with some of these factors, operated primarily as an independent factor that shaped White vote choice. The findings have important implications concerning the electoral activation of White majorities concerned about the perceived threat that demographic change poses to American national identity. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - This article analyses the socio-economic determinants of public preferences towards public spending and parental fees for childcare and how they are conditioned by institutional contexts. Previous studies of childcare policy preferences have focused on attitudes regarding the provision of care. However, when it comes to questions of financing, we know astonishingly little about how supportive individuals actually are of expanding pre-school early childhood education and care, and how support varies across different socio-economic groups in society. This is an important research gap because childcare provision and how it is financed have redistributive implications, which vary depending on the institutional design of childcare policy. Using novel and unique survey data on childcare preferences from eight European countries, we argue and show that preferences towards expanding childcare are more contested than it is often assumed. The institutional structure of childcare shapes how income matters for preferences towards how much should be spent and how provision should be financed. Where access to childcare is socially stratified, the poor and the rich develop different preferences towards either increasing public spending or reducing parental fees in order to improve their access to childcare. The findings in this article suggest that expanding childcare in systems characterised by unequal access can be politically contested due to diverging policy priorities of individuals from different social backgrounds. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact, that is observing an interaction between ingroup and outgroup members, can improve intergroup relations. Although vicarious contact has been operationalized in different ways, mainly via story reading or video watching, an experimental comparison of these different strategies is still missing. We conducted a school intervention with the aim of comparing the two most used forms of vicarious contact, namely story reading and video watching. Elementary schoolchildren without disabilities (N = 292) were assigned to one of three different conditions: reading a story; watching a video; control. In the two vicarious contact conditions, participants read or watched the story of a child with disability becoming friends with children without disabilities; in the control condition, participants only completed the dependent measures. Results revealed that, in general, both vicarious contact conditions were equally effective in improving outgroup attitudes and behavioural intentions. In addition, they operated with the same strength through the same underlying processes (IOS, ingroup norms). We discuss theoretical and practical implications in the context of vicarious contact as a prejudice-reduction intervention. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - It has been argued that supporting a restrictive view on the inclusion of immigrants finds its origin in a localized feeling of group identity. We test this hypothesis with a household survey in the Belgian city of Ghent (n = 3735). The results show that local and national identities are salient, but also that regional, European, and cosmopolitan identities are supported simultaneously. Especially the regional, Flemish identity is strongly associated with a restrictive, ethnic attitude toward new groups in society. A European identity was not significantly associated with this restrictive attitude. Our conclusion is that not just the geographical scale of group identity is important in explaining anti-immigrant sentiments. The specific historical connotations of every geographical level should be considered. A comparison between generations, i.e. parents and their late adolescent children, suggests that this association between specific group identities and ethnic citizenship norms is equally present among younger cohorts. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Those from low socioeconomic status (SES) often lack access to public space and, when they have access, they are often discouraged from using public space. Scholars from human geography and related fields have argued that this limits engagement in civic life and undermines sense of belonging in one's community. In the present work, we consider whether lower-SES students face this predicament in higher education, particularly at elite public institutions. Across four studies, we find that, compared with higher-SES students, lower-SES students use public space on campus less—iconic public space in particular—and this can mediate the relationship between SES and sense of belonging at the University. We also find that experimentally increasing students’ use of public space can reduce and even close SES gaps in felt belonging. Taken together, the present studies suggest that use of public space matters for belonging and for understanding gaps in belonging. This work contributes to our understanding of SES disparities in higher education. More generally, it illustrates the importance of public space.

AB  - Political campaign slogans, such as ‘Take back control of our country’ (United Kingdom Independence Party) and ‘The Netherlands ours again’ (Dutch Party for Freedom), indicate that right-wing populism appeals to the belief that the country is ‘ours’, and therefore, ‘we’ have the exclusive right to determine what happens. We examined this sense of ownership of the country (i.e. collective psychological ownership [CPO]) with the related determination right in relation to exclusionary attitudes and voting behaviour. Among Dutch (Study 1, N = 572) and British (Study 2, N = 495) participants, we found that CPO explained anti-immigrant and anti-EU attitudes, and these attitudes in turn accounted for voting ‘leave’ in the 2016 Brexit referendum in the British sample (Study 2). Additionally, CPO was more strongly related to negative immigrant attitudes among right-wing Dutch participants, whereas it was more strongly related to negative EU attitudes and voting ‘leave’ among left-wing British participants. CPO contributes to the understanding of critical contemporary social attitudes and political behaviour. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Although older adults are often seen as warm, they also may be viewed as incompetent. These perceptions of incompetence have implications for the context of immigration, whereby older immigrants may be viewed as a burden on the economy and public services and unlikely to integrate into society. The current research examined whether attitudes toward immigrant targets differ as a function of the target’s age. Studies 1 (N = 85) and 2 (N = 202) tested this question with Canadian samples and found that older immigrant targets were viewed more negatively than young adult immigrant targets, and that this was explained by the belief that older adult immigrants will have a negative impact on the economy and be a burden on public services (i.e., realistic threat). Moreover, older adult nonimmigrants were also viewed more negatively than young adult nonimmigrants, suggesting this effect may be driven by ageism. These findings demonstrate the complexity of attitudes toward immigrants and suggest that a variety of identities must be considered when studying evaluations of immigrant targets. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement: Immigration attitudes are complex, likely because of the multiple identities immigrants may hold. These studies found that one identity that is important for determining attitudes toward immigrants is age. Indeed, it was found that older adult immigrants were viewed more negatively than young adult immigrants because they were seen as less likely to contribute to the economy and more likely to be a burden on public services. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Bien que les personnes âgées puissent souvent être perçues comme étant chaleureuses, elles peuvent aussi être vues comme étant incompétentes. La perception d’incompétence a des répercussions dans le contexte de l’immigration, car les immigrants âgés peuvent être perçus comme un fardeau pour l’économie et les services publics et jugés peu susceptibles de s’intégrer dans la société. La présente recherche examine si les attitudes à l’égard des objectifs d’immigration varient selon le groupe d’âge cible. Les Études (N = 85) et 2 (N = 202) ont examiné cette question au sein d’échantillons canadiens. Elles révèlent que les immigrants âgés étaient perçus plus négativement que les jeunes adultes immigrants. Ces résultats s’expliquent par la croyance que les immigrants âgés auront une incidence négative sur l’économie et qu’ils constitueront un fardeau pour les services publics (c.-à-d., une menace réaliste). En outre, les perceptions à l’égard des personnes âgées non immigrantes étaient aussi plus négatives que celles à l’égard des jeunes adultes non immigrants, ce qui pourrait être attribuable à l’âgisme. Ces résultats révèlent la complexité des attitudes à l’égard des immigrants et suggèrent qu’une pluralité d’identités doit être considérée dans les études de l’évaluation des objectifs d’immigration.

AB  - Objectives: We examined ethnic-racial and gender identities and their relations to self-esteem and well-being among Cherokee early adolescents. We also explored gender differences in the significance to boys and girls of ethnic-racial and gender identities. Method: The sample consisted of 212 Cherokee 6th, 7th, and 8th grade girls and boys (Mage = 12.7 years). Adolescents completed survey measures of gender and ethnic-racial centrality, gender private regard, ethnic-racial private regard, ethnic-racial public regard, self-esteem, and three measures of well-being. Results: Both genders reported high levels of the importance of being Cherokee to their identity (i.e., centrality), and strong positive attitudes toward being Cherokee (i.e., ethnic-racial private regard). Boys perceived gender as more important and more positive than girls. Among girls, ethnic-racial identity was more central and was viewed more positively than their gender identity. Mean levels of ethnic-racial and gender centrality did not differ for boys, nor did their reports of ethnic-racial and gender private regard. Youth's perceptions that others hold Cherokees in high regard (public regard) decreased across the grade levels. For both boys and girls, gender identity dimensions had stronger relations than ethnic-racial identity to psychosocial outcomes. Conclusions: For this sample of Cherokee adolescents, ethnic-racial identity held more prominence for girls than for boys, although aspects of gender identity were more strongly related to well-being for both genders. Results of the study indicate the significance of considering multiple identities in understanding identity development in American Indian adolescents.

Ethnic-racial and gender identities were compared, as well as their relation to psychosocial well-being in a sample of Cherokee adolescent girls and boys. Results revealed the importance of considering multiple social identities, as ethnic-racial and gender identities had differing levels of importance, affect, and relation to psychosocial well-being for girls and boys.

AB  - Objective: Interactions between members of different racial and ethnic groups are often stressful. These interactions are stressful, in part, because they contribute to social identity threat—the fear of being judged or treated negatively based on one’s social group membership. Previous work separately suggests that the diversity of an interaction partner’s friendship network and the goals that people set for themselves influence social identity threat. Bringing these two bodies of work together, the present research examines whether adopting a learning (vs. performance) goal mitigates identity threat for Black people anticipating an interaction with a White partner who had a racially homogenous (vs. diverse) friendship network (a context previously shown to arouse identity threat). Method: Two experimental studies (N = 310) were conducted. Black adults (Mage = 29.66, 64% women) primed with either a performance or learning goal anticipated an interaction with a White partner who had either a racially diverse (Study 1) or racially homogenous (Studies 1 and 2) friendship network. After, we assessed participants’ social identity threat and anticipated interaction experiences. Results: Black adults primed with learning (vs. performance) goals expected to be perceived more positively by their interaction partner and expected to have more positive interaction experiences when they anticipated an interaction with a White partner who had a racially homogenous network of friends. Conclusions: These findings suggest that learning goals can mitigate threat among Black individuals within an otherwise identity-threatening interaction context, thus opening the door for positive interracial contact in the future even in the context of challenging interracial interactions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Public Significance Statement—One of the challenges of a diverse society is that interracial interactions can be difficult and uncomfortable; thus, many people avoid them. Yet, research documents many benefits to a truly integrated society. It is therefore important to investigate strategies that foster more comfortable interactions—even in the context of the most challenging interracial situations. Results from our research suggest that adopting learning (vs. performance) goals may be effective in reducing threat and promoting positive interactions for Black individuals.

AB  - We examined whether zero-sum thinking explains White Australian-born people’s majority-culture perceptions of discrimination towards their ingroup and an outgroup (immigrants), and the relationships among perceived discrimination and support for multiculturalism and immigration. Two correlational cross-sectional studies were conducted among self-identified White Australians (Study 1, N = 517), and White Americans (Study 2, N = 273), as well as an experiment among White Australians (Study 3, N = 121) in which we manipulated discrimination towards immigrants over time. Our findings did not support a zero-sum account but revealed that perceptions of group discrimination were positively correlated: a case of ‘they’re discriminated against, but so are we’ rather than ‘if they gain, we lose’. Moreover, concerns about future discrimination of the ingroup were most predictive of opposition to multicultural policy and immigration. We argue our findings are more consistent with a competitive victimhood account of intergroup relations than a zero-sum thinking account. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - This paper examines how metropolitan contexts of reception shaped immigrants’ experiences of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Drawing on interviews with 32 DACA applicants in metro Houston, we analyze how respondents thought about DACA in relation to their safety and sense of belonging, as well as their educational pathways and professional aspirations. We also examine how they interacted with different local actors and institutions–schools, consulates, civic organizations, and private attorneys and notarios–as they sought help in applying for DACA. We find that undocumented youth in the progressive and more welcoming urban core of metro Houston articulated motivations for applying for DACA that were similar to their counterparts residing in the less diverse and much more heavily policed anti-immigrant suburbs and rural areas ringing the city. Yet DACA applicants in outlying areas, where there were fewer civic organizations and more transportation challenges, found it especially challenging to get DACA application assistance. As a result, they more often turned to expensive attorneys and notarios for help. These findings underscore the need to think of urban, suburban, and rural contexts of reception in relation, and not in isolation, of each other when considering immigrants’ experiences of federal immigration policies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis. © 2020 The British Psychological Society

AB  - This paper argues that social workers must combat historical misinformation, ethnic-racial bias, and narratives of immigrants as threats to advance integrationist immigration policies and immigrant well-being. First, we draw on aLatinx critical theoretical perspective (LatCrit) to expose the role of U.S. immigration policy in the social construction of a large and oppressed Mexican immigrant population that is partially integrated but not legally recognized. Then, we analyze how restrictionist immigration policies violate social work values and human rights and contrast this with an integrationist approach. We conclude with implications for advocacy for integrationist policies and responses to restrictionist policies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The marked increase in the flow of asylum seekers and refugees to nations with white majority cultures is perceived as a crisis that needs to be well managed. The arrival of these ethnic-minority newcomers from countries in Africa, the Middle East, South/Central America and Asia contribute to national security concerns, border protection measures, restrictive immigration policies, everyday anxieties and racism. Australia, however, ‘manages’ the ‘surge’ of these newcomers through institutional practices that recognise their precarity but are oppressive in regulating their freedom to move. This paper engages with the special issue theme of temporariness by centring urban life that shows precarity but also offers brief moments of freedom for refugees and asylum seekers. It focuses on Darwin, a small tropical north Australian city known for its polyethnic history, open-air multicultural markets but also carceral landscapes dotted with prisons, high security detention centres ‘lodges’ and ‘apartments’. The paper draws attention to two weekly activities in public spaces of suburban Darwin that provide brief moments of freedom enabling asylum seekers and refugees to move in the city even though they feel shackled by government laws and policies–‘Football without Borders’ popular among young men; and ‘My Sisters’ Kitchen’, a collective that welcomes women. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A number of homeland security measures have been implemented or proposed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While public opinion polls suggest that some of these measures (e.g., universal security checks) have received widespread support, security policies advanced by President Donald Trump that target Muslims and other immigrant groups are more controversial. These polices have conflated immigration with terrorism and have generated anti–immigrant sentiment in some segments of the American public. In this paper, we utilize national survey data to examine the social sources of public support for national security measures, with a focus on policies that emphasize border control, universal security, reduced civil liberties, discriminatory surveillance, and exclusion. We also determine the extent to which support for policies specific to the Trump administration is driven by Trump’s voter base–White, male, older, southern, Christian, and conservative and assess the influence of anti–immigrant attitudes. Our analyses reveal that the American public favors security measures that are applied universally, and characteristics of Trump’s voter base further predict policy support. Our findings also suggest that support of discriminatory security policies is largely explained by the perception that immigrants are dangerous. We discuss the implications of the anti–immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has stemmed from Trump’s presidential campaign and subsequent administration for national security policies. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Research has shown that positive attitudes towards immigration are often associated with a higher presence of immigrants at the local level; however, this relationship might not apply everywhere. While a higher presence of immigrants might be positive for attitudes in areas with better socioeconomic resources–via the development of more cooperative intergroup contacts–it might bring no or even a negative effect on attitudes in poorer areas–due to an enhanced competition for (scarce) resources and poorer social cohesion. This article combines data from the European Social Survey with NUTS3 aggregated data of twelve European countries to study this relationship. We find that a higher concentration of immigrants is associated with more positive attitudes towards them; in line with our expectations, this effect decreases as the socioeconomic conditions of areas worsen. In the most deprived areas, however, a higher concentration of immigrants does not have an effect on attitudes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Significant research depicts the implications of sport’s role in racial formation located mainly in the ‘Global North’. Yet, there has been less attention afforded to the related role of sport in the ‘Global South’, particularly in divided societies, where the consequences of sports’ influence on ethno-racial relations, are also significant. This study relies on empirical evidence gathered during an in-depth exploration into the role of soccer and rugby in Fijian intergroup relations. Sport is analysed as an arena that not only plays host to ethno-racial groupings but one which is also instrumental in their maintenance and reimagining. In Fiji at least, the organisation and positioning of sport in popular culture and discourse means that it becomes an emblematic sphere, active in the reconfirmation and preservation of ethno-racial division. Through this discussion, this study contributes to sport and racial formation theory, widening the gaze to diverse and divided socio-cultural settings. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

It seeks to gain insight into themes and issues emerging in the cultural contact of (re)migrants with Turks back in Turkey and to elucidate the dimensions of the perceived stigmatization of Turkish (re)migrants. By using an original survey instrument, the items of which were generated based on the semi-structured interviews with 53 informants, data were collected from 606 Turkish informants. Based on the survey results, a model was developed and validated. The results of the study are discussed within the frameworks of intergroup relations and social categorization of the social identity approach. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the context of ongoing debate about the positive and negative consequences of ethnic diversity for intergroup relations, we study inter-ethnic relations among adolescents in England’s schools. In the first national study of schools throughout England to relate inter-ethnic attitudes to both school and area ethnic composition, we combine survey data collected from 14-year-olds in nearly 100 schools with administrative data. We focus on relations between three ethno-racial categories: White-British, Asian-British and Black-British, for three conceptually distinct indicators of inter-ethnic orientations: warmth, friends, and attitudes. We posit that ‘contact’, proxied by school outgroup composition, should lead to more positive intergroup orientations, while ‘exposure’, proxied by neighbourhood outgroup composition, should lead to more negative intergroup relations. We show that higher school outgroup shares are associated with more positive orientations towards that group for almost all relationships and measures. We further show that for the two instances where higher school outgroup shares do not enhance positive intergroup orientations, they nevertheless moderate negative effects of neighbourhood composition. We conclude that schools offer the opportunity to enhance intergroup relations and to mitigate the threats associated with increased neighbourhood diversity with potentially enduring consequences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since the late 1990s, populist discourse based on anti-immigration sentiments has been on the rise in Britain. This phenomenon reached a peak during the EU Referendum (ER) campaign and shortly thereafter. The ER has been linked to the upsurge in racially and religiously aggravated offences recorded post-July 2016. Polish nationals, who constitute the largest group of EU nationals in the UK, were targeted by many of these incidents. It could therefore be argued that, in the last years, and particularly, since the ER, EU nationals living in the UK have become more ‘vulnerable’. To test this hypothesis, this contribution is based on an interdisciplinary project that collected socio-legal evidence to compare the vulnerability of the Polish community in Southampton before and after the ER. The paper draws on vulnerability and psychology literature to differentiate between ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ vulnerability. Our study deploys mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) to test changes in objective and subjective vulnerability among Southampton-based Poles before and after the ER. Our findings suggest that, following the ER, Poles felt significantly more vulnerable, especially in terms of subjective vulnerability, even if they had never experienced overt hate incidents or discrimination (objective vulnerability) before. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Humans generally fear those different to them (i.e., an out-group) in the same way they fear natural predators. But fear pushes us to derogate others, whether they constitute a threat or not. Research has examined how fear associated with specific intergroup relations interferes with how individuals relate to in-group and out-group members. However, we know relatively little about how intergroup relations might be affected by incidental emotions. We tested how incidental fear affects empathy toward in-group and out-group members. We found that exposing participants to fearful imagery was sufficient to reduce empathy, but only in response to out-group suffering. We discuss how these findings provide insight into how fear is often leveraged to encourage social tribalism.

AB  - To gain insights into whether schools striving to improve intergroup dynamics should curb disliking or facilitate liking across students of different ethnic groups, the current study examines the associations between interpersonal affect and intergroup relations in multiethnic schools. Given (i.e., outgoing) peer nominations of liked and disliked grade-mates were coded by ethnicity in 26 public middle schools, including all Asian, Black, Latinx, and White students (N = 4,350). Controlling for earlier intergroup attitudes and the availability of ethnic ingroup and relevant outgroup grade-mates, multilevel analyses show that liking (but not disliking) of cross-ethnic grade-mates was associated with more positive attitudes toward that particular ethnic group. Implications of these findings for intergroup relations among adolescents in multiethnic schools are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The literature on intergroup contact has mainly focused on how the majority group members reduce negative stereotypes and prejudice toward minority groups, also exploring the dynamics of intergroup contact in Western countries. The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamics of intergroup contact and interactions from the perspective of Western immigrants, and to understand how they interact with host individuals in South Korea. Using a constructivist grounded theory, three themes were identified associated with intergroup contact: (a) experiencing cultural growth and cultural conflicts, (b) reducing ethnocentric behaviors, and (c) experiencing cultural distance and boundaries. This study suggests that participants experienced the dynamics of intergroup contact with the host individuals. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Are male and female immigrants viewed similarly or differently? Consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective, we suggest that the answer to this question depends upon what types of threats immigrant groups are perceived as posing. In the present study, we compared attitudes toward male and female immigrants from either a violent ecology (e.g., Syria) or a pathogen-rich ecology (e.g., Liberia). We hypothesized that people would have more negative attitudes toward male than female immigrants from a violent ecology, but that attitudes would be similar toward male and female immigrants from a pathogen-rich ecology. Internal meta-analyses of three studies (total N = 1,488) were in line with our hypothesis. They showed that attitudes toward male immigrants from a violent ecology were more negative than attitudes toward female immigrants from the same ecology. In contrast, attitudes toward male and female immigrants were similar when those immigrants came from a pathogen-rich ecology. Our findings are consistent with an evolutionary threat management perspective on outgroup prejudice and are aligned with the male warrior hypothesis: Attitudes toward male versus female outgroup members vary with the potential threats these outgroups pose. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Although immigration is one of key issues facing European societies today, many survey respondents do not reply to questions about immigration and ethnic minorities. Using data from the 2014 European Social Survey, this paper explores the characteristics of nonrespondents and the potential mechanisms which might lie behind their refraining from answering immigration-related questions. Item nonresponse to seven questions on the impact of immigration (impact items) and six questions on allowing ethnic/racial/religious minorities into the respondent’s country (openness items) is analysed. The results indicate that nonresponse to these items is systematically related to respondents’ profiles, their experiences, the characteristics of the interviewer, and the country context. Respondents with a moderate amount of contact with ethnic minorities and who are interested in politics are least uncertain about their attitudes and most likely to report them. Contrary to expectations, nonresponse is not lowest among the more educated–indeed, the nonresponse rate for the openness items is highest for the most highly educated. The results also point to the importance of the interviewer effect, as nonresponse to immigration-related items varies more between interviewers than between countries. The paper concludes by highlighting the implications for the design and analysis of surveys measuring attitudes towards immigration. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Many U.S. cities pursue a “human relations” strategy in response to racial and ethnic group conflict. Reflective of Common Ingroup Identity theory, human relations practitioners emphasize a superordinate community identity among residents from different groups for the purpose of “bringing people together” in an effort to improve intergroup relations. Practitioners also encourage intergroup contact to promote positive change in attitudes. Herein, we test the influence of group identity cues and intergroup contact as predictors of perceived intergroup commonality. The findings suggest emphasizing a superordinate community identity increases feelings of commonality in the attitudes of Anglos and Latinos toward one another and toward African-Americans and Asians, while intergroup contact has no significant influence on intergroup attitudes. These findings contribute to the extant literature by simultaneously testing the relative effect of salient group identities on intergroup attitudes and expanding the focus beyond the binary comparison found in most studies of racial–ethnic relations. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - This study investigates how personality relates to citizens’ willingness to extend political, social, and cultural rights for minorities, including voting rights for immigrants, religious rights for Muslims, and affirmative action measures. Moving beyond explanations centred on intergroup relations, we argue that political efficacy (i.e. beliefs about personal political competences and the responsiveness of political elites) operates as a mechanism linking personality and policy preferences on minority rights. We test these arguments using mediation models on data from a large-N survey conducted in Germany in 2016. Results show that high openness, high agreeableness, and low conscientiousness predict permissive views on minority rights. In addition to indirect effects via group-specific attitudes, we find empirical support for substantial links via political efficacy. In particular, people high in conscientiousness or high in neuroticism have lower faith in government responsiveness, which in turn is related to less willingness to approve minority rights. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Much of the current literature on racial/ethnic bias in healthcare focuses on practitioners’ implicit biased attitudes regarding patients, identifying it as a factor contributing to health disparities. Little attention has been paid, however, to patients’ bias against practitioners from other ethnic group. Aim: To explore patients’ bias towards practitioners from other ethnic group. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted during 2018 with 38 Israeli Jewish and Arab patients. Findings: While many participants (more Jews than Arabs) reported that they perceive medical treatment as neutral and value the physician’s professionalism and attitude, others (more Arabs than Jews) attested that they do prefer to be treated by physicians of their own ethnic group. Jewish patients who prefer Jewish physicians described bias against Arab physicians: Feelings of fear and distrust, particularly in light of the conflictual situation in Israel. They also considered Arab physicians less professional than Jewish ones. Arab patients who prefer Arab physicians described their need for culturally and linguistically competent healthcare and praised close informal relations with Arab physicians, contrasting them with past offensive and humiliating experiences with Jewish physicians. Conclusions: Findings reveal several factors that impact Jewish and Arab Israeli patients’ preference for patient–physician concordance, some of which reflect patients’ implicit bias. This phenomenon–together with practitioners’ implicit bias against patients–should be recognized as contributing to the ambiguity of ethnic relations in clinical encounters, particularly in conflictual societies. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - At least two theories have been offered that explain the rise of affective polarization. Some scholars, relying on social identity theory, argue that as the relevance of party identification increased, Americans became more likely to see their in-party in positive terms and the out-party in negative terms. Other scholars argue that affective polarization is a reaction to increasingly extreme political actors. This study seeks to arbitrate between these two theories of affective polarization through a survey experiment which asks respondents to rate candidates whose party (or lack thereof) and ideology (or lack thereof) is randomly assigned. In line with the policy-oriented view of affective polarization, respondents reacted far more strongly to ideology than party, especially if it was the ideology of the member of the out-party. © 2019 The European Political Science Association.

AB  - This study claims that collective memory has implications for attitudes toward immigration and, particularly, toward refugees and asylum seekers and adds to the factors that shape public opinion on immigration. By using the case of collective memory of the Holocaust in Israel, it examines whether different interpretations of a historical event like the Holocaust are related to attitudes toward asylum seekers and asks specifically: (1) Does collective memory, in the form of particularist and universalist Holocaust ‘lessons,’ affect attitudes toward asylum seekers?; and (2) Can the collective memory of the Holocaust be mobilised to shape attitudes toward asylum seekers? In study 1 (N = 573) a cross-sectional survey of Israeli Jews finds that universalist or particularist beliefs regarding the ‘lessons’ of the Holocaust explain attitudes toward asylum seekers, even beyond the effect of perceived threat. Results from a survey experiment (Study 2, N = 487) about evoking the memory of the Holocaust in order to reduce exclusionist attitudes provide additional insights about the differential impact of Holocaust ‘lessons’ on these attitudes. The mobilisation of collective memory varies across different interpretations of these ‘lessons.’ This study points to the need to include collective memory when analyzing the factors that shape attitudes toward immigrants. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate beliefs, and attitudes about health of refugees with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and posttraumatic stress disorder and the consequent effects on self-care in comparison to resident populations. Design: A systematic review methodology was used. PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases were searched for relevant articles. The main terms analysed were health beliefs, chronic conditions and refugee populations. From 844 articles, 45 were retained for further assessment, and finally 5 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Differences in the health beliefs, attitudes and self-care management approaches of refugees compared to resident populations were identified in two studies. The remaining three papers did not make comparisons between the refugees and the resident population, nor did they specifically explore the refugees’ health beliefs. Of the five studies, three were carried out in Sweden and two in the US. Refugees who have poorer mental and physical health as well as higher prevalence of chronic diseases than the populations among which they resettle seem to lack the knowledge about their illness, symptoms and self-management and thus are less able to control their chronic conditions. Conclusion: The findings highlighted the deficiency in the literature of studies which examine health beliefs and attitudes of minority groups such as refugees who have chronic conditions. The findings also gave insight to the need for a distinctive understanding of refugee health and the management of chronic conditions in comparison to other non-refugee migrant groups. Further research is needed to fully understand the differences between refugees and local populations in terms health beliefs, chronic disease and self-management. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Despite a rich literature on the factors influencing the public opinion on immigration, less is known about the top-down effects of political parties and policies on the public’s preferences in this domain. We analyse in this paper the impact of political parties’ positions and of immigration policies on citizens’ attitudes toward immigration. We are interested in the effects of public policy understood both in terms of policy regime, that is, country specific regulations on immigration, and policy outcomes, such as the stocks of immigrant population. The results we obtain, based on data covering twenty-three European countries during the period 2002–2011, point to the existence of top-down influences on citizens’ immigration attitudes. © 2018 Elections, Public Opinion & Parties.

AB  - This study explores the contribution of selected demographic variables (gender, age, socioeconomic status), attitudes toward social workers (SWs) and trust in them, stigma attached to seeking help from SWs, and knowledge of SWs’ professional roles, to the likelihood that immigrants from the former Soviet Union (FSU) in their second or third decade in Israel would seek the professional help of SWs. Structured questionnaires were administered to 217 FSU immigrants. Greater knowledge of SWs’ professional roles, more positive attitudes toward SWs, greater trust in them, and lower levels of stigma were associated with a greater self-reported likelihood of seeking help from SWs. Yet, none of the demographic variables significantly predicted this variable. The conclusion is that SWs must take a proactive approach and initiate contact with FSU immigrants, as well as educational and informational programs intended to help FSU immigrants overcome the barriers to seeking professional help from SWs. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
