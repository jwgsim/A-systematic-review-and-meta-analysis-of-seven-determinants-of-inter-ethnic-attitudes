T1  - The imaginary friends of my friends: Imagined contact interventions which highlight supportive social norms reduce children’s antirefugee bias: GPIR
AN  - 2693010296
AB  - Fostering inclusive attitudes among children in host classrooms is key to integrating refugee children. A field experiment tests the prejudice reduction effects of a teacher-led activity integrating imagined intergroup contact and normative influence. To enhance the effectiveness of imagined contact, scenarios include supportive ingroup norms. In 29 classes, 545 children (Mage = 10.88, SD = 0.96) were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: standard imagined contact, imagined contact encouraged by family, class peers, or religious ingroups, or a control. Children in all norm-framed imagined contact conditions had significantly less antirefugee bias compared with the control. The class-peer norm frame significantly reduced affective and cognitive facets of bias. The family norm frame reduced affective bias, and the religious norm frame reduced cognitive bias. Standard imagined contact did not differ from the control. Potential mediating pathways are explored. These findings illustrate the utility of incorporating norms into imagined contact interventions to reduce antirefugee bias among schoolchildren.

T1  - Dynamic contact effects: Individuals' positive and negative contact history influences intergroup contact effects in a behavioral game
AN  - 2681521208
AB  - Positive contact between members of different groups reduces prejudice and increases cooperation, findings known as intergroup contact effects. Yet in real-world settings not only positive, but also negative intergroup contact occurs, which have opposing effects. To date little is known about whether and how an individual's valenced history of intergroup contact influences contact effects and how this dynamic change happens during specific instances of intergroup contact. A pilot study examined the psychological impact of a novel paradigm to assess intergroup contact using a behavioral game. We then conducted two studies, which allowed us to observe a sequence of up to 23 in- and outgroup interactions and their behavioral outcomes in a continuous prisoner's dilemma behavioral game (N = 116, 2,668 interactions; N = 89, 1,513 interactions). As expected, participants showed a clear ingroup bias in expectations and cooperation. Furthermore, the quality of contact history moderated contact effects. Specifically, intergroup contact following a positive history of intergroup contact had a stronger effect on intergroup expectations than contact following a negative history thereof. Findings are discussed in view of the importance of considering the valenced history of intergroup contact, as well as new research questions on intergroup contact that can be addressed with this novel contact paradigm.

T1  - Professional preference for mental illness: The role of contact, empathy, and stigma in Spanish Social Work undergraduates
AN  - 2673562969
AB  - The treatment of the mentally ill people is a challenge across the world, and different professionals, such as doctors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses, take care of this group. Nonetheless, mental health is not a vocational sector preferred by students and professionals of many of these careers. Research has proposed that professional preference for a patient group would be positively influenced by intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and empathy (perspective‐taking), and negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and social distance. However, the evidence testing this proposal was partial and mainly referring to other patient groups such as minorities or immigrants. The major aim of this cross‐sectional study was to clarify two research questions referring to mentally ill persons: Do contact and empathy protect undergraduates from intergroup anxiety and social distance and promote professional preference? Do intergroup anxiety and social distance predict professional preference and mediate the influence of contact and empathy in professional preference? A convenience sample of 409 Social Work undergraduates (81% females) from three Spanish universities completed a questionnaire between February and June 2020. Concerning direct relationships, the structural equation model showed that the quantity of contact only predicted intergroup anxiety negatively; quality of contact and empathy negatively predicted intergroup anxiety and social distance; intergroup anxiety positively predicted social distance; intergroup anxiety and social distance negatively predicted professional preference. Concerning mediated relationships, the influence of quality of contact and empathy on social distance was mediated by intergroup anxiety; social distance mediated the relationship of intergroup anxiety with professional preference; both anxiety and distance mediated the influence of quality of contact and empathy in professional preference. These results encourage interventions aimed at enhancing professional preference for mental illness by improving contact, knowledge, and empathy and reducing stigma in students and workers from diverse mental health careers.

T1  - Stay humble and enjoy diversity: The interplay between intergroup contact and cultural humility on prejudice
AN  - 2695089098
AB  - Despite the effectiveness of intergroup contact in reducing prejudice, opportunities for contact are not always associated with positive mutual intergroup perceptions. This might be due, at least partly, to negative contact, i.e., intergroup encounters perceived as unpleasant, and to individual characteristics which might shape reactions to opportunities for contact and to actual contact. Here we considered cultural humility, i.e., a subdomain of humility referring to the ability to have a humble and other-oriented approach to others' cultures. We propose that cultural humility might orient individuals to successfully and non-judgmentally interact with outgroup members. Therefore, cultural humility might be associated with positive contact and with reduced negative contact, and might favor beneficial effects of opportunities for contact in terms of prejudice reduction. In a cross-sectional study conducted among Italian participants considering immigrants and Muslims as outgroups, we found that cultural humility was associated with positive contact and with reduced negative contact. Furthermore, opportunities for contact were associated with negative contact only among respondents with low cultural humility. Cultural humility also moderated the valenced contact-prejudice associations. However, disconfirming our predictions, positive contact was associated with reduced prejudice mainly for people with low cultural humility, while negative contact was associated with more prejudice mainly for people with high cultural humility. Findings will be discussed emphasizing the role of cultural humility for intergroup contact and the possible contribution of cultural humility training to foster harmonious intergroup relations.

T1  - Decentring the Majority–Minority Paradigm: A Multidimensional Conceptualization of Inter-ethnic Relations Based on a Study of Chinese Canadians
AN  - 2628405967
AB  - Inter-ethnic research has been dominated by studies on majority–minority relations. The limited studies on relations among ethnic minority groups are usually restricted to a focus on attitudes and the cognitive domain, with little attention to actual behaviours. As Canada becomes increasingly diverse, it calls for a greater need in examining the interpersonal relationships among ethnic minority groups. A study originally designed to look at intra-group dynamics generated results that led the authors to decentre the dominant majority–minority view and explore inter-ethnic engagements. This report examines the subjective sense-making, actual performance, and management of inter-ethnic relations from Chinese Canadians’ perspectives. Data from individual interviews and focus groups with thirty-five Chinese Canadians show a multidimensional picture: factors such as participants’ needs, circumstances, characteristics, and capacities play a more significant role in shaping relationship development and maintenance. Results also reveal the complex and contingent nature of the sense-making and management of inter-ethnic relationships. These findings call for a more holistic view of individuals’ experiences that include cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions.

T1  - Cultural intelligence and social distance among undergraduate students in clinical professions: GPIR
AN  - 2638250844
AB  - Cultural competence, also known as cultural intelligence (CQ), is considered a necessary skill in the clinical professions and for resolving intergroup conflict, yet it has not been examined within the framework of the contact hypothesis. The aim of the present research is to extend CQ theory from management to the clinical professions and examine it in a context of intergroup conflict. The present study examined CQ and social distance among entering undergraduate majority (Jewish) and minority (Arab) students in clinical study domains, hypothesizing that CQ will be negatively associated with social distance towards outgroup members and that minority students will report higher CQ than majority students. First-year students (N = 180) from diverse demographic and study domains (social work, nursing, behavioral sciences) were surveyed. The results reveal a novel negative association between CQ and outgroup social distance, and higher CQ among minority-group students. The finding that students from minority backgrounds were more receptive to intercultural exchange at the outset of their training suggests that CQ theory could be used in training and evaluation criteria of students entering clinical professional training.

T1  - Social dominance orientation in children: The validation of the long and short version of the child SDO<sub>6</sub> scale
AN  - 2628402040
AB  - We aimed to validate a long and a short version of the popular SDO6 scale for children, by testing their reliability and factorial structure, as well as divergent and criterion validity. Italian fourth- and fifth-graders (N = 271; 49.45% female) were administered the Child SDO6 scale, composed of 16 items, along with a series of personality and intergroup relations measures (using foreigners as the minority group). Paralleling results obtained with adults, findings concerning the short version provided evidence for a two-factorial structure, consisting of an SDO-Dominance and an SDO-Anti-egalitarianism dimension. Both for the long and the short version, greater levels of SDO-Dominance and SDO-Anti-egalitarianism were associated with more neuroticism, attitudinal and stereotypic bias, and with less agreeableness, openness to experience, dispositional and intergroup empathy. In conclusions, the two SDO dimensions as assessed by the short Child SDO6 Scale may be relevant variables to consider when testing intergroup relations processes among children.

T1  - Stereotypes in the face of reality: Intergroup contact inconsistent with group stereotypes changes attitudes more than stereotype-consistent contact: GPIR
AN  - 2609042280
AB  - In a longitudinal two-wave study we examined the effects of positive and negative intergroup contact on outgroup attitudes in participants who perceived positive, negative, or ambivalent group stereotypes. We focused on stereotype-consistent contact, occurring when the valence of participants’ contact matches the valence of the perceived group stereotype (e.g., negative–negative), and on stereotype-inconsistent contact, occurring when the valence of contact contradicts the valence of the group stereotype (e.g., positive–negative). In relations of the Czech majority (N = 890) with two distinctly stereotyped minorities, the Roma and the Vietnamese, stereotype-inconsistent contact predicted changes in attitudes better than stereotype-consistent contact. In the case of negatively stereotyped groups, positive intergroup contact is a viable way to improve attitudes. For positively stereotyped groups, negative contact can worsen attitudes, while positive contact does not have any attitude-improving effect. Interventions aimed at improving outgroup attitudes need to be applied with caution, considering the valence of group stereotypes.

T1  - Evidence of a dynamic association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence: GPIR
AN  - 2609041392
AB  - Three studies explored the association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence. Study 1 and Study 2 provided evidence of a cross-sectional association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence in which positive contact was associated with increased intercultural competence and negative contact was associated with reductions in this outcome. In Study 3, longitudinal data allowed us to test the possibility of mutual influence between these variables whereby intercultural competence is not only a consequence of intergroup contact but is also predictive of the quality of future intergroup contact. Results showed that positive contact was longitudinally associated with improvements in intercultural competence, and that higher intercultural competence was associated with a reduction in future negative contact. Findings speak to the importance of taking a dynamic outlook on contact effects. The beneficial consequences of positive contact may be the same variables capable of transforming future contact encounters and reducing the likelihood of negative interactions.

T1  - Conditional secondary transfer effect: The moderating role of moral credentials and prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2583831570
AB  - This survey experiment examined the role of prejudice and moral licensing as two moderators of the secondary transfer effect (STE) of positive and negative intergroup contact. We collected a quota-randomized sample of 299 majority Finns (52.6% female; experimental condition: n = 118, control condition: n = 181) in order to test whether moral credentials prevent attitude generalization (from primary towards secondary outgroup), particularly among prejudiced individuals. The results showed that STEs of both positive and negative contact were prevented among more prejudiced majority group members who had the possibility to obtain moral credentials in the moral licensing task. These results point at the unstable nature of attitude generalization in STE among prejudiced individuals and at the potential of a normative moral act to intervene into the generalization of intergroup attitudes following intergroup contact. We discuss these findings in relation to the literature on moral licensing and moral reinforcement, framing them in the context of an integration of contact research and research on morality in general.

T1  - The onset of COVID-19, common identity, and intergroup prejudice
AN  - 2556552530
AB  - The research presented here examined the relationship between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social group identity, intergroup contact, and prejudice. Utilizing a common ingroup identity approach, two datasets, which were composed of data from university students collected via online questionnaires before and after the onset of COVID-19, were combined (N = 511). Participants identified as either one of two subordinate student identities: domestic (i.e. U.S. citizen or permanent resident) or international (i.e. non-U.S. citizen or foreign resident), then reported on the strength of their subordinate and superordinate identity (university identity). Participants also reported on their contact experiences with outgroup members, outgroup stereotypes, and completed a novel intergroup bias task. Results indicated that after the onset of the pandemic, participants more strongly identified with the superordinate group, which predicted greater perceived intergroup contact and lower intergroup bias. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - The last acceptable prejudice in Europe? Anti-Gypsyism as the obstacle to Roma inclusion: GPIR
AN  - 2513520464
AB  - National and European policies aim to facilitate the integration of Roma people into mainstream society. Yet, Europe’s largest ethnic group continues to be severely discriminated. Although prejudice has been identified to be at the core of this failure, social psychological research on anti-Gypsyism remains scarce. We conducted a study in six countries using student and community samples (N = 2,089; Hungary, Romania, Slovakia, Norway, Italy, Spain) to understand how anti-Gypsyism among majority-group members predicts unfavorable acculturation preferences toward Roma people. Openly negative stereotypes predicted acculturation preferences strongly across the countries. However, stereotypes about the Roma receiving undeserved benefits were also relevant to some degree in East-Central Europe, implying that intergroup relations are framed there as realistic conflict. Stereotypes about traditional Roma culture did not play a central role in acculturation preferences. Our findings highlighted that anti-Gypsyism may be an impediment to integration efforts, and efforts should be context-specific rather than pan-national.

T1  - The dynamic relationship between contact opportunities, positive and negative intergroup contact, and prejudice: A longitudinal investigation
AN  - 2488069752
AB  - We investigated the dynamics of naturally increasing contact opportunities, frequencies of positive and negative intergroup contact experiences, and prejudice toward forced migrants, in 2 three-wave longitudinal studies (Study 1, N = 183, adult community sample; Study 2, N = 758, nation-wide adult probability sample) in Germany using latent growth curve and parallel process analyses. We examined (research question 1) whether prejudice increases or decreases with increased contact opportunities; (research question 2) whether the rate of change in prejudice is related to the rate of change of positive/negative contact; (research question 3) whether the trajectories of change in prejudice shift as a function of the histories of prior positive/negative contact; and (research question 4) whether the rate of change in positive/negative contact frequencies depends on prior prejudice levels. Across both studies, prejudice increased with increased contact opportunities, as did positive and negative contact frequencies (ad research question 1). Whereas changes in negative contact were significantly related to changes in prejudice in both studies, no such relationships emerged as significant for positive contact (ad research question 2). We did not find any supportive evidence for our research questions 3 and 4. Overall, our results demonstrate that increased contact opportunities can contribute to increases in prejudice. Moreover, they indicate that the trajectories of negative contact and prejudice may be more substantially intertwined than the trajectories of positive contact and prejudice.

T1  - Introduction: Fighting for Security from a Minor Perspective and Against Securitisation of Minorities in Europe
AN  - 2568035005
AB  - Sharing spaces among different ethnic, religious, and cultural groups in diverse societies is a major problem globally, particularly for minority communities, as states are often inclined to perceive minorities and indigenous groups as a threat, meaning that their presence evokes a sense of insecurity. This attitude departs from a premise that "[s]ecurity is about what is a threat..." (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 204), which means that the societal inclination towards "[p]ursuit about the freedom of threat" (Buzan, 2008, p. 37) determines approaches towards minorities. However, security should not be considered as a reverse of insecurity, although "...[h]ow security is defined conditions what is considered as insecurity (risk, threat)" (C.A.S.E., 2006, p. 257). Perceiving minorities as threat is often reflected in the state policy agenda; it affects representation and leads to unfair competition and negative attitudes of majority groups towards minorities that easily turn into other forms of injustices and discrimination (European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, 2005). As a result, minorities can be exposed to exclusionist political attitudes, discriminatory or xenophobic attacks, and intolerance or violence by a majority group (Côté & Erickson, 2009; Dustmann & Preston, 2001; Vergeer et al., 2000).

T1  - Re-examining public opinion preferences for migrant categorizations: "Refugees" are evaluated more negatively than "migrants" and "foreigners" related to participants' direct, extended, and mass-mediated intergroup contact experiences
AN  - 2516239665
AB  - Although migrant categorizations (e.g. "migrants", "refugees") are often conflated in political and academic discourse, they may be ascribed to different people and inspire different preferences in public opinion. Previous research in Western Europe has identified more positive attitudes toward "refugees" than toward "migrants" due to the legitimate need for international protection of "real refugees" compared to the perceived illegitimate claims by "economic migrants". However, little evidence suggests that the same preference also exists in Eastern European countries that have historically received smaller numbers of refugees and had fewer frequent experiences with migrants and foreigners compared to West European countries. Moreover, the term "refugee" was intensively recategorized as "bogus" and de-legitimized in East European political discourse. To provide new evidence, we conducted a pre-registered comparative survey-based study with a sample of young Slovak adults (N = 873) to compare evaluations of three commonly used migrant categorizations in Slovakia - "refugees", "migrants", and "foreigners" - on multiple attitudinal and behavioural measures. In addition, we also tested the intergroup contact hypothesis about the relationship between participants' evaluations and their experiences of direct, extended, and mass-mediated contact with these target groups. We found that "refugees" invoked less favourable feelings, attitudes, trust, and greater social distance compared to "migrants" and "foreigners". These evaluations related to the valence (and less to the quantity) of participants' experience of intergroup contact. These results challenge previous findings about public opinion preferences for "refugees" over "migrants", support the intergroup contact hypothesis, and make a case for a more contextualized research.

T1  - Koreans' attitudes toward China and Chinese people: The effect of direct contact experience
AN  - 2512819498
AB  - Although the number of Chinese immigrants moving to South Korea has increased in the past decade Koreans still hold negative attitudes toward China and the Chinese populace. To discover whether this prejudice can be reduced, we examined the effect of direct contact with Chinese people on Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people. Participants in our study were 91 Korean university students who were divided into two groups based on their contact experience with people from China. The contact group (n = 43) and the noncontact group (n = 48) both completed a cultural experience questionnaire, the Explicit Attitude Questionnaire, and the Implicit Association Test. According to the results, the contact group displayed more positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people than did the noncontact group. These findings suggest that it may be possible to improve Koreans' perception of China and relations with Chinese people by increasing direct contact experience between the two communities.

T1  - Bringing People Together: Improving Intergroup Relations via Group Identity Cues
AN  - 2473378584
AB  - Many U.S. cities pursue a “human relations” strategy in response to racial and ethnic group conflict. Reflective of Common Ingroup Identity theory, human relations practitioners emphasize a superordinate community identity among residents from different groups for the purpose of “bringing people together” in an effort to improve intergroup relations. Practitioners also encourage intergroup contact to promote positive change in attitudes. Herein, we test the influence of group identity cues and intergroup contact as predictors of perceived intergroup commonality. The findings suggest emphasizing a superordinate community identity increases feelings of commonality in the attitudes of Anglos and Latinos toward one another and toward African-Americans and Asians, while intergroup contact has no significant influence on intergroup attitudes. These findings contribute to the extant literature by simultaneously testing the relative effect of salient group identities on intergroup attitudes and expanding the focus beyond the binary comparison found in most studies of racial–ethnic relations.

T1  - Threat to national identity continuity: When affirmation procedures increase the acceptance of Muslim immigrants
AN  - 2506626094
AB  - European majority group members increasingly perceive threats to national continuity, which in turn leads to defensive reactions, including prejudice against Muslim immigrants. However, according to self-affirmation theory, individuals can respond in a less defensive manner if they have affirmed positive aspects of their self-concept (self-affirmation) or their social identity (group-affirmation). In the present research, we test the potential of affirmation procedures as tools for reducing prejudice towards Muslim immigrants when national continuity is threatened. We examine the impact of personal vs. normative attachment to Christian roots of national identity on the efficacy of affirmation procedures, and the congruence between the threatened and the affirmed domains of the self. Results show that group-affirmation reduced opposition to Muslims' rights amongst participants personally attached to the idea that national continuity is based on Christian roots. The discussion stresses the importance of non-congruence between the threatened domain of the self and the affirmed domain for the design of affirmation procedures.

T1  - Don’t hurt my outgroup friend: A multifaceted form of imagined contact promotes intentions to counteract bullying: GPIR
AN  - 2429520944
AB  - A growing body of research has shown that imagined intergroup contact can improve outgroup attitudes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted form of imagined contact in counteracting bullying in school children, and additionally to test the underlying processes of this effect. Two hundred and fifteen Italian elementary school children took part in a 3-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine a scenario in which they become friends with an unknown disabled child, interact in various social settings, and react to forms of discrimination toward the newly acquired friend. After each session, they discussed collectively what they had imagined. The dependent measures were administered 1 week after the last session. Results revealed that inclusion of an outgroup member in the self mediated the effect of imagined contact on intentions to counteract social exclusion and bullying of disabled children, as well as helping intentions. Imagined contact also promoted greater willingness for outgroup contact via more positive outgroup attitudes and empathy. Our findings are important in delineating new forms of imagined contact, and understanding ways to promote behaviors that defend victims of social exclusion and bullying in school environments.

T1  - Together we stand? Belonging motive moderates the effect of national ingroup salience on attitudes towards ethnic minorities
AN  - 2476846101
AB  - Common ingroup categorization reduces outgroup prejudice. This link is moderated by distinctiveness motives (i.e., individuals perceiving this identity as too inclusive). Yet, Optimal Distinctiveness Theory states that both distinctiveness and belonging motives shape intergroup attitudes. For the first time we tested the hypothesis that belonging and distinctiveness motives jointly moderate common ingroup categorization effects. Using a flag-priming paradigm, two studies showed that, when national ingroup identity was salient, only belonging motives predicted positive attitudes towards outgroups (Studyl: Syrians in Turkey, N = 184; Study 2: Maghrebis in France N = 151). This was corroborated by sensitivity analyses on aggregated data (N = 335). These results suggest that national identification may lead to positive outgroup attitudes for individuals who derive belonging from it.

T1  - A Journey Researching Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2404395244
AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author's 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous, African Canadians, Francophone minorities in EnglishCanada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Leçon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide.

T1  - Indirect contact in social networks: Challenging common interpretations of the extended contact hypothesis: GPIR
AN  - 2390112440
AB  - According to the extended contact hypothesis, direct intergroup contact is not necessary for prejudice reduction; it suffices to know that ingroup friends have outgroup friends. However, extended contact is typically measured in a way that does not clarify whether people know the outgroup friend of their ingroup friend or whether they are even direct friends. A social network approach is used to compare extended contact when ingroup friends’ outgroup friends are not direct friends (open triads) to when there is a direct friendship with some (mixed triads) or all of the ingroup friends’ outgroup friends (closed triads). Results from a nonprobability sample in the US predicting feelings toward Black people (N = 313) and from a representative sample in the Netherlands predicting attitudes toward immigrants (N = 818) show that extended contact reduces prejudice only when some of the outgroup friends of one’s ingroup friends are known. This suggests that the extended contact effect should not be interpreted as providing a solution for situations where direct contact with outgroup members is not possible.

T1  - Intergroup fears and concerns among minority and majority groups: Implications for contact and attitudes
AN  - 2383837534
AB  - AimsDriven by the literature on pluralistic ignorance, our research investigates fear of appearing racist, being rejected, discriminated, and disinterest in intergroup contact as antecedents of contact and outgroup attitudes, focusing on attributional differences between the majority and minority group perspectives.MethodsQuestionnaires were distributed in schools in Northern Italy. Participants were 400 Italian and 141 immigrant high‐school students.ResultsThe results showed that the lack of interest in contact was the strongest predictor of contact for the majority group. For the minority group, fear of rejection emerged as the strongest predictor. The majority group attributed the minority to avoid contact most strongly due to the fear that they would be rejected, and the minority group perceived it was due to the majority not being interested in contact.ConclusionOur research contributes to understanding the divergent concerns the majority and minority groups have in relation to intergroup contact and discusses the importance of tackling these concerns.

T1  - Preferred Parental Control of Mate Choice, Opposition to Out-Group Mating, and Ethnic Identification in Surinam
AN  - 2375721506
AB  - This study examined the attitude toward parental control of mate choice, and two potential factors related to this, that is, opposition to out-group mating and ethnic identification, in the five major ethnic groups from the Republic of Surinam (n = 500), that is, Hindustani, Creoles, Maroons, Javanese, and people of Mixed descent. Some of the main differences between groups were the following: Hindustani and Maroons had a more positive attitude toward parental control than all other groups, Hindustani were more opposed to out-group mating than all other groups, and Maroons expressed more identification with their ethnic group than any other group. Women, as compared with men, valued parental control of mate choice more and expressed more opposition to out-group mating. All effects of ethnic group and gender were independent of the demographic variables on which the groups differed significantly. A positive attitude toward parental control of mate choice was associated with more opposition to interethnic mating and with more ethnic identification. The results are discussed in the context of research on the persistence and independence of cultural differences.

T1  - How to address the caveat of avoiding direct contact: Reducing prejudice towards gay and lesbian people in five Balkan countries
AN  - 2353192181
AB  - In the Balkans, contact with gays and lesbians is typically hostile or avoided. Drawing from probability samples of young people from five Balkan countries (N = 1046), we examined whether it is possible to transfer the effects of contact with other marginalized outgroups (largest ethnic minority in every country, Roma, the extremely poor and physically disabled) to acceptance of gays and lesbians (secondary outgroup), and whether this relationship could be explained by attitude generalization and increased intergroup trust. Path analyses supported the secondary transfer effect: it confirmed that, while controlling for direct contact, contact with other marginalized groups was related to more acceptance of a secondary group; this relationship was mediated by trust. This was found across all primary groups in the combined samples, while the effect varied for different groups in country samples. The results add to the value of intergroup contact as a mean of prejudice-reduction.

T1  - Is negative mass media news always associated with outgroup prejudice? The buffering role of direct contact: GPIR
AN  - 2343004646
AB  - We examined the association of the combination of direct intergroup contact and mass media news with attitudes toward immigrants and gay people in Italy, hypothesizing that direct intergroup contact would buffer the negative association between media news and attitudes, but only when contact was intimate or positive. Measuring contact variables and attitudes toward immigrants (Study 1, N = 428; Study 2, N = 426) and gay men and women (Study 3, N = 220), we found that intimate and positive direct intergroup contact was associated with more positive attitudes toward outgroup members, whereas exposure to negative news was related to more negative attitudes. Moreover, our results supported the buffering hypothesis, as the negative association between negative news and intergroup attitudes was significantly weaker amongst respondents with higher levels of intimate and positive intergroup contact.

T1  - Investigating the moderating role of intercultural factors on consumer cross-shopping behavior: Bridging the prejudice
AN  - 2398726625
AB  - The concept of prejudice has become increasingly important to scientific thinking about relations between groups. Yet, despite extensive research, little is known about how prejudice affects consumer buying behavior, especially regarding activities that involve purchasing products and services thereby crossing to suppliers from the dominant community. The purpose of this study is twofold: to examine the influence of both positive and negative prejudices on cross-shopping intention in the context of an ethnic minority-majority group relationship; and, to investigate the moderating influence of intercultural-related factors (i.e. online contact, social interaction, and acculturation) on the relationship between negative prejudice and cross-shopping intention. A sample consisting of 202 respondents was obtained from across ethnic-minority consumers (the Israeli Arabs) who routinely interact online and offline with individuals from the majority population (Israeli Jews). The conceptual framework and hypothesis are tested using the partial least squares analyzes (PLS). The study results provide a better understanding of the conflicting effects of positive and negative prejudice on cross-shopping intention. Additionally, results shed light on the moderating role of intercultural factors on the relationship between negative prejudice and cross-shopping intention. Implications are identified together with consideration of the study limitations and avenues for future research.

T1  - The role of peer, parental, and school norms in predicting adolescents’ attitudes and behaviours of majority and different minority ethnic groups in Croatia
AN  - 2335631521
AB  - Social norms in general have an important role in the regulation of intergroup relations. However, the effects of one specific type of social norms–in-group norms about intergroup contact–have not yet been extensively studied, especially among groups of different status or in different intergroup contexts. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of three types of contact norms (peer, parental and school) on four intergroup outcomes (in-group bias, social distance, tendency to discriminate, prosocial behaviour towards the outgroup) among ethnic majority and minority adolescents from four different intergroup contexts of the Republic of Croatia, as well as to test for moderating effects of age, social status and intergroup context in the strength of these effects. The research was carried out on a sample of 1440 elementary and high school students, members of Croatian majority, and Serbian, Hungarian, Czech, and Italian minority. The results indicated that although all three types of norms predict most of the intergroup outcomes, their relative importance depends on the specific type of intergroup outcome (attitudinal or behavioural), group social status (majority or minority), intergroup context (history of a recent intergroup conflict or not), and for peer norms on the age of the adolescent.

T1  - To be or not to be an inclusive teacher: Are empathy and social dominance relevant factors to positive attitudes towards inclusive education?
AN  - 2323447078
AB  - Positive inclusive teacher attitudes are a key factor in achieving inclusive education due to the many benefits they generate for schools and social contexts. Studies have focused on analysing which variables may promote positive attitudes. The objective of this study was to analyse the predictive power of sociodemographic variables, empathy (cognitive and emotional), and social dominance orientation (social dominance and opposition to equality) on teachers’ attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion by comparing linear relationship models and models based on fuzzy-set comparative qualitative analysis. The sample consisted of 268 teachers of different educational levels aged between 20 and 64 years (M = 42.46, SD = 9.22), 66% of whom were women. The teachers were administered the Sentiments, Attitudes, and Concerns about Inclusive Education Revised (SACIE-R) scale, the Basic Empathy Scale (BES), and the Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scale. Two different statistical methodologies were used: traditional regression models and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) models. The results of the regression models suggest that social dominance is the main predictor of attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Social dominance is negatively related to attitudes and positively related to sentiments and concerns. Only opposition to equality and emotional empathy are related to attitudes. On the other hand, the results of the QCA models suggest that low social dominance and high cognitive and emotional empathy, as well as female sex, predict higher levels of positive attitudes, sentiments, and concerns about inclusion. Since teachers interact most with students, it is important to be aware of how their empathy and social dominance orientations influence inclusion to develop intervention programmes that seek to train teachers in these capabilities.

T1  - Does multicultural personality moderate the relationship between cross-group friendship and allophilia?
AN  - 2297095895
AB  - Contact research has well documented the beneficial effects of cross-group interactions in general, and friendship potential in particular, in promoting positive attitudes toward outgroups. Yet, most of the studies to date have mainly focused on reducing negative attitudes and prejudice. Extending emerging attempts in social and psychological research to understand positive outgroup orientations, the present study aimed to investigate the relationship between cross-group friendship and allophilia (i.e., positive outgroup attitudes) in a sample of 406 American undergraduates. The study also examined whether individual differences in multicultural personality play a moderating role in this relationship. Findings revealed that cross-group friendship was positively associated with allophilia, and that the relationship was stronger for individuals who scored low on open-mindedness and high on social initiative. The present study highlights the important role of multicultural personality in the linkage between close cross-group interactions and positive outgroup attitudes.

T1  - Positive imagined contact is actively chosen: Exploring determinants and consequences of volitional intergroup imagery in a conflict-ridden setting: GPIR
AN  - 2229907371
AB  - Past research has ascertained the benefits of involuntary, “forced” exposure to positive imagined contact. This research explored determinants and consequences of actively chosen imagined contact in a setting of entrenched intergroup conflict. In Study 1, when given an unvalenced visualisation scenario enabling participants to steer the visualisation in any direction they wanted, Turkish Cypriots visualised an intergroup interaction nondistinguishable in quality to that of those assigned to a positive scenario. In Study 2, when asked to actively choose between visualising a positive or a negative intergroup interaction, Turkish Cypriots disproportionally preferred positive over negative contact. The chosen visualisation reflected mood and valenced confirmation biases and resulted in virtuous (vs. vicious) effects on group-level outcomes. These findings shed a first light on the psychological underpinnings of volitional intergroup imagery and indicate that intergroup imagery is a safe way of engaging with the outgroup even in contexts of entrenched conflict.

T1  - Multicultural and colorblind, investigating intergroup ideologies and relevant relations in mainland China
AN  - 2245656166
AB  - During the past decades, studies of acculturation and ideology have received great attention in social psychology, especially among western countries. But few such investigations have been conducted in Asia. In this study, we measured personal and normative support of three intergroup ideologies in the context of mainland China, and explored their mediating roles between social dominance orientation and prejudice. Surveys were conducted among 158 Chinese university students in Hangzhou, China. Results of the present study showed that the dominant societal ideology among Chinese respondents was multiculturalism, rather than assimilation or colorblindness. Moreover, based on the proposition that support for different ideologies was likely to have different effects in different countries, mediation model of personal support for ideologies was examined in the current context. As revealed, when the social norms were salient, personal support for multiculturalism mediated the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudice, while personal support for assimilation or colorblindness did not. The present study provided additional evidence to the previous theory, implications and suggestions were further discussed.

T1  - Associations between perceived positive and negative parental contact and adolescents’ intergroup contact experiences
AN  - 2216903226
AB  - This study investigated the association between perceived parental positive and negative contact and adolescents’ own positive and negative contact experiences and tested perspective-taking, intergroup anxiety, outgroup attitudes, and approach behavioral tendencies as potential mediators. A total of 325 7th and 8th Year Turkish students completed questionnaires in classrooms (Mage = 13.46, SD = 0.75). Structural equation models demonstrated that percieved negative parental contact was directly and strongly associated with negative, but not positive, adolescent contact, whereas parental positive contact had a direct positive association with adolescent positive contact. We further found that perceived parental positive contact was related to higher perspective-taking and lower intergroup anxiety which promoted approach behavioral tendencies which was, in turn, related to more positive and less negative contact among adolescents. The study highlights the critical function of parental positive and negative contact on the formation of adolescents’ contact behaviors.

T1  - Social dominance orientation and stereotype influence perception of social distance between classes
AN  - 2230835141
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China.

T1  - Police Bias, Social Identity, and Minority Groups: A Social Psychological Understanding of Cooperation with Police
AN  - 2112708544
AB  - The present study uses Social Identity Theory as a framework to investigate the collective effects of perceived police bias, ethnicity and self-identification with different groups on respondents' intentions to cooperate with police in general crime control efforts and in counter-terrorism policing. Drawing on survey data collected from 1,272 individuals from three ethnic minority backgrounds in Australia, the present study reports findings including: (1) significant and large direct positive associations between superordinate identity and willingness to cooperate with police, (2) small-to-moderate significant associations between perceived police bias and cooperation with police (positive for Vietnamese subsample; negative for Indian and Arab subsamples), and (3) significant interaction patterns between subordinate identity, perceived police bias, and ethnicity. Findings are discussed with respect to community-engaged prevention and prejudice reduction.

T1  - Positive and negative intergroup contact: Interaction not asymmetry
AN  - 2110254345
AB  - This research reports a novel investigation into the comparative effects of positive and negative direct and extended intergroup contact on intergroup orientations. It tested the generality of the positive–negative asymmetry effect among majority (N = 357) and minority (N = 101) group members in Iceland. Little evidence of asymmetry was observed: the beneficial effects of positive contact were mostly as strong as the detrimental effects of negative contact, for both direct and extended contact. However, evidence was found for alternative interaction models in which positive contact buffers the negative effects of negative contact, and negative contact enhances the benefits of positive contact. These interaction effects were found only for direct contact and principally in the majority group, but were also found for the minority group, though more weakly. No interaction was observed for extended contact. It appeared that differential group salience elicited by positive and negative contact could partly contribute to the explanation of the observed effects, at least in the majority sample.

T1  - Collective victimhood beliefs among majority and minority groups: Links to ingroup and outgroup attitudes and attribution of responsibility for conflict
AN  - 2132684057
AB  - We examined perceived ingroup and outgroup victimhood beliefs across group status and how these were uniquely associated with ingroup and outgroup attitudes and attribution of responsibility among majority (Turkish, N = 141) and minority (Kurdish, N = 86) group members in Turkey. We further explored whether the extent to which collective victimhood beliefs were shared via ingroup and outgroup members predicted our dependent measures beyond the subjective perception of ingroup victimhood. Findings showed that both groups perceived higher ingroup victimhood compared to outgroup victimhood and this difference was more pronounced among the minority group. Perceived outgroup victimhood beliefs, compared to ingroup victimhood beliefs, were more closely related to intergroup outcomes, and led to more positive outgroup and more negative ingroup outcomes. Both groups shared collective victimhood beliefs more with their ingroup friends than their outgroup friends and ingroup sharing of collective victimhood was a stronger predictor of intergroup outcomes, relating to more positive ingroup and more negative outgroup outcomes. Outgroup sharing of collective victimhood was related to more positive outgroup attitudes and lower ingroup responsibility among the Turkish group, whereas it was not related to outgroup attitudes and negatively related to ingroup attribution of responsibility among the Kurdish group. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings were discussed.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect among children: The role of social dominance orientation and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2064683830
AB  - Research has provided evidence that the effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction are not limited to the outgroup one has contact with (primary outgroup). Rather, they extend to secondary outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation (secondary transfer effect; Pettigrew, 2009, Social Psychology, 40, 55). We aimed to provide the first empirical evidence for the emergence of the secondary transfer effect among children. Majority (Italian) and minority (with an immigrant background) elementary schoolchildren were administered a questionnaire including measures of contact with the primary outgroup (minority children for the majority, majority children for the minority), prejudice towards the primary outgroup and towards a dissimilar secondary outgroup (disabled children), and social dominance orientation. Results revealed that among the majority group, contact with the primary outgroup had indirect associations with reduced prejudice towards the secondary outgroup. Specifically, we found evidence for sequential mediation by social dominance orientation and prejudice towards the primary outgroup. No secondary transfer effects emerged among minority group members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings, arguing for the importance of identifying the core processes driving the secondary transfer effect.

T1  - The role of national identity, religious identity, and intergroup contact on social distance across multiple social divides in Turkey
AN  - 2098784177
AB  - Using a nationally representative dataset from Turkey, we examined the effects of national identity, religious identity, religious practice, and intergroup contact on social distance towards disliked groups along ethnic (Turks vs. Kurds), religious (Sunnis vs. Alevis) and ideological divides (supporters vs. opponents of the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine two mechanisms (via perceived threat and empathy) through which ingroup identification and intergroup contact influence social distance toward disliked groups. Perceived threat, but not empathy, mediated the effect of national identification on higher social distance towards Kurds, AKP supporters and AKP opponents. Both perceived threat and empathy mediated the effects of religious practice on distance towards Alevis. Intergroup contact had both direct and indirect effects (via threat and empathy) on social distance. Multigroup SEM showed that contact’s effects did not vary across outgroup targets. By contrast, the effects of national and religious identity on social distance varied depending on the outgroup target. The findings highlight the importance of considering identity content and meaning attached to social categories in making predictions about the influence of identification with different social categories.

T1  - The experience of ethnic prejudice of Turkish ethnic minorities in Flanders: Does it affect parental preferences about partner selection?
AN  - 2098784061
AB  - The aim of the present study is twofold. First, we evaluate to what extent Turkish ethnic minority members experience ethnic prejudice in the Flemish society. Experiencing ethnic prejudice could affect the orientation of minority members towards the majority group, their own (migrant) community and towards the country of origin (of their parents). Therefore, in the second part we assess the effect ethnic prejudice has on a specific type of interethnic social contact: partner selection. To what extent Turkish parents prefer a Turkish partner (living in Turkey) for their children, or do they show openness towards Belgian partners? We apply linear and multinomial logistic regression models on data retrieved form a representative survey in the Turkish ethnic minority in Flanders (n = 430). First, we find that ethnic prejudice is very common in the lives of Turkish minorities in Flanders. Men, respondents with a lower socioeconomic status, and partner migrants are especially at risk of experiencing prejudice. Second, we conclude that although the majority of the parents prefers ethnically homogeneous partnerships, openness towards mixed is found among more than 25% of the parents. Experiencing ethnic prejudice and having a lower educational attainment lowers that likelihood of being open towards mixed partnerships with Belgian partners.

T1  - The End of the Dichotomy: The Effect of Social Proximity to Prototype and Periphery Group Members on Political Attitudes*
AN  - 2038325173
AB  - ObjectiveWe extend prototype theory to explain why nonmembers who are socially connected to group members hold political attitudes that differ from nonmembers lacking that connection. We anticipate that the intensity of nonmember attitudes varies by connection to a prototype or periphery group member.MethodsUsing data from the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), we model group‐salient political attitudes for veterans, union members, and their family members.ResultsWe find social distance from group members is theoretically linked to within‐group variation that distinguishes prototype from periphery group members.ConclusionAnalysis of political attitudes is enhanced beyond the traditional member/nonmember dichotomy by accounting for nonmembers’ social distance from group members.

T1  - Exploring How National Politics Influences the Outcome of Intergroup Contact among Muslim Minority Members
AN  - 2025521481
AB  - This article adds to the existing research in intergroup contact among ethnic minority members by hypothesizing that national political debate has the capacity to enhance the positive outcomes of cross‐group interaction. Analyses show that the capacity of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice toward majority members is disproportionately stronger among Muslims than among non‐Muslim minority members. Specifically, at the time of data collection, the two categories—Muslims and majority members—were highly salient in the public debate, whereas the non‐Muslim minority member category was not primed as a contrast to the majority culture. The political debate most likely stimulated Muslims to generalize their positive contact experiences to the entire majority group. The analysis contributes to the theoretical refinement of the so‐called categorization model by focusing on politically induced reactions among contacted ethnic minority members toward majority members. The analysis utilizes a tailor‐made national sample (fielded during the Mohammad Cartoon Crisis in 2006) among ethnic minority members in Denmark (N = 3,272).

T1  - Does social identity matter in individual alienation? Household-level evidence in post-reform India
AN  - 2054185204
AB  - Does consumption distance as a measure of individual alienation reveal the effect of social identity? Using the central idea of Akerlof’s ‘social distance’ theory, individual distance is calculated from their own group mean consumption and then we examine whether individuals from different social groups – caste and religion – are alienated across the distance distribution. Using India’s household-level microdata on consumption expenditure covering three major survey rounds since the inception of the reform period, we find a non-unique pattern where the marginalised and minority group households tend to be alienated across the distance distribution. However, among them, the households with higher educational attainment become more integrated as reflected in the interaction effect of education. These results are robust even after controlling for the endogeneity of education. Given this significant group difference in consumption, we undertake a group-level comparison by creating a counterfactual group through exchanging the characteristics of the privileged group to the marginalised group (or Hindus to non-Hindus), and find that the privileged group still consumes more than the counterfactual marginalised group, explaining around 77% of the estimated average consumption gap at the median quantile in 2011–12 (or 59% for Hindus versus Non-Hindus). This suggests other inherent identity-specific social factors as possible contributors to within-group alienation (relative to a better-off category) that can only be minimised through promoting education for the marginalised (or minority religion) group.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity, Inter-group Attitudes and Countervailing Pathways of Positive and Negative Inter-group Contact: An Analysis Across Workplaces and Neighbourhoods
AN  - 2015451561
AB  - This study advances the current literature investigating the relationship between contextual out-group exposure, inter-group attitudes and the role of inter-group contact. Firstly, it introduces the concept of contact-valence into this relationship; that is, whether contact is experienced positively or negatively. Secondly, it presents a comparative analysis of how processes of out-group exposure and frequency of (valenced) contact affect prejudice across both neighbourhoods and workplaces. Applying path analysis modelling to a nationally-representative sample of white British individuals in England, we demonstrate, across both contexts, that increasing out-group exposure is associated with higher rates of both positively- and negatively-valenced contact. This results in exposure exhibiting both positive and negative indirect associations with prejudice via more frequent inter-group mixing. These countervailing contact-pathways help explain how out-group exposure is associated with inter-group attitudes. In neighbourhoods, increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive-contact suppress an otherwise negative effect of neighbourhood diversity (driven partly by increasing numbers of individuals reporting negative contact). Across workplaces the effect differs such that increasing numbers of individuals experiencing negative-contact suppress an otherwise positive effect of workplace diversity (driven largely by increasing numbers of individuals experiencing positive contact).

T1  - Conducive Characteristics or Anti-Racist Context? Decomposing the Reasons for Veterans’ High Likelihood of Interracial Marriage
AN  - 1979877909
AB  - Over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, veterans have been more likely to enter into race/ethnic intermarriages than non-veterans. Theories of race/ethnic intermarriage variously point to how minority race/ethnicity, race/ethnically diverse social settings, progressive racial attitudes, and high socioeconomic status increase individuals’ likelihood of intermarrying. Veterans’ unique racial and socioeconomic characteristics may contribute to their greater likelihood of intermarrying relative to non-veterans: larger percentages of veterans than non-veterans are members of racial and ethnic minority groups, while military service increases individual service members’ long-term economic and educational prospects. At the same time, veterans share in common their exposure to the unique military environment, which may increase their likelihood of intermarriage by diversifying their social circles, and subjecting their attitudes and behavior to group norms that are more explicitly egalitarian than those of society at large. The present study considers these two possible explanations for veterans’ greater likelihood of intermarriage. We use data on seven cohorts of men over six decades in the Current Population Survey, representing a total of 1,456,742 observations, to decompose the difference in likelihood of racial intermarriage between veterans and non-veterans among married men aged 18–65. We find that across cohorts and decades, veterans’ greater likelihood of intermarrying is not fully explained by their race/ethnic and socioeconomic composition. We argue that veterans’ greater likelihood of intermarrying may therefore be driven by their exposure to the military environment.

T1  - And What About Siblings? A Longitudinal Analysis of Sibling Effects on Youth’s Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1993516063
AB  - Within the process of political socialization, the family is of particular importance. Apart from parents, however, little is known about the role of other close family members. The present study examined if siblings affect each other’s intergroup attitudes (i.e., intolerance towards immigrants, social dominance orientation). Drawing on a sample of 362 sibling dyads (older siblings: Mage = 17.77, 53.6% female; younger siblings: Mage = 13.61, 61.3% female), the results showed that older siblings’ intergroup attitudes predicted younger siblings’ attitudes, but this effect was moderated by gender. Specifically, older siblings’ intolerance and social dominance orientation were only found to affect their younger sisters, yet not their younger brothers. Although younger siblings’ intergroup attitudes had no main effect on older siblings, a significant moderation by age indicated that younger siblings affected older siblings’ social dominance orientation with increasing age. These moderation effects of age and gender were not mediated by the quality of family relationships. The findings also remained the same when parental intergroup attitudes were taken into account. While siblings were generally identified as an important agent of political socialization in youth, the results also highlight the necessity to further examine the mechanism that either facilitate or hinder sibling effects.

T1  - "Celebrity 2.0 and beyond!" Effects of Facebook profile sources on social networking advertising
AN  - 1984837039
AB  - Two experiments examined the effects of different sources (celebrity versus peer consumer) of celebrity-brand-related user-generated content (UGC) embedded in a social networking site (SNS). Consistent with the basic premises of warranting theory (stronger effects of other-endorsement than self-endorsement) and social identity theory (more positive effects of ingroup than outgroup), Experiment 1 demonstrated more positive effects of celebrity brand endorsements posted on a peer consumer's (other; in-group identity) Facebook profile page on source credibility perception and parasocial interaction with the celebrity than celebrity brand endorsements posted on the celebrity's own (self; out-group identity) Facebook profile page. Social identification mediated the effects of the Facebook profile source on parasocial interaction with the celebrity. Experiment 2 indicated that a movie star's Facebook presence contributed to a more positive attitude toward the celebrity. A peer Facebook user's movie endorsement UGC resulted in greater advertising believability, more positive attitude toward, and more positive emotional reactions toward system-generated content (SGC) sponsored Facebook advertising than the movie star's self-promotion on his own Facebook page. In addition, movie involvement moderated the relationship between the Facebook profile source and advertising effectiveness.

T1  - Out‐group peer involvement in youth alcohol consumption
AN  - 1989861714
AB  - Recent studies of alcohol consumption among students have consistently linked in‐group influence with excessive drinking. Concurrently, these studies have largely overlooked the influence of non‐alcohol‐consuming peers (the out‐group) on the in‐group's decisions to consume alcohol. However, out‐groups can have a significant impact on in‐group members' decisions regarding publicly consumed products (White, Simpson, & Argo, ), such as is the case of alcohol. In light of this, our study aims to explore how in‐group members' views of their consumption of alcohol are influenced by their out‐group. This study uses Social Identity Theory as the theoretical lens to explain consumer interaction with the out‐group (abstainers) and subsequent views of in‐group members (alcohol consumers). A social constructivist approach is adopted to enable this exploration of meaning, with concomitant use of the qualitative narrative methodology. A sample of 18 postgraduate students studying in the UK was selected. Narratives were collected and analysed using thematic analysis. Although the widely accepted view is that people tend to avoid products or behaviours that are linked with an out‐group, this paper demonstrates conditions in which alcohol consumers appreciate the out‐group. Furthermore, it reveals how drinkers' interaction with their out‐group can lead to negative attitudes towards their in‐group and their own consumption of alcohol. Based on their views of out‐groups, we propose a categorisation of alcohol consumers into 3 groups: avoiders, open admirers, and covert admirers. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications for social marketers and policy makers.

T1  - Despite Increased Insurance Coverage, Nonwhite Sexual Minorities Still Experience Disparities In Access To Care
AN  - 1952352722
AB  - Previous studies suggest that members of sexual minority groups have poorer access to health services than heterosexuals. However, few studies have examined how sexual orientation interacts with gender and race to affect health care experience. Moreover, little is known about the role in health care disparities played by economic strains such as unemployment and poverty, which may result from prejudice and discrimination based on sexual orientation. Using data for 2013-15 from the National Health Interview Survey, we found that most members of sexual minority groups no longer have higher uninsurance rates than heterosexuals, but many continue to experience poorer access to high-quality care. Gay nonwhite men, bisexual white women, and bisexual and lesbian nonwhite women are disadvantaged in multiple aspects of access, compared to straight white men. Only some of these disparities are attributable to economic factors, which implies that noneconomic barriers to care are substantial. Our results suggest that the intersection of multiple social identities can reveal important gaps in health care experience. Making culturally sensitive services available may be key to closing the gaps.

T1  - Solidarity through shared disadvantage: Highlighting shared experiences of discrimination improves relations between stigmatized groups
AN  - 1949634321
AB  - Intergroup relations research has largely focused on relations between members of dominant groups and members of disadvantaged groups. The small body of work examining intraminority intergroup relations, or relations between members of different disadvantaged groups, reveals that salient experiences of ingroup discrimination promote positive relations between groups that share a dimension of identity (e.g., 2 different racial minority groups) and negative relations between groups that do not share a dimension of identity (e.g., a racial minority group and a sexual minority group). In the present work, we propose that shared experiences of discrimination between groups that do not share an identity dimension can be used as a lever to facilitate positive intraminority intergroup relations. Five experiments examining relations among 4 different disadvantaged groups supported this hypothesis. Both blatant (Experiments 1 and 3) and subtle (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) connections to shared experiences of discrimination, or inducing a similarity-seeking mindset in the context of discrimination faced by one's ingroup (Experiment 5), increased support for policies benefiting the outgroup (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and reduced intergroup bias (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that highlighting shared experiences of discrimination can improve intergroup outcomes between stigmatized groups across dimensions of social identity. Implications of these findings for intraminority intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Stereotype content and social distancing from employees with mental illness: The moderating roles of gender and social dominance orientation
AN  - 1935881779
AB  - Mental illness is increasingly prevalent among employees, but little is known about how these individuals are perceived at work. Using the stereotype content model as a framework, we investigated warmth and competence stereotypes associated with employees with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Employees with these disorders were perceived to be low in warmth and competence, and stereotypes about individuals with anxiety were relatively more positive than those with depression or bipolar. This study also proposed and tested the extent to which stereotypes predicted work-related social distancing intentions. We found that two characteristics moderated this relationship: gender and social dominance orientation. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as they pertain to improving the experiences and well-being of employees with mental illness.

T1  - Is ethnic prejudice declining in Britain? Change in social distance attitudes among ethnic majority and minority Britons
AN  - 1934916221
AB  - Most literature on racial prejudice deals with the racial attitudes of the ethnic majority and ethnic minorities separately. This paper breaks this tradition. We examine the social distance attitudes of white and non-white British residents to test if these attitudes follow the same trends over time, whether they are driven by the same social processes and whether they are inter-related. We have three main findings. Firstly, social distance from other ethnic groups has declined over time for both white and ethnic minority Britons. For the white majority there are both period and cohort elements to this decline. Secondly, we see some evidence that social distance between the majority and minority groups is reciprocal. Specifically, minorities who experience rejection by the white British feel a greater sense of distance from them. Thirdly, we find that all groups share the perception of the same ethnic hierarchy. We see evidence of particularly widespread hostility towards Muslim Britons from all ethnic groups suggesting that Muslims are singled out for negative attention from many British residents of all other backgrounds, including a large number who do not express hostility to other groups.

T1  - Intergroup Contact as a Predictor of Violent and Nonviolent Collective Action: Evidence From Syrian Refugees and Lebanese Nationals
AN  - 1961008037
AB  - Recent research has shown that positive intergroup contact can undermine social change efforts among disadvantaged group members. We extend past this finding by investigating how frequent positive contact relates to both violent and nonviolent collective action, among both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, over and above outgroup attitudes. We examined these links in a survey of Lebanese nationals (advantaged group) and Syrian refugees (disadvantaged group) in the context of a severe economic crisis affecting both groups. We replicated previous research showing that contact predicts outgroup attitudes positively and more strongly among advantaged than among disadvantaged group members. Of importance, we also found evidence suggesting that the relationship between positive contact and collective action may depend on group status and on collective action type. Frequent positive contact reduced nonviolent collective action tendencies among disadvantaged group members but not among advantaged group members. However, more positive frequent contact was linked to lower violence support among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members. These results help shed new light on the potential benefits and limits of intergroup contact as a social change tool. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07260-001]

T1  - The role of multicultural and colorblind ideologies and typicality in imagined contact interventions
AN  - 2006795414
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that simply imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member reduces prejudice, especially if the outgroup member is typical of the whole outgroup. In this research, we tested how a multicultural vs. colorblind mindset might impact the efficacy of imagined contact with a typical or atypical outgroup member. Specifically, we tested the interactive effects between ideologies (multiculturalism vs. colorblindness) and the typicality of the outgroup member (typical vs. atypical) in the imagined encounter. Results revealed that participants exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an encounter with an atypical outgroup member expressed fewer positive perceptions (warmth and competence) toward both primary and secondary outgroups compared with respondents exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an interaction with a typical outgroup member, and compared with respondents exposed to a colorblind ideology (irrespective of typicality of the outgroup member). The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between cultural ideologies and typicality during intergroup contact when designing interventions aimed at promoting positive intergroup perceptions.

T1  - Imagined contact encourages prosocial behavior towards outgroup members: GPIR
AN  - 1912612586
AB  - Imagined contact is a relatively new technique designed to focus the accumulated knowledge of over 500 studies of intergroup contact into a simple and versatile prejudice-reduction intervention. While it is now clear that imagined contact can improve intergroup attitudes, its ability to change actual intergroup behavior is less well established. Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner's dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices. In the third study we show that this effect is mediated by increased trust towards the outgroup member. The findings demonstrate that imagined contact interventions can have a tangible impact on volitional intergroup behaviors.

T1  - Inducing similarities and differences in imagined contact: A mutual intergroup differentiation approach: GPIR
AN  - 1912608992
AB  - To enhance the prejudice-reducing effects of imagined contact we investigated a novel form of imagined contact ("balanced similarity") which emphasized both similarities and differences between the ingroup(er) and the outgroup(er). Experiment 1 compared balanced similarity with conditions inducing only differences or only similarities. "Balanced similarity" led to more positive outgroup attitudes; its differences with the "high similarity" condition were mediated by reduced distinctiveness threat, whereas its differences with the "low" similarity condition were mediated by higher perceived intergroup similarity. Experiment 2 compared the "balanced similarity" imagined contact scenario with the "standard" (positive) imagined contact scenario (Crisp, Stathi, Turner, & Husnu, 2008), and found that both conditions promoted equally favourable attitudes that were significantly more positive than in the control condition. However, only the "balanced similarity" imagined contact condition differed from the control condition on intergroup anxiety and contact self-efficacy. The "balanced similarity" condition also had an indirect effect (via self-efficacy) on positive action tendencies towards the outgroup. We discuss the utility of "balanced similarity" imagined contact, especially where contact is limited and conflict is present.

T1  - Janus-faced nature of colorblindness: Social dominance orientation moderates the relationship between colorblindness and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1929388540
AB  - Colorblindness is a popular diversity ideology promoted as a means to intergroup harmony in ethnically diverse nations. While some research suggests that colorblindness reduces intergroup bias, other work suggests that colorblindness may increase it. The present research utilizes a national sample of European New Zealanders to examine whether the relationship between colorblind endorsement and outgroup attitudes is moderated by perceivers' individual differences in social dominance orientation (SDO). Data revealed that for participants low in SDO, colorblind beliefs predicted more negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities. However, for those high in SDO, colorblind beliefs predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities. Taken together, these findings suggest that colorblindness is not all good or bad for intergroup relations--instead, its effects may depend on perceivers' own egalitarian sentiments.

T1  - Religious Perspectives on the Impact of Race on Health and Social Behaviors across the Life Course: An Introduction to a Special Issue
AN  - 1899818570
AB  - Religious involvement, affiliations, and movements have had enduring and complex associations with issues of race and social problems in the USA. Principles of religious freedom and personal liberty, originally established in opposition to religious intolerance, have given rise to astounding diversity in institutional and personal religious expression. Ironically, that same religious diversity has also incited a long and unfortunate history of religious intolerance and discrimination against religious minority groups, many of whose adherents are members of racial and cultural minorities in the USA. Religion and, specifically, religious institutions have an important and significant history of providing safe and nurturing communities for their members and improving the personal, social, and material circumstances of racial and ethnic minority groups. Strategies and mechanisms range from the individual to organizational efforts and include the inculcation of religious beliefs and values, promotion of behaviors and practices in coping with adversity, and promoting advocacy and direct action for social change. This tradition of community organizing, support, and improvement is evident in African American religious traditions and represented by a variety of civic, educational, political mobilization, and health initiatives. The efforts of innumerable religious communities that serve domestic and global migrants to the USA (i.e., immigrant churches) similarly reflect the social mission of addressing the social problems affecting their communities, as well as a mandate to serve as a cultural repository and cultural broker for their members. Finally, religious institutions have been instrumental in shaping multi-faith religious coalitions to actively confront religious prejudice, discrimination, and social marginalization and exclusion, as well as to push for change in domestic and global social policies and US military and diplomatic actions. Religion and religious institutions have thus been viewed in two very dissimilar ways—as social problems themselves (marginalization of religious minorities), as well as a remedy for the social discrimination and prejudice affecting their communities. The articles presented in this volume explore this second perspective on religious communities examining the various ways that they respond to the needs of their members with respect to providing supports, resources, and personnel to better their social circumstances. Nonetheless, it should be apparent that the expression and response of religious communities to the circumstances described in these studies arise out of the broader social context and the continued problematic position of race and religion in the USA. This article is an introduction to the second special issue on race and religion appearing in Race and Social Problems. The first special issue, published in the March 2017, addressed a variety of topics related to religion including the correlations of religious participation (Bowie et al.2017), religion in relation to migration (Pendergrass 2017) and immigration policies (Brown and Brown 2017), religion and the psychological construct of optimism (Mattis et al. 2017), the associations between religion, discrimination and drinking behaviors (Henderson 2017), religion and depression (Mouzon 2017), and instrumental social support exchanges (e.g., transportation, financial assistance) among African American church members (Taylor et al. 2017). This second special issue of Race and Social Problems also addresses several important topics regarding the role of religion in the lives of Americans. The following section highlights the research studies presented in this special issue.

T1  - BEHAVIOURAL INTENTION AND PERCEPTION OF ETHNIC GROUPS AMONG NATIONAL YOUTH SERVICE CORP MEMBERS IN NIGERIA
AN  - 1926455573
AB  - Nigeria like many other African countries is an arbitrary manmade national entity amalgamated from numerous ethnic groups. Stereotypic belief proliferates as the number of these ethnic groups. This study therefore examines if stereotype is used in intra ethnic perception and inters ethnic perception; and measures the behavioral intention towards intra ethnic social distance and inters ethnic social distance. 78 (50%) male and 78 (50%) female members of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) from Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba ethnic groups were purposively selected as participants. The participants have non-competitive common goal and equality of demographics such age range of 22-30 years, educational status and income. Standardised ethnic perception rating scale and social distance scale were utilized and data collected were analysed using t-test for independent groups. The findings show that the participants did not use stereotype in intra ethnic perception and inter ethnic perception. However, there is significant difference in intra ethnic social distance and inter ethnic social distance. Inter ethnic social distance is higher than intra ethnic social distance. Implication for behavioural intention and willingness to interact with other ethnic groups in different social relations is discussed in line with intergroup contact as it extends to Africa.

T1  - Shifting racial hierarchies: An analysis of residential segregation among multi-racial and mono-racial groups in the United States
AN  - 1870000805
AB  - Multi-racial (mixed-race) people constitute a growing percentage of the United States (US) population. The study reported in this paper used residential segregation measures as a proxy for social distance, to examine whether segregation levels of multi-racial groups differ from those of mono-racial groups in the US in 2010. First, we find that all multi-racial groups considered in the study experience lower levels of segregation at county level than their mono-racial counterparts. However, black-whites and Hispanic-whites experience higher levels of segregation than other multi-racial groups. Second, we find region and minority composition of counties are associated significantly with segregation levels for multi-racial groups, but relative income is not.

T1  - Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Intergroup Contact: Descriptions and Mediators of Positive and Negative Contact Among Majority and Minority Groups
AN  - 1869634286
AB  - Positive contact predicts reduced prejudice, but negative contact may increase prejudice at a stronger rate. The current project builds on this work in four ways: establishing an understanding of contact that is grounded in subjective experience, examining the affective mediators involved in the negative contact-prejudice relationship, extending research on the effects of positive and negative contact to minority groups, and examining the contact asymmetry experimentally. Study 1 introduced anger as a mediator of the relationships between positive and negative contact and prejudice among White Americans (N = 371), using a contact measure that reflected the frequency and intensity of a wide range of experiences. Study 2 found a contact asymmetry among Black and Hispanic Americans (N = 365). Study 3 found initial experimental evidence of a contact asymmetry (N = 309). We conclude by calling for a more nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that recognizes its multifaceted and subjective nature.

T1  - Online political participation, online contacts with out-groups members and social distances
AN  - 1920414158
AB  - In light of the growing role of social media in conflict management, the current study analyzes the interrelationship of online political participation of Israeli Jews, the frequency of their online contacts with Arabs, and Jews' perceived social distances from Arabs. The research was conducted through an online survey of a representative sample of 458 Israeli Jews who use the social media at least 3 times a week. Overall, although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, results suggest that frequency of online contacts may positively affect closeness to Arabs in line with contact theory. In keeping with the socialization perspective of political engagement, the findings indicate that the impact of online political participation on social distances from Arabs was mediated by interactions between Jews and Arabs in the social media.

T1  - Valuing diversity in Spain and Canada: The role of multicultural ideology in intergroup attitudes and intentions to reduce inequalities
AN  - 1878076691
AB  - Multicultural ideology proposes that group memberships should be not just acknowledged but also valued in order to accommodate diversity and attain equality. In three studies conducted in Spain and Canada we analyzed, using different measures, the relationship between multicultural ideology on the one hand and prejudice, support for social policies, and motivation for social change on the other hand. In Spain we focused on responses to Gitanos (Spanish Roma) and, in Canada, on First Nations people. Results showed that multicultural ideology was related in both cases to lower prejudice and higher support for social policies to support the minority group and motivation for social change. The internal motivation to control prejudice was an important mediator of this relationship in both countries. In contrast, the way in which social identities are represented played a different role as a function of country: whereas a dual identity representation played a mediating role in Canada, a common identity representation was the mediator in Spain. These results support the importance of valuing cultural diversity to harmonize intergroup relations and to reduce inequalities between majorities and minority groups.

T1  - Living together in multi-ethnic cities: People of migrant background, their interethnic friendships and the neighbourhood
AN  - 1854783733
AB  - This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come together in everyday life in Europe. Instead of looking at overall 'perceptions' and 'stances', which are context-dependent and mediated through political-ideological currents and discourses as well as broader patterns of prejudice, we focus on sustained close contacts that suggest meaningful and organic relationships. Since it is most often people of migrant background who are blamed for leading 'parallel lives' and 'not integrating', we chose to focus on them and their interethnic friendships. Moreover, we seek to understand the relevance and role of the neighbourhood context in the development of those relationships. Despite the expressive fears in public discourses about the supposed negative impact of the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities on social cohesion, our findings indicate that close interethnic relationships are not uncommon in diverse European cities. They further highlight that the neighbourhood context plays an important role in the first years of migrants' settlement. Relationships in the neighbourhood develop in less formal social settings and are also less demanding in terms of host-country cultural skills on the part of the migrants, thus giving the opportunity to newcomers to develop close interethnic relationships with natives. Finally, the analysis supports the positive role of diversity at the neighbourhood level in the development of interethnic friendships and stresses the importance of the neighbourhood's socio-spatial characteristics and its location in the wider urban net.

T1  - Predicting support for collective action in the conflict between Turks and Kurds: Perceived threats as a mediator of intergroup contact and social identity: GPIR
AN  - 1830218141
AB  - Two studies investigated the role of perceived realistic and symbolic threats in predicting collective action tendencies, and in mediating effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action in the context of an intractable conflict. Extending earlier research on collective action, integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding collective action and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of collective action can help to explain collective action tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts.

T1  - Effects of diversity versus segregation on automatic approach and avoidance behavior towards own and other ethnic groups
AN  - 1844847934
AB  - We present the results of a study in which we measured automatic intergroup behavior and evaluations in ethnic majority and minority group members. We focus our attention on the level of segregation and diversity of immediate life contexts as indicators of outgroup exposure. Specifically, Dutch ethnic minority and majority students enrolled at ethnically segregated and diverse schools completed a measure of automatic approach and avoidance behavior and reported explicit intergroup attitudes. The research is framed into prevailing theories in the field: Social Identity Theory and System Justification Theory. Results of our study suggest that segregation of minority group members' immediate life context may be an important moderator of evaluations as well as approach and avoidance behavior toward ingroup and outgroup. In particular, minority members in segregated schools showed an approach bias towards their ingroup, whereas minority members in diverse schools showed an approach bias towards the majority outgroup.

T1  - What Lies Beneath? Minority Group Members' Suspicion of Whites' Egalitarian Motivation Predicts Responses to Whites' Smiles
AN  - 1837635086
AB  - Antiprejudice norms and attempts to conceal racial bias have made Whites' positive treatment of racial minorities attributionally ambiguous. Although some minorities believe Whites' positivity is genuine, others are suspicious of Whites' motives and believe their kindness is primarily motivated by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced. For those suspicious of Whites' motives, Whites' smiles may paradoxically function as threat cues. To the extent that Whites' smiles cue threat among suspicious minorities, we hypothesized that suspicious minorities would explicitly perceive Whites' smiles as threatening (Study 1), automatically orient to smiling White--as opposed to smiling Black--targets (Study 2), and accurately discriminate between Whites' real and fake smiles (Study 3). These results provide convergent evidence that cues typically associated with acceptance and affiliation ironically function as threat cues among suspicious racial minorities.

T1  - Belief in Race as Biological: Early Life Influences, Intergroup Outcomes, and the Process of "Unlearning"
AN  - 1816297590
AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

T1  - Social Groups Prioritize Selective Attention to Faces: How Social Identity Shapes Distractor Interference
AN  - 1813899460
AB  - Human faces automatically attract visual attention and this process appears to be guided by social group memberships. In two experiments, we examined how social groups guide selective attention toward in-group and out-group faces. Black and White participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on faces (Experiment 1). White participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (Black) compared to in-group (White) distractor faces. Likewise, Black participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (White) compared to in-group (Black) distractor faces. However, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load—when the task was visually difficult. To examine the malleability of this pattern of racial bias, a separate sample of participants were assigned to mixed-race minimal groups (Experiment 2). Participants assigned to groups were less accurate on trials with their minimal in-group members compared to minimal out-group distractor faces, regardless of race. Again, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load. Taken together, these results suggest that social identity guides selective attention toward motivationally relevant social groups—shifting from out-group bias in the domain of race to in-group bias in the domain of minimal groups—when perceptual resources are scarce.

T1  - "All Lives Matter": The Cost of Colorblind Racial Attitudes in Diverse Social Networks
AN  - 1787037480
AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of colorblind racial attitudes and outgroup prejudice on people's social network positions within a diverse social setting. Sixty-four racially diverse participants created self-resembling avatars and interacted in groups of diverse peers in the virtual world, Second Life. We conducted a social network analysis based on friendships developed during the group interactions and also examined participants' physical distances in relation to outgroup members and levels of chat participation. Colorblind racial attitudes, but not outgroup prejudice, were directly related to lower levels of closeness centrality and clustering within the network. In addition, outgroup physical distance, but not chat participation, was found to be a behavioral mechanism that mediated the relationships between: 1) colorblind racial attitudes and closeness centrality; and 2) colorblind racial attitudes and clustering. Findings are discussed in relation to the adverse affects of colorblind racial attitudes on intergroup behavior and the pro-sociality of recognizing race and racism within increasingly diverse settings such as the workplace or educational settings.

T1  - Immigration as a Threat: Explaining the Changing Pattern of Xenophobia in Spain
AN  - 1865250295
AB  - Scenarios of economic crisis and rising unemployment have never been favourable to immigration. However, the desire to tighten up on immigration policy may also arise within the context of economic growth and a drop in the unemployment rate. This article aims to explain the changing pattern of xenophobia and immigration policy in Spain. Opinion polls run in Spain from 1993 to 2012 are analysed and supplemented with survey data from Eurobarometers and qualitative materials from the MEXEES and Living Together projects and the 2011 qualitative Eurobarometer. In line with Group Conflict Theory, the economic recession accentuates the image of immigration as an economic threat, with the consequent increase in xenophobia. However, economic booms in themselves do not determine the acceptance of immigrants. Longitudinal monitoring of public opinion data corroborates the fact that both the feeling of economic threat (Group Conflict Theory) and cultural threat (Social Identity Theory) depend on the perceived presence of immigrants, along with the image and attention paid to immigration in the media and political discourse.

T1  - The effect of intergroup contact on secondary group attitudes and social dominance orientation: GPIR
AN  - 1786223913
AB  - The current study tested the extent to which intergroup contact reduces social dominance orientation (SDO), producing secondary transfer effects. Participants were first-year undergraduate students randomly assigned to live with either a same-race roommate or a roommate of a different race in university housing. Participants completed a feeling thermometer and a measure of SDO at the beginning and end of the fall semester. Participants in interracial rooms reported lower levels of SDO and more positive attitudes toward secondary groups (i.e., racial/ethnic groups other than their roommates' group) than participants in same-race rooms at the end of the semester. Those in interracial rooms exhibited a significant change in SDO levels and attitudes across time, whereas those in same-race rooms exhibited no change. Furthermore, SDO fully mediated the effect of intergroup contact on attitudes toward secondary groups. These findings provide causal evidence of secondary transfer effects and indicate SDO as an underlying mechanism. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/3/328.abstract]

T1  - Love thy neighbour? Exploring prejudice against ethnic minority groups in a divided society: the case of Northern Ireland
AN  - 1784150894
AB  - Northern Ireland has seen a rise in racially motivated crimes and incidents reported to police in recent years and, although this has been accompanied by intensified media coverage, this phenomenon has been the subject of relatively little research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically three theories that have been proposed to explain prejudice towards ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland; economic self-interest, social contact, and 'sectarianism as racism'. Using the 2013 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which contains new questions on contact with ethnic minorities, this study looks at attitudes towards Eastern Europeans, Muslims and a third category of 'other ethnic groups'. Results from multivariate linear regression provide evidence for all three theories but also show that the strength and significance of predictive variables for prejudice vary across the minority groups. The findings that there are different motivations for prejudice towards different groups can inform policies to tackle racism in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Identification and ethnic diversity underlie support for multicultural rights: A multilevel analysis in Bulgaria
AN  - 1773531784
AB  - Bulgaria is historically a multicultural society, composed of the Bulgarian (ethnic) majority and a number of ethnic minorities among which Bulgarian Turks and Roma are the largest. Both minority communities are stigmatized in contemporary Bulgaria, though to different degrees and for different reasons. Ethnic minorities' rights to preserve their culture, customs, and language are a topic of contentious debate. The purpose of this study was to examine individual- and context-level antecedents of the ethnic Bulgarian majority's support for multicultural rights of ethnic minorities. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with International Social Survey Programme ISSP 2003 data (N = 920 in 28 Bulgarian districts). At the individual-level, an ethnic conception of the nation and anti-Roma symbolic prejudice were negatively related to support for multicultural rights, whereas national identification was positively related to the support of these rights. Over and above individual-level effects, and in line with recent extensions of intergroup contact theory, the percentage of Bulgarian Turks within districts was positively related to support for multicultural rights. Importantly, support for multicultural rights was particularly high in districts characterized by ethnic diversity, that is, in districts with high proportions of both Bulgarian Turks and Roma. The beneficial effects of ethnic diversity and theoretical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Dual identity, in-group projection, and out-group feelings among ethnic minority groups
AN  - 1782204962
AB  - This study extends research on dual identity and in-group projection by considering category prototypicality and indispensability, and by focusing on ethnic minority members and their attitudes towards the native majority and minority out-groups. Among a sample of 491 participants of the three largest immigrant-origin groups in the Netherlands, it was found that the minority in-group was seen as relatively more prototypical and relatively more indispensable for the national category in comparison with minority out-groups, but not in comparison with the native majority. In support of the in-group projection model, stronger dual identity was associated with higher relative in-group prototypicality and relative in-group indispensability in comparison with the majority and, via both these relative perceptions, to a less positive attitude towards the native Dutch. In addition and in support of the common in-group identity model, dual identity was associated with more positive minority out-group feelings via higher minority out-group prototypicality and indispensability. It is concluded that dual identity can have both positive and negative consequences for intergroup relations depending on perceived (relative) prototypicality and indispensability, and depending on whether the out-group is the majority or other minorities.

T1  - Employer Attitudes, the Marginal Employer, and the Ethnic Wage Gap
AN  - 1856540447
AB  - In most EU countries, ethnic minorities have lower wages than does the ethnic majority. To what extent these wage gaps are the result of prejudice toward ethnic minority workers is virtually unknown. The authors examine the role that prejudice plays in the creation of the ethnic wage gap in one of Europe's most egalitarian countries, Sweden. The analysis takes into account the important distinction between average employer attitudes and the attitude of the marginal employer (the attitude of the most prejudiced employer hiring the ethnic minority). Results confirm that the attitudes of the marginal employer -- but not those of the average employer -- are important for explaining the ethnic wage gap.

T1  - Collective Action in Response to Microaggression: Implications for Social Well-Being
AN  - 1749602735
AB  - Discrimination towards various minority groups can now be found to have subtler manifestations. These forms can be described as microaggressions--the brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural and environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group (Sue et al. in Am Psychol 62(4):271-286, 2007 ). In order to delineate the process involved in the tendency to act in response to perceived discrimination, researchers have distinguished two distinct routes: an emotional route which explores the role of anger in response to injustice in triggering action and an efficacy route where the conviction that problems can be solved collectively motivates group members to act against discrimination (Van Zomeren et al. in J Personal Soc Psychol 87(5):649-664, 2004 ). The present research adopts and extends this model to explore how Northeasterners in Delhi respond to microaggression experiences and further what implication this has for their social well-being. Not just in Delhi, but all over the country Northeasterners face prejudice due to their looks and different lifestyle. However, the concerns of this group have not been the focus of much academic research. Two hundred and fourteen (109 females; 105 males) Northeasterners residing in Delhi for a minimum of 1 year at the time of the study in the age group of 19-31 years took part in this research. Results provide evidence for the emotional pathway. The results are discussed in the light of existing work on discrimination, collective action and social well-being as well as the unique context of Northeasterners in Delhi.

T1  - "I'd rather we be neighbours than lovers": The two-sidedness of multiculturalism: GPIR
AN  - 1933533706
AB  - Multiculturalism can be viewed as promoting positive intergroup relations in the public domain (neighbours, classmates) and heritage culture maintenance in the romantic domain (marriage). The present study examined this "two-sidedness" of multiculturalism by focusing on intergroup social distance in relation to endorsement of multiculturalism, group identifications, and group status. The study was conducted in Mauritius amongst 1,784 adolescents from the three main ethnic groups, Hindus (n = 844), Muslims (n = 630), and Creoles (n = 310). In agreement with the "two-sidedness," participants made a distinction between public and romantic social distance, and intergroup differentiation in social distance was stronger in the romantic compared to the public domain. The endorsement of multiculturalism was associated to lower out-group public distance and lower in-group romantic distance. National identification predicted lower public and romantic out-group social distance. Ethnic identification was associated with higher out-group social distances and lower in-group social distances, particularly for the high-status group of Hindus.

T1  - Collective identity factors and the attitude toward violence in defense of ethnicity or religion among Muslim youth of Turkish and Moroccan descent
AN  - 1762012635
AB  - Collective deprivation, connectedness to mainstream society (friendship and psychological closeness to majority individuals) and in-group identity factors (i.e. strength of in-group identity, and perceived in-group superiority) were investigated among Muslim Dutch youth of Turkish and Moroccan descent, in relation to their attitudes toward violence in defense of religion or ethnicity, and the willingness to use such violence. Data come from a sample of students (N = 398, age 14-18 years). Results show that perceptions of in-group superiority were predicted by higher connectedness to the in-group and lower connectedness to Dutch society in both ethnic groups and by collective relative deprivation among Moroccan-Dutch participants only. In both groups, attitudes toward violent in-group defense and violence willingness were predicted by perceptions of in-group superiority. Collective relative deprivation directly predicted more positive attitudes to violent in-group defense among Turkish-Dutch youth, as well as indirectly (via in-group superiority) among Moroccan-Dutch. Connectedness to the in-group directly predicted the willingness to use a violent in-group defense among the Turkish-Dutch participants and again indirectly (via in-group superiority) among Moroccan-Dutch participants. The results underline the relevance of collective identification processes to the attitudes of violent in-group defense among young Muslims of the second generation in a rather tensed socio-political climate. The study outcomes emphasize the importance of examining the dynamics between different Muslim groups, as their unique acculturation patterns yield particular pathways to the attitudes toward violent in-group defense and the willingness hereof.

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1767328597; 201605714
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Is Group Membership Zero-Sum? Effects of Ethnicity, Threat, and Social Identity on Dual National Identity
AN  - 1690399933
AB  - This paper presents an investigation into marginalizing racism, a form of prejudice whereby ingroup members claim that specific individuals belong to their group, but also exclude them by not granting them all of the privileges of a full ingroup member. One manifestation of this is that perceived degree of outgroup membership will covary negatively with degree of ingroup membership. That is, group membership may be treated as a zero-sum quantity (e.g., one cannot be both Australian and Iraqi). Study 1 demonstrated that judges allocate more zero-sum membership assignments and lower combined membership in their country of origin and their adopted country to high-threat migrants than low-threat migrants. Study 2 identified a subtle type of zero-sum reasoning which holds that stronger degree of membership in one’s original nationality constrains membership in a new nationality to a greater extent than stronger membership in the new nationality constrains membership in one’s original nationality. This pattern is quite general, being replicated in large samples from four nations (USA, UK, India, and China). Taken together, these studies suggest that marginalizing racism is more than a belief that people retain a “stain” from membership in their original group. Marginalizing racism also manifests itself as conditional zero-sum beliefs about multiple group memberships.

T1  - Perceptions of Discrimination as a Marker of Integration Among Muslim-Canadians: The Role of Religiosity, Ethnic Identity, and Gender
AN  - 1829550369
AB  - Although Muslim-Canadians report general satisfaction with their lives (Adams, 2009 ), there is evidence that their circumstances within Canada are less than ideal (Beyer, 2005 ; Helly, 2004 ). This study was designed to investigate perceptions of discrimination among Muslim-Canadians and to determine whether these perceptions were related to levels of religiosity, ethnic identity, and gender. The role of generational status was also explored. Seventy-seven students (ages 18 to 29) who self-identified as Muslim were recruited in Southern Ontario, Canada. Overall, participants reported moderate levels of perceived discrimination. A positive relationship between religiosity and perceptions of discrimination was found, but not between ethnic identity and perceptions of discrimination. Additionally, Muslim women perceived greater discrimination than Muslim men. Few differences between first- and second-generation Muslim-Canadians were found. The results are discussed within the literature on Muslims and minorities in North America and signify the importance of understanding Muslim experiences in Canadian society.

T1  - The devil is in the details: Abstract versus concrete construals of multiculturalism differentially impact intergroup relations
AN  - 1542000590; 201426969
AB  - Three experiments integrated several theories in psychology and sociology to identify the conditions under which multiculturalism has positive versus negative effects on majority group members' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities. On the basis of social cognitive construal theories, we predicted and found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms by highlighting its broad goals reduced White Americans' prejudice toward ethnic minorities relative to a control condition, whereas construing multiculturalism in concrete terms by highlighting specific ways in which its goals can be achieved increased White Americans' prejudice relative to the same control (Experiments 1 and 2). Using social identity threat research, we found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms decreased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity, whereas construing it in concrete terms increased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity; threat in turn fueled prejudice (Experiments 2 and 3). Perceivers' political orientation moderated the effects of multiculturalism construals on prejudicial attitudes and social distancing behavioral intentions (Experiment 3). Symbolic threat to national identity but not realistic threat to national resources mediated these effects. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate when multiculturalism leads to positive versus negative intergroup outcomes, why, and how political orientation shapes prejudice and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities.

T1  - Implicit and Explicit Illusory Correlation as a Function of Political Ideology
AN  - 1523873904
AB  - Research has demonstrated that people who embrace different ideological orientations often show differences at the level of basic cognitive processes. For instance, conservatives (vs. liberals) display an automatic selective attention for negative (vs. positive) stimuli, and tend to more easily form illusory correlations between negative information and minority groups. In the present work, we further explored this latter effect by examining whether it only involves the formation of explicit attitudes or it extends to implicit attitudes. To this end, following the typical illusory correlation paradigm, participants were presented with members of two numerically different groups (majority and minority) each performing either a positive or negative behaviour. Negative behaviors were relatively infrequent, and the proportion of positive and negative behaviors within each group was the same. Next, explicit and implicit (i.e., IAT-measured) attitudes were assessed. Results showed that conservatives (vs. liberals) displayed stronger explicit as well as implicit illusory correlations effects, forming more negative attitudes toward the minority (vs. majority) group at both the explicit and implicit level.

T1  - Interminority Attitudes: The Roles of Ethnic and National Identification, Contact, and Multiculturalism
AN  - 1531931236; 201423009
AB  - This study examined interminority attitudes among a large sample (N = 1,987) of two minority groups (of Turkish and Moroccan origin) in the Netherlands. The focus is on their attitudes toward each other, toward a third ethnic minority group, and toward the native majority group. The aim is to simultaneously test theoretical predictions related to group categorization and group identification, intergroup contacts, and endorsement of multiculturalism. More social distance was reported toward the less-similar ethnic outgroup than the more-similar Muslim one. More contact with a particular outgroup was associated with less social distance toward that outgroup. There was evidence for secondary transfer effects of contact in relation to other ethnic minority outgroups, but not in relation to the native majority group. Stronger national identification and stronger endorsement of multiculturalism were both associated with less social distance toward all ethnic outgroups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Dual Identity in Interethnic Context: An International Journal of Pure Communication Inquiry
AN  - 2088834127
AB  - The field of social psychology, over the past few years, has created a new term to describe threats to collective identity called social identity threat. This study sets out to present how social identity threat may arise between different ethnic groups, describes its conditions and determining factors, possible responses and forms of reaction to such dangers; furthermore, it also covers factors which decide what self-defense strategy one may choose. Finally, the possible outcomes and consequences are examined. The article discusses the phenomenon of social identity threat using empirics of theoretical and international research applied to the coexistence of ethnic Germans and Hungarians in a village in Hungary. Exploring the life of the settlement is part of a broader empirical research.

T1  - Changing the ideological roots of prejudice: Longitudinal effects of ethnic intergroup contact on social dominance orientation
AN  - 1512218304; 201408603
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been reported to be strongly related to a multitude of intergroup phenomena, but little is known about situational experiences that may influence SDO. Drawing from research on intergroup contact theory, we argue that positive intergroup contact is able to reduce SDO-levels. The results of an intergroup contact intervention study among high school students (Study 1, N = 71) demonstrated that SDO levels were indeed attenuated after the intervention. Furthermore, this intervention effect on SDO was especially pronounced among students reporting a higher quality of contact. A cross-lagged longitudinal survey among adults (Study 2, N = 363) extended these findings by demonstrating that positive intergroup contact is able to decrease SDO over time. Moreover, we did not obtain evidence for the idea that people high in SDO would engage less in intergroup contact. These findings indicate that intergroup contact erodes one of the important socio-ideological bases of generalized prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Urban district identity as a common ingroup identity: The different role of ingroup prototypicality for minority and majority groups
AN  - 1315600204; 201307419
AB  - In this paper, we examined how identification with urban districts as a common ingroup identity and perceived ingroup prototypicality influence the attitudes of residents toward other ethnic groups in their neighborhood. The overall conclusion of two field studies (N = 214 and N = 98) is that for majority-group members, there may be a positive relation between identification with an overarching identity and outgroup attitudes but only when they perceive their ingroup as low in prototypicality for the overarching group (Study 1 and 2). Conversely, for minority-group members, there may be a positive relation between identification and outgroup attitudes but only when they perceive their ingroup as high in prototypicality for the overarching group (Study 2). Outgroup prototypicality did not moderate the relation between identification and outgroup attitudes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Contact, evaluation and social distance: Differentiating majority and minority effects
AN  - 1417520796; 201332133
AB  - Contact research has traditionally focused on reducing negative attitudes or emotions towards outgroups. In the current studies we focus on reduced social distance as an outcome of intergroup contact -- that is a person's desire to have increased contact with members of a group -- and investigate whether outgroup evaluation in associated with these generalizing effects of contact. Drawing on data from a large sample of secondary school students in Australia gathered from majority and minority group members the findings demonstrate that having contact with an outgroup reduces social distance to the group in general. However, for majority group members, evaluation of the minority group is a strong predictor of social distance and evaluation is also improved with intergroup contact. Importantly, evaluations of the outgroup play no such role for minority group members. The findings highlight an alternate model for understanding contact effects and suggest that reduced social distance rather than improved outgroup evaluations may be more important in understanding minority responses to contact.

T1  - Measuring discrimination facing ethnic minority job applicants: an Irish experiment
AN  - 1910529566
AB  - The role of employer discrimination in labour market matching is often acknowledged but challenging to quantify. What part of the 'ethnic penalty' in the labour market is due to recruitment discrimination? This experiment, the first of its kind in Ireland, explicitly measured this by sending out nearly 500 equivalent CVs from Irish and minority candidates in response to advertised vacancies in the greater Dublin area. We find that candidates with Irish names are over twice as likely to be called to interview as are candidates with an African, Asian or German name. This discrimination rate is high by international standards, and does not vary between minority groups. We develop the discussion of the role of prejudice and stereotypes in discrimination in this article, arguing that our findings may be linked to the fact that Ireland is a 'new immigration' country, with no established minority groups and a cohesive national identity.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Evaluations of Race-Based Exclusion in Urban Minority Children and Adolescents
AN  - 867421682; 21052799
AB  - There is a dearth of published research on the role of intergroup contact on urban US ethnic minority children's and adolescents' evaluations of racial exclusion. The current investigation examined these issues in a sample of low-income minority 4th, 7th, and 10th grade (N = 129, 60% female) African American and Latino/a students attending predominately racial and ethnic minority US urban public schools. Using individual interviews, participants were presented with scenarios depicting three contexts of interracial peer exclusion (lunch at school, a sleepover party, and a school dance). Novel findings were that intergroup contact was significantly related to low-income urban ethnic minority youth's evaluations of the wrongfulness of race-based exclusion and their awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion. Further, significant interactions involving intergroup contact, context, age, and gender were also found. Findings illustrated the importance of intergroup contact for ethnic minority students and the complexity of ethnic minority children's and adolescents' judgments and decision-making about interracial peer exclusion.

T1  - Ingroup norms, intergroup contact and intergroup anxiety as predictors of the outgroup attitudes of majority and minority youth
AN  - 1417521414; 201332183
AB  - This study focused on the interplay of perceived parental and peer norms and the quality of intergroup contact in predicting outgroup attitudes among majority and minority youth. In addition, the role of intergroup anxiety on the contact-attitude association was studied simultaneously with the effects of social norms. 225 adolescents (93 Finnish majority and 132 Russian-speaking minority youth) were surveyed. As was hypothesized, the effects of intergroup contact and social norms on the outgroup attitudes were different depending on the group status: perceived norms and the quality of intergroup contact had a joint effect on outgroup attitudes only among minority youth. While perceived norms and contact experiences affected the outgroup attitudes of majority group members independently of each other, minority group members' negative contact experiences were associated with negative attitudes towards the majority only when the perceived ingroup norms supported the expression of negative attitudes. Surprisingly, intergroup anxiety mediated the contact-attitude association only in minority youth, and the effect of contact quality on outgroup attitudes was stronger among the minority than among the majority. The results are discussed in relation to the specific intergroup context in question. It is suggested that both positive ingroup norms and pleasant personal contact experiences play a crucial role in the formation of positive attitudes among minority as well as majority youth, and in some contexts positive norms may be even more important than positive intergroup contact.

T1  - When and why does extended contact work? The role of high quality direct contact and group norms in the development of positive ethnic intergroup attitudes amongst children
AN  - 902083847; 201122117
AB  - This research examines quasi-experimentally for the first time whether direct contact moderates the extended contact effect amongst children, and whether the extended contact effect is mediated by either in-group or out-group norms about cross-ethnic friendships. We tested two forms of extended contact (Dual identity and Common in-group identity) among ethnic majority children aged 6-11 years (white-English, n = 153) with differing levels of high quality (i.e., cross-ethnic friendships) or low quality (i.e., acquaintances) direct contact with the Indian-English out-group. As expected, the extended contact effect was demonstrated only amongst children who reported less high quality direct contact. Furthermore, we found the effect of extended contact was mediated by out-group norms. We also found evidence of moderated mediation, with the indirect effect of extended contact through in-group norms being significantly stronger amongst older children. The implications for extended contact theory and the future development of prejudice-reduction interventions amongst children are discussed.

T1  - Assimilation ideology and outgroup attitudes among ethnic majority members
AN  - 1018356355; 201212756
AB  - Four studies were conducted to test whether assimilation ideology affects majority group members' attitudes towards ethnic minorities. Assimilation affirms and justifies the identity of majority groups and highly-identified group members are motivated to think and behave in the ingroup's best interest. Therefore, it was expected that assimilation would make higher identifiers more negative. The first two studies focused on the individual endorsement of assimilation and the other two used an experimental design to encourage participants to think in terms of assimilation. Results in all four studies show that assimilation is related to more negative outgroup attitudes, especially for higher majority group identifiers. The findings are discussed in relation to attempts to rethink and rehabilitate assimilation theory, and to other ideologies for dealing with cultural diversity.

T1  - Longitudinal effects of contact on intergroup relations: The role of majority and minority group membership and intergroup emotions
AN  - 764417476; 201064655
AB  - A field study was conducted in the Italian context to examine the longitudinal effects of contact on improved intergroup relations, and to test whether the effects were different for majority and minority group members. Furthermore, we examined the processes underlying contact effects. Participants were 68 Italian (majority) and 31 immigrant (minority) secondary school students, who completed a questionnaire at two time points. The results of regression analyses showed that, consistent with the contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954), quantity and quality of contact longitudinally improved outgroup evaluation and increased the attribution of positive stereotypes to the outgroup; the reverse paths were non-significant. Notably, whereas quantity of contact improved intergroup attitudes and stereotypes for both majority and minority participants, quality of contact had reliable effects only for the majority group. Intergroup anxiety and empathy mediated the longitudinal effects of quantity of contact for both Italians and immigrants; the cross-lagged effects of contact quality on criterion variables for the Italian group were mediated by intergroup empathy. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Group Identification and Prejudice: Theoretical and Empirical Advances and Implications
AN  - 758121521; 201056981
AB  - This article reviews theoretical perspectives explaining the positive relationship between group identification and perceptions of prejudice. In particular, we focus on the prejudice distribution account, which contends that highly identified minorities report more frequent experiences with prejudice than weakly identified minorities, in part, because majority group members do in fact react more negatively toward highly identified minorities than they do toward the weakly identified. We describe evidence revealing that people accurately detect minority identification, even given minimal information. Further, majority group members use these inferences about identification to guide their attitudes and behaviors toward minorities. We discuss the implications of this research for theoretical perspectives on within-category approaches to the study of prejudice. We also discuss practical implications and offer suggestions for addressing this type of prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How should intergroup contact be structured to reduce bias among majority and minority group children?
AN  - 754037282; 201049570
AB  - This experiment examined the effectiveness of one-group and dual-identity recategorization strategies on reducing intergroup bias among 180 European Portuguese and African Portuguese 9- and 10-year-old children. Results revealed that each of these recategorization strategies, relative to one that emphasized separate group identities, was successful in producing positive attitudes toward the outgroup children present during the session, the outgroup as a whole, and the outgroup as a whole three weeks later. Consistent with a functional perspective regarding which representation would most effectively promote their group's goals, a dual identity was more effective for the European Portuguese majority group, whereas a one-group identity was more effective for the African Portuguese minority group. Additional analyses explored a model of the process of generalization that formally links attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole to the attitudes toward outgroup members present during contact.

T1  - Intermarriage Attitude among Ethnic Minority and Majority Groups in the Netherlands: The Role of Family Relations and Immigrant Characteristics1
AN  - 651966542
AB  - Using a Dutch national sample containing 7,158 respondents, we examined to what extent 1 ) ethnic background, 2) family characteristics and 3) migrant characteristics are related to ethnic distance, expressed through the intermarriage attitude, of the Dutch majority and four migrant groups: Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans. First, our study showed that large differences in ethnic distance exist between the five ethnic groups. In concordance with notions of group status, the Dutch majority group showed relatively high levels of ethnic distance towards migrants. However, of the five ethnic groups under investigation, Moroccans reported the highest levels of ethnic distance. Second, results show that family cohesion, expressed through the adherence to strict family norms and contacts within the family network, is related to more resistance to ethnic intermarriage. This supports the idea that family cohesion fosters a preference for interactions with culturally similar persons since people from different cultural backgrounds can be seen as threatening the cultural identity and solidarity of one's own group. Traditional family values were related to more resistance, while qualitative good relations related negatively to the resistance to intermarriage. The last finding confirms the notion that affective and warm (family) relations increase tolerance and positive attitudes towards ethnic out-groups. Third, with respect to migrant characteristics, the results indicated that Dutch language proficiency leads to less resistance to ethnic intermarriage, while migration out of family reasons increases the resistance to ethnic intermarriage. No association was found between the intermarriage attitude and generational status or length of stay. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
