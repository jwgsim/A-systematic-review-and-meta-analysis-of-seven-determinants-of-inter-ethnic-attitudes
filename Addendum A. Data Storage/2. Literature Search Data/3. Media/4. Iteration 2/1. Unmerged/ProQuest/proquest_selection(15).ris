T1  - ‘In the end you adapt to anything’: Responses to narratives of resilience and entrepreneurship in post-recession Spain
AN  - 2694867439
AB  - Resilience – the ability to bounce back from hardship – is a concept that has become popular during the years of economic crisis and post-recession. Contemporary citizens are expected to be flexible, have a positive attitude and take care of themselves in a context of heightened inequality and precarity. The objective of this article is to analyze how citizens in post-recession Spain respond to media representations that prescribe these values. Eight focus groups were held with middle- and working-class men and women (a total of 62 participants) who discussed four short stories written by the researchers, which condensed the main concepts found in media narratives studied previously (including TV series, reality TV, advertisements, video games and celebrity culture). The results of our analysis show that participants tended to praise change and adaptability. The ‘complacent citizen’, who seeks security and refuses to adapt to the current precarious and unstable environments, emerges as a ‘bad citizen’, and security and stability are pathologized. There were differences between the middle- and working-class groups: while the former clearly adhered to the neoliberal discourse that sees flexibility and self-improvement as a moral obligation, the latter showed a more ambivalent response to these discourses.

T1  - Extreme party animals: Effects of political identification and ideological extremity
AN  - 2661293158
AB  - Many Americans’ political identity is more relevant, salient, and central than their American identity. Political parties provide party members with an identity and belief system. Political identities influence identity‐based ideologies which increase affective polarization and potential anti‐social intergroup conflict between political parties. The purpose of the current research is to determine how political party identification and ideological extremity influences affective polarization for Republicans and Democrats across two studies. Participants in both studies completed a survey which measured political identification, ideological extremity, and uniquely operationalized measures of affective polarization, including support for co‐partisans, attitudes about political rivals, emotions towards political rivals, action tendencies towards political rivals, and perceived threat from political rivals. Study 1 (N = 530) used responses to the survey from a convenience sample crowdsourced by Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) in 2018. Study 1 showed that higher political party identification is associated with significantly higher affective polarization for members of both parties and that ideological extremity partially mediates this effect. Study 2 (N = 260) used a 2020 AMT sample to replicate Study 1’s results. Findings extend our understanding of identity‐based ideological extremity and suggest that affective polarization could be driven by political party identification and partisans’ ideological extremity.

T1  - Standing up or giving up? Moral foundations mediate political differences in evaluations of BLACK LIVES MATTER and other protests
AN  - 2687742244
AB  - Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests challenge the existing social order whereas other protests do not (e.g., gun‐rights protests). Some protests even reinforce it (e.g., Blue Lives Matter protests). Protests challenging the social order align with “individualizing” moral foundations (e.g., fairness, harm/care) but undermine “binding” moral foundations (e.g., loyalty, authority), which may partially explain political differences in approval of protesting. Four studies examined whether moral foundation endorsement mediated the effect of political orientation on protest evaluations. In Study 1, liberals rated BLM protests and general protesting as more moral than conservatives, partially due to increased individualizing and decreased binding endorsement. Studies 2–4 replicated this pattern for BLM and general protesting, but these effects disappeared for gun‐rights protests and largely reversed for Blue Lives Matter protests, which uphold the status quo. These results suggest that protest evaluations partially reflect the moral values prioritized by different political groups.

T1  - Socialising Chinese nationalism: Education and media
AN  - 2652708195
AB  - This study discusses the socialisation experiences of young Chinese from two different education backgrounds and media environment. Through a survey on the attitudes of students from Macau and mainland China towards nationalism‐related news events using a survey, this study has revealed that their education social background and media‐use patterns have a greater impact on students' attitudes towards political events (military parade and Occupy Central) than cultural events (Tu Youyou's Nobel Prize and championship of women's volleyball team), and the differences of their attitudes vary depending on the events in question. Moreover, mainland students are more nationalistic and supportive of the official mainland media's discourse on sovereignty issues, but more sceptical of its sources on events of conflicts between Chinese ethnicities. The findings of this study have revealed how wider media exposure impacts the attitudes of individuals; additionally, it responds to the debates on whether people are more inclined to recognise their existing common identities or influenced by the political regimes constructed by the elites; most importantly, it tests the socialising experiences of nationalism among young Chinese from different educational and media backgrounds.

T1  - A feminist hacklab’s resilience towards anti-democratic forces
AN  - 2652518595
AB  - Makerspaces and hacklabs are believed to encourage a positive attitude towards gaining computer skills. Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category ‘Woman’ is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term ‘women’ ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one’s own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.

T1  - Closing the Knowledge Gap: How Issue Priming Before Presidential Debate Viewing Encourages Learning and Opinion Articulation: PROD
AN  - 2631516276
AB  - One mechanism by which citizens learn about candidates and issues is through watching presidential debates. Some scholars have raised concerns that these events, however, disproportionately benefit those already high in political knowledge more so than others with lesser knowledge levels. We hypothesize that knowledge begets knowledge because it prompts a constructive cognitive process that results from elaboration and reflection. We test this hypothesis in an experiment that also considers whether issue priming could help mitigate the deficit that those lower in political sophistication have when viewing campaign events. Participants (N = 543) watched a 9-minute segment focusing on economic issues drawn from the first 2020 presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joseph Biden. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to an issue priming condition and viewed the debate segment after reading a narrative text on economic policy, and the other half read an unrelated text. The study presents a model that reveals the following: (a) cognitive elaboration mediates the relationship between prior political knowledge and learning from a campaign event, (b) providing citizens with background issue–related knowledge produces a similar elaborative effect as did preexisting political knowledge, and (c) participants demonstrate greater political opinion articulation following this enhanced elaboration leading to more learning. The implications for cultivating a knowledgeable democratic electorate are discussed.

T1  - Coalitional Lobbying and Intersectional Representation in American Rulemaking
AN  - 2623235967
AB  - Interest groups representing the marginalized regularly neglect advocacy on behalf of their most vulnerable constituents—those with intersectional disadvantage. Yet, they claim that such advocacy is central to their missions. I argue that interest groups representing women, people of color, Native nations, and the poor strategically conduct intersectional advocacy through coalitional lobbying. I test this claim using a new dataset of cosignature patterns within public comments on proposed federal agency rules submitted by a set of such groups between 2004 and 2014. I find that these groups are significantly more likely to pursue intersectional advocacy in coalitions but that coalition work, alone, does not relate to influential intersectional advocacy. Rather, it is particular coalition characteristics, including organizational diversity and financial capacity, that predict such influence. I conclude that collaborative lobbying is an effective tactic for mediating representational bias in interest group advocacy and promoting more pluralistic administrative policy making.

T1  - Suicide among Older People in Different European Welfare Regimes: Does Economic (in)Security Have Implications for Suicide Prevention?
AN  - 2679753591
AB  - Older adult suicide rates vary widely within Europe, and differential welfare policies might contribute to this. We studied variations in economic indicators and suicide rates of people 65+ across 28 European countries and examined the effects of these indicators on suicide rates, grouping countries according to their socio-political systems and welfare regimes. Suicide data was obtained from the WHO European Mortality Database. The European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and the European Union Labour Force Survey provided data on economic indicators. Linear mixed models were applied. Suicide rates ranged from 4.22/100,000 (Cyprus) to 36.37/100,000 (Hungary). Material deprivation was related to elevated suicide rates in both genders in the pooled data set and in men but not women in the Continental and Island countries. Higher ratio of median income (65+/under 65) was associated with lower likelihood of suicide in women in the South-Eastern European countries. In the Nordic region, the 65+ employment rate was associated with a decreased likelihood of suicide in men. These factors to some extent show economic insecurity against older people, which influences the likelihood of suicide. Active labor market policies and inclusive social environment may contribute to suicide prevention in this age group.

T1  - You are what you read: media, identity, and community in the 2020 Belarusian uprising
AN  - 2647063930
AB  - The movement that mobilized to oppose Alyaksandr Lukashenka in August 2020 was notable for its ability to bridge divisions of social class, geography, age, and identity. Almost uniquely among post-Soviet revolutionary movements, the Belarusians who rose up were not divided from those who did not along clearly discernible socio-demographic, ethnic, linguistic, or regional lines. They were, however, separated by one very stark barrier: the one separating the country’s two distinct media systems, one controlled by the state, and one independent. Drawing on an original survey conducted in September 2020, just as the protest movement was reaching its peak, this article finds that respondents’ choice of news media was the strongest and most consistent predictor of their political opinions. Media, then, appear to have served not merely as aggregators of and conduits for social processes generated elsewhere, but as the producers of social and political force in their own right.

T1  - The Lack of Academic Social Interactions and Students’ Learning Difficulties during COVID-19 Faculty Lockdowns in Croatia: The Mediating Role of the Perceived Sense of Life Disruption Caused by the Pandemic and the Adjustment to Online Studying
AN  - 2633329701
AB  - The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant disruptions and changes to the educational process worldwide, and higher education institutions rapidly shifted from onsite to online education. This study aimed to explore the association between a perceived lack of academic social interactions in the online learning environment and learning and self-regulation difficulties experienced during online studying. More specifically, the mediating role of students’ senses of life disruption caused by the pandemic and their general adjustment to online studying in the previously described association was explored. A total number of 464 university students from Croatia took part in an online questionnaire. The results revealed that students who perceive a greater lack of academic social interactions also report more learning and self-regulation difficulties during online studying. Further, the perceived lack of academic social interactions affects students’ perceptions of life disruption caused by the pandemic and adjustment to online studying. Both of these mediators, in turn, affect the level of experienced learning and self-regulation difficulties. The obtained results can be helpful for introducing certain measures that could support students’ learning and reduce the possibility of adverse effects of the pandemic.

T1  - Examining Predictors and Outcomes of Decent Work among Korean Workers
AN  - 2627532438
AB  - The goal of the present study is to examine the psychology of working framework/theory with a sample of Korean workers. This study examined the structural model of sociocultural factors (i.e., economic constraints and social marginalization), psychological variables (i.e., work volition and career adaptability), and outcomes of decent work based on the psychology of working framework. This study assumed that decent work helps all workers attain a sense of self-respect, dignity, experience freedom and security in the work environment and provides an opportunity for workers to contribute to society. Data were collected from 420 Korean workers, with an average age of 39.13 years (SD = 9.26). We used a hypothesis model that did not assume a direct path from economic constraints and social marginalization to decent work and work volition and career adaptation to job satisfaction and life satisfaction. We also employed an alternative model that assumed all of its paths and compared the models’ goodness of fit based on prior studies. Results indicated that alternative models have higher goodness of fit than hypothesis models. All path coefficients were significant except for the direct path from social marginalization to work volition and career adaptability to life satisfaction. Additionally, work volition and career adaptability mediated both the relationship between social marginalization and job satisfaction and between marginalization and life satisfaction. This study enabled the comprehensive examination of the relevance of various social environments and psychological and occupational characteristics that should be considered when exploring job or life satisfaction in the process of career counseling.

T1  - Finding a Chulu (Way Out): Rural-origin Chinese Students Studying Abroad in South Korea
AN  - 2606198495
AB  - Based on multi-site research in China and South Korea, this paper examines the motivations for rural-origin Chinese students to study abroad in South Korea and how their overseas experiences are mediated by both internal and international educational hierarchies. Existing literature on transnational student mobility from Asia mainly focuses on students from urban middle-class backgrounds, while little attention has been paid to students from less advantaged backgrounds. Scholars have noted that China's seemingly meritocratic gaokao (national college entrance exam) policy in reality functions to perpetuate the structural marginalization of rural students in its educational system. This research moves beyond the internal migration paradigm by examining how social inequalities associated with the rural/urban divide are reproduced and re-articulated by the intersection of class, gender, place of origin, and time management at the transnational scale.

AN  - 2605135977
AB  - COVID-19-related incidents of xenophobia have hit the headlines. We asked participants to read about a rejection episode targeting a foreigner and we manipulated whether the rejection was motivated by COVID-19 fears or by no specific reasons. In the COVID-19 condition, the perpetrator was perceived as moral but as experiencing shame and guilt, while the target was seen as experiencing social pain. Helping intentions were predicted by either the perceived victim's social pain or morality and blame associated with the perpetrator.

T1  - An assessment of the roles of tenure and inclusion in conflict mediation at Cabo Pulmo National Park, Mexico
AN  - 2563573276
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to unify phenomena in academic and grey literature into a theory of marine spatial disappropriation based on geopolitical relationships. It is argued that conflict over marine space arises as a result of top-down sovereign control of marine resources, and that the recognition of marine tenure and greater inclusivity in marine development* decision-making would lessen conflict between users, such as artisanal fishermen and ecotourism businesses.Design/methodology/approachA preliminary literature review was conducted, followed by a research study at Cabo Pulmo National Park (CPNP) in Baja California Sur, Mexico.FindingsThe results demonstrate that though CPNP's tenure structure is unique and inclusivity is an element of its management, the degree to which it is practiced is not sufficient to eliminate the chance of eventual disappropriation and ensuing conflict.Practical implicationsThe results of this assessment can be used to strengthen the argument in favour of developing stronger requirements for deliberative democratic decision-making in marine delineation, as well as bolder social performance standards in marine development industries.Originality/valueResearch on socio-environmental revolutions are not new, but the authors contest that they are not alone a sufficient condition for achieving reduced conflict long-term. Instead, the originality of this research lies in its exploration of the importance of customary and formal tenure over marine resources, and its suggestion that this on the whole reduces conflict between exclusive and competing interests. One popular alternative, as demonstrated in numerous cases around the globe, can often be the marginalization of small-scale ocean users through the forceful appropriation of ocean resources.

We examine how professionals’ policy preferences regarding fertility levels are affected by their views on the impacts of population growth/decline and by fertility in their country of residence. The median respondent suggests intervention once fertility goes below 1.4 children or above 3.0. Three results stand out: first, demographers who are concerned about the carrying capacity of the earth are more willing to intervene than those who are less concerned. Second, the context of decision-making matters: experts living in high-fertility countries are more set on intervention than those living in low-fertility countries, but their threshold fertility level is also higher. Third, political orientation matters: right-leaning demographers are more set on government intervention than left-leaning demographers.

T1  - A new route towards more harmonious intergroup relationships in England? Majority members' proximal-acculturation
AN  - 2559713027
AB  - Although the ways that immigrants relate to UK culture has been a hot topic since the EU-referendum, little attention has been given to how majority group members such as Host Country Nationals (HCNs) relate to immigrants' culture. Thus, we explored English HCNs' globalisation-based proximal-acculturation – the extent to which they prefer to adopt aspects of immigrants' cultures and/or maintain their national culture. Using two-step cluster analysis, a pilot study (N = 63) revealed a separated, integrated, and undifferentiated cluster, with separated HCNs perceiving cultural diversity more as a threat and less as an enrichment. Using latent profile analysis in a second study (N = 220) also revealed a three strategy-solution, identifying assimilated, integrated and separated profiles. Again we examined how these strategies differed across perceptions of cultural threat and enrichment as well as other psychosocial characteristics: identifying with fellow English citizens, recognizing cultural differences whilst not being culturally embedded (constructive marginalization), and various forms of intergroup contact. Separated HCNs identified more with fellow English citizens, endorsed less constructive marginalization, perceived less cultural enrichment yet more cultural threat than HCNs following some of the other strategies. These results stress that the onus of cultural adoption lies with both groups – minorities and majority members – with English HCNs showing distinct proximal-acculturation strategies. Lastly, when exploring a variable-centred approach, proximal-acculturation orientations (cultural maintenance/adoption) mediated the relationship between cultural threat, cultural enrichment, and intergroup contact on positive feelings towards immigrants. Thus, the ways that HCNs acculturate may provide a new route towards harmonious intergroup relations.

T1  - Introduction: Transnational Feminism in a Time of Digital Islamophobia
AN  - 2501512116
AB  - In the nearly two decades following the events of 9/11, Western mainstream media have become obsessed with Islam, often sensationalizing Muslims as inherently violent, barbaric, and as undesirable Others. In the current technological era, the number of users who have taken to digital media and social networking sites (SNS) to express their anger, hatred, and even to make death threats towards Muslims has been increasing dramatically. Since before and after taking office, Donald Trump has done much to further exacerbate and justify the flames of these hateful pursuits, exemplifying the heightened state of anti-Muslim sentiment in the current digital landscape, in North America and beyond. In this interdisciplinary special issue of Islamophobia Studies Journal, we aim to a) document and make visible in the face of "fake news" and misinformation the various instances of ongoing and virulent Islamophobia and their different transnational itineraries and impacts, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, b) to document how such instances of hate and ignorance can be combatted through various modes of resistance. Specifically, this collection gathers scholarly conversations that come together at the intersection of transnational feminisms and digital Islamophobia in order to better understand how the confluences of race, gender, and religion become transmuted through digital platforms and racist, nationalist, and other violent and lethal Islamophobic ideologies.

T1  - Young people’s perceptions of substance use norms and attitudes in the LGBT community
AN  - 2487356057
AB  - Objectives: Sexual minority young people (SMYP) show higher levels of substance use than their heterosexual counterparts. This study aims to test potential LGBT community‐specific reasons assumed to affect substance use and their relationships to LGBT community participation/connectedness and substance use behaviour.Methods: Eight LGBT community‐specific reasons for substance use were tested in an online survey with 1,556 SMYP.Results: Respondents agreed that the LGBT community had liberal attitudes towards substance use (80.5%, n=1,079) and that the media portrayed substance use as a part of the community culture (66.5%, n=904). Participants disagreed that excessive partying is a part of the community (34.7%, n=470). Significant but weak correlations between reasons and community participation/connectedness or personal substance use behaviour were found. Subgroup analyses indicated male and gay/lesbian participants showed differential agreement levels to some of the reasons.Conclusion: Young people’s perceptions of substance use within the LGBT community are not associated with community participation/connectedness or personal substance use.Implications for public health: Further research is needed to better understand what factors lead to elevated levels of substance use in SMYP. This may assist in the development of adequate public health responses. Targeting problematic beliefs may have little impact on substance use in SMYP.

T1  - Insecure borderlands, marginalization, and local perceptions of the state in Turkana, Kenya, circa 1920–2014
AN  - 2479669568
AB  - Africa’s international borders have been sites of inter-ethnic and inter-state relations and media for material and cultural exchange. Drawing on archival materials and interviews, the article illustrates how decades of cross-border insecurity and violence from livestock raiding and tension over pasture and water resources have entrenched a consciousness within a marginalized Turkana community that critiques the role of the modern state as protector and provider. Their views are reinforced by a colonial legacy of marginalization of Turkana based on a hostile geographical environment, a vulnerable pastoral economy, and Turkana’s peripheral location relative to the center of political decision-making – Nairobi. Starved of development and provision of necessities since colonial times, Turkana have appropriated episodic insecurity from cross-border violence to underline the need for government to protect and provide basic infrastructure. In the process, the article reflects on the weaknesses or incapacities of the modern African state to deal with legacies of colonial administrative and development challenges in areas considered peripheral to the mainstream state.

T1  - Road and Transportation Lead to Better Health and Sustainable Destination Development in Host Community: A Case of China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)
AN  - 2608119298
AB  - Road and transportation plays a vital role in the sustainable development and prosperity of the area. This study investigates the impact of road and transportation on the health of the host community and its sustainable destination development. Data were collected from the host community and were analyzed through factor analysis and structure equation modeling to evaluate the in-hand data of the structural relationship. It is revealed that road and transportation has a significant role in the improvement of health. Moreover, income mediates the effects of accessibility and employment on health. This study will help the authorities and policy maker to formulate policy regarding road and transportation that will improve health of the host community and its sustainable development. The study is limited to the seven districts of Hazara division and explores the societal aspect of CPEC on the host community, future researcher may investigate other regions and may select some other variables such as effect on GDP, per capita income, etc.

T1  - Group Differences in the Psychological Integration Path of the Rural-to-Urban Migrants: A Conditional Process Analysis
AN  - 2596027412
AB  - At present, income and welfare inequality between migrant workers and urban natives has improved in China, but there are still many “semi-urbanized” migrant workers, whose psychological integration into the migrant city is very important for their mental health. By using a second stage conditional process model to decompose the effect of income on psychological integration into direct and indirect effects, this study explores the different psychological integration paths of migrant workers in different migration ranges, based on the data of the China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). The results show that the total effect of income on psychological integration is positive, and the value of inter-provincial samples is twice that of full samples. There is a significant difference in psychological integration paths between inter-provincial and intra-provincial samples, and when social comparison acts as a mediator, income has no direct effect on psychological integration of intra-provincial samples, while the direct and indirect effects of inter-provincial samples account for half of each other. Perceived discrimination played a reversed moderated role in the effect of social comparison on psychological integration, i.e., the lower the degree of perceived discrimination, the stronger the positive effect of social comparison on psychological integration, and vice versa. Therefore, according to the actual needs of different groups, relevant policies should be gradually adjusted to improve the psychological integration of migrant workers, thus contributing to their mental health.

T1  - Experts in Self-Isolation? Monastic Outreach during Lockdown
AN  - 2584471812
AB  - This paper draws on digital ethnography to examine the experience of a Catholic English Benedictine monastery in the context of restrictions on religious gatherings during the global COVID-19 pandemic. As the monks expand their digital presence and social media involvement, it is their experience of social withdrawal and apparent expertise in self-isolation that provides the grounding for their public engagement. While Max Weber depicts the monk as a world-transcending “virtuoso”, in a time of lockdown, this separation from the world provides a point of connection with the experience of wider society.

T1  - Status Threat, Social Concerns, and Conservative Media: A Look at White America and the Alt-Right
AN  - 2576497817
AB  - Racial and ethnic division is a mainstay of the American social structure, and today these strains are exacerbated by political binaries. Moreover, the media has become increasingly polarized whereby certain media outlets intensify perceived differences between racial and ethnic groups, political alignments, and religious affiliations. Using data from a recent psychological study of the Alt-Right, we assess the associations between perceptions of social issues, feelings of status threat, trust in conservative media, and affiliation with the Alt-Right among White Americans. We find concern over more conservative social issues along with trust in conservative media explain a large portion of the variation in feelings of status threat among White Americans. Furthermore, more conservative social issues plus feeling of status threat significantly increase the odds of Alt-Right affiliation. Most surprisingly, however, trust in conservative media mitigated, instead of amplified, these associations. Implications and calls for future research are discussed.

T1  - Smart working is not so smart: Always-on lives and the dark side of platformisation
AN  - 2561104667
AB  - This article investigates the lived experiences of remote workers during the Italian lockdown, and the role of digital platforms in their working and everyday life activities, as well as the consequences of home confinement measures on personal and working conditions. Drawing on 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper's findings suggest that, following a massive extension of transmedia work, remote workers experienced a 'fractured' and 'always-on' life. During the lockdown, the ever more pervasive role of digital media favoured the convergence of different spaces and times into the home, the erosion of the distinction between private and professional life and the exacerbation of previous social inequalities, especially inequalities in relation to gender and digital access. In this scenario, platform and surveillance capitalist logics were further reinforced, while 'presence bleed' in the experiences of workers increased.

T1  - Gender Marginalization in Sports Participation through Advertising: The Case of Nike
AN  - 2558804124
AB  - The sport sector functions as a site of health-promotion by encouraging and enabling individuals to invest in their health and giving them tools to do so. This investment is often initiated by, or altered by, role modeling, or seeing other individuals engaging in sport. This could include family or peers but could also include depictions of sport in popular media. Inclusive role-modeling could subsequently encourage more sport participation, thus expanding access to health benefits that arise from sport. However, stereotypical depictions of sports role models could make sports seem like a more exclusive space and discourage participation. We examine a case study of a prominent athletic brand and their advertising to examine the ways they expand or reify stereotypes of gender in sport. Through a qualitative content analysis of 131 commercials released by Nike in the past decade, we explore whether their stated goals of being a socially progressive company extend to genuinely diverse and inclusive portrayals of gender in their commercials. Our results indicate that Nike commercials continue to treat sports as a predominantly and stereotypically masculine realm, therefore marginalizing athletes who are female, who do not fit traditional gender binaries, or who do not display traditionally masculine qualities. We also find that the bulk of athletes portrayed by Nike are those who adhere to gender stereotypes. Despite their purported goal of encouraging individuals to participate in sports, Nike’s promotion of gendered sport behaviors may be having an opposite effect for some consumers by discouraging sports participation for those who do not align with the gendered behavior Nike promotes. The stereotyped role modeling of the sport sector portrayed in a majority of Nike commercials could dissuade already marginalized individuals from participating in the health-promoting behaviors available through sport.

T1  - Navigating Religion Online: Jewish and Muslim Responses to Social Media
AN  - 2530135619
AB  - Although social media use among religious communities is proliferating, significant gaps remain in our understanding of how religious minorities perceive social media in relation to their faith and community. Thus, we ask how individuals use religion to frame moral attitudes around social media for Jews and Muslims. Specifically, how does social media shape understandings of community? We analyze 52 interviews with Jews and Muslims sampled from Houston and Chicago. We find that Jews and Muslims view social media as a “double-edged sword”—providing opportunities to expand intracommunal ties and access to religious resources, while also diluting the quality of ties and increasing exposure to religious distractions. These findings help us understand what it is about being a religious minority in the US that might shape how individuals engage with social media. Moreover, they suggest that social media may be transforming faith communities in less embodied ways, a topic that is of particular relevance in our pandemic times.

AB  - This special issue explores the contested notion of Chineseness through an examination of the language ideologies and practices of those who are arguably on its margins. The six ethnographic cases presented in this issue not only shed light on how language mediates the relationship between race, ethnicity, and nationality, but also reveal the myriad ways in which ideologies of language, race, and nation work together to produce a variety of racial and ethnic subject positions. Expanding the scope of raciolinguistics, they demonstrate why we cannot lose sight of China and Chineseness when studying the relations between language, race, and ethnicity.

T1  - Extractivism, exclusion and conflicts in Senegal’s agro-industrial transformation
TT  - Extractivisme, exclusion et conflits dans la transformation agro-industrielle au Sénégal
AN  - 2470866142
AB  - In the last two decades, the promotion of agro-industry has become a dominant developmental imperative on the African continent, leading to efforts to involve private-sector actors. This article examines the political economy and ecology of agro-industry in the Senegal River delta, focusing on local-level reactions to Senegalese initiatives aimed at attracting foreign investors in agriculture. The argument is that Senegal is witnessing the emergence of an agro-extractivist pattern that replaces earlier development objectives – such as peasants’ integration into the national economy – with the new imperative of the integration of territories into global capitalism. The article presents empirical evidence on three main consequences of the increased presence of agro-industry: a process of change in land property and access; the end of public support to peasant farmers; and an intensified marginalisation of pastoralism. Colonial heritage and the role of local resistances in shaping and mediating this developmental strategy are also discussed.Alternate abstract:Au cours des deux dernières décennies, la promotion de l’agro-industrie est devenue un impératif de développement dominant sur le continent africain, ce qui a conduit à des efforts importants pour impliquer les acteurs du secteur privé. Cet article examine l’économie et l’écologie politiques de l’agro-industrie dans le delta du fleuve Sénégal, en mettant l’accent sur les réactions au niveau local aux initiatives sénégalaises visant à attirer les investisseurs étrangers dans l’agriculture nationale. L’argument soutenu est que le Sénégal assiste effectivement à l’émergence d’un modèle agro-extractiviste qui remplace les objectifs de développement antérieurs - tels que l’intégration des paysans dans l’économie nationale - avec le nouvel impératif d’intégration des territoires dans le capitalisme mondial. L’article présente des données empiriques sur les trois principales conséquences de la présence accrue de l’agro-industrie : un processus de transformation du régime foncier et des pratiques d’accès à la terre ; la fin du soutien public aux paysans ; et une marginalisation du pastoralisme intensifiée. L’héritage colonial et les rôles des résistances locales dans l’élaboration et la médiation de cette stratégie de développement sont également abordés.

T1  - The Intermediating Role of Municipal Urban Planners in Online Discussions with Citizens
AN  - 2469981893
AB  - We examine how urban planners in Helsinki work as intermediaries to “balance power” between actively participating citizens and more marginalised groups – citizens who do not traditionally participate – in online discussions about urban planning. We study the tensions planners experience while interacting with citizens in online environments, especially on social media. Using a questionnaire and interviews, we report on tensions between planners’ perceptions of active vs. passive roles in social media, equal vs. equitable opportunities to participate, and sides in the debate over allocation of resources. The study shows that engaging marginalised groups requires offline interventionist strategies.

T1  - Immigration policy and belonging in the Argentine ‘racial state’
AN  - 2462615412
AB  - From its very formation, the Argentine state sought to become a beacon of white, European civilization, understanding migration to be a central means toward achieving this aspirational racial project. This objective is etched into the country’s first constitution as well as institutional memories of the national immigration office, where state bureaucrats reaffirm their desire to welcome Europeans and reject ‘all human races that could introduce a different seed.’ While scholars have argued that twenty-first century discourses and immigration policies in Argentina signal important disruptions to the racial project of Argentine whiteness, this article explores the ‘stickiness’ of the aspirational racial project as it pertains to migration. It does so through in-depth analysis of a ‘moral panic’ that took place after a 2016 motorcycle theft in Buenos Aires. The incident became popularly known as ‘El Crimen de Brian,’ and culminated in immigration policy change. Through analysis of media narratives and state speech surrounding this crime, I argue that the consequences of ‘El Crimen de Brian’ dually expose the limits of human-rights based immigration policies when they are undergirded by exclusionary conceptions of citizenship and national belonging, as well as the fragile citizenship of those who are marked as external to dominant national projects. Through discussion of the Argentine case, this article bridges conversations regarding race, nationhood and migration and discussions about the securitization of migration.

T1  - How people access the internet and the democratic divide: Evidence from the Chilean region of Valparaiso 2017, 2018 and 2019
AN  - 2478257045
AB  - The Internet has been often described as a tool that fosters the inclusion of traditionally marginalized people in the democratic process. Yet, if the type of device used by people to access the Internet impacts their online democratic engagement, uneven Internet penetration and differences in the devices used by social groups will result in a deeper democratic divide. After discussing the impact of the types of internet use and type of access devices on civic engagement, we postulate 3 hypotheses on how democratic values and type of access to the Internet-place and devices-are related to the civic use of social media. We use data from a Valparaíso Regional poll in Chile in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to test those hypotheses. People who access the Internet via mobile phones are less likely to use social media with a civic purpose, while those who access the Internet at home or work are more likely to do so. Since low-income sectors primarily access the Internet via mobile phones while higher income groups have a wider array of Internet connection options, the rapid growth of cell phone use for accessing the Internet risks deepening social and income gaps in civic engagement.

T1  - Do national cultures matter in the containment of COVID-19?
TT  - Culture and the containment of COVID-19
AN  - 2476606157
AB  - PurposeThis paper empirically investigates how cultural variations in individualism and tightness affected the containment of COVID-19 using data from 54 nations during a 30-day period of government intervention.Design/methodology/approachThe authors utilized the hierarchical regression approach to check the effects of three cultural variables – the individualism measure, taken from Hofstede’s six-dimension national culture index, and the measure of cultural tightness, based on the three tightness–looseness indexes calculated by Irem Uz (2015) and their interaction – on the changes in the prevalence rate (ΔPR) and crude mortality rate (ΔCMR) and case fatality rate (CFR) while controlling for the stringency of government responses to COVID-19, median age and population density.FindingsSignificant relationships were found between cultural variables and national performance in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, measured by ΔPR, ΔCMR and CFR. After controlling for the stringency of government responses, median age and population density, the authors found that cultural tightness and individualism as well as their interactions remain to be pivotal. Loose and individualistic cultures led to faster increases in PR and CMR and higher CFR. A four-quadrant conceptual framework is developed to categorize and discuss the national differences.Originality/valueThe paper integrated two constructs – cultural tightness–looseness and individualism–collectivism – to form a theoretical lens to guide the authors’ analyses while using the real-time COVID-19 data as a natural experiment for theorizing and testing. This study’s findings have significant policy implications in government responses, strategic planning, cultural adaptability and policy implementations for the world’s continuous battle against the pandemic.

T1  - How collectively organised residents in marginalised urban settlements secure multiple basic service enhancements: Evidence from Hyderabad, India
AN  - 2411478693
AB  - Residents of marginalised urban settlements in low- and middle-income countries jointly experience multiple short-term basic service deficits which impair their health and broader wellbeing. A wide range of bottom-up strategies has been identified and employed to enhance basic service access in these contexts, but few scholars have attempted to conceptually organise these strategies. This study synthesises the disparate means identified in the literature to effect jointly experienced basic service access enhancements. It draws on fieldwork conducted in four notified slums situated in Hyderabad, India, to create a typology of the full range of strategies employed by collectively organised residents, illustrate how strategies interact in practice, and suggest a prioritisation of strategies with reference to the extent of pressure they exert on the local urban state to improve service provision over time. The study finds that high-pressure strategies which alter the incentives of public agencies and align them with those of residents appear the most promising to mediate the tension between short-term and long-term service needs.

T1  - Longitudinal pathway from violence exposure to firearm carriage among adolescents: The role of future expectation
AN  - 2467814112
AB  - Introduction
Exposure to violence is a risk factor for firearm carriage. Youth exposed to violence also have difficulty envisioning positive future outcomes (e.g., educational outcomes), which can increase the likelihood of firearm carriage over time. Researchers, however, have not yet examined whether changes in exposure to violence over time can influence the developmental trajectories of firearm carriage. To address this gap, we (1) examined the longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage (grades 9 to 12) and then (2) examined whether changes in future expectations mediated this longitudinal association.
Method
The longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage through future expectations was examined among 850 adolescents from the Flint Adolescent Study. Participants were recruited from four high schools in a midwestern city in the United States. Parallel latent growth models and latent growth mediation models were estimated.
Results
A positive association was observed between the rate of change in exposure to violence and firearm carriage. Exposure to violence also indirectly increased the risk for firearm carriage over time by decreasing future expectation in the 9th grade.
Conclusions
Our results support the idea that helping youth develop positive attitude about educational success may help reduce firearm carriage. Increasing positive expectations about future may help prevent firearm carriage within the context of violence exposure.

T1  - THE USE OF DIGITAL MEDIA TECHNOLOGY TO PROMOTE FEMALE YOUTH VOICES AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT IN RURAL AREAS OF THOHOYANDOU, SOUTH AFRICA
AN  - 2427545119
AB  - For several years digital media played a significant role in bridging the information gap between the information have and have-nots in developing societies. This article focuses on how previously marginalised female youth in rural South Africa use digital media to voice societal issues and the extent to which these technologies breaks down barriers for women empowerment. Quantitative method was employed and data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire disseminated to selected 100 females from rural areas of Thohoyandou-South Africa. The data were analysed using SPSS version 9 and the results were analysed using descriptive statistics. The study established that majority of female youth used digital media to voice social concern which attributed to socio-economic development. The paper maintains that a constant access to digital media by female youth is indicative of the great potential for empowering them through harnessing digital media.

T1  - The Diverging Presence of Youth in Public Discourse: A Comparative Analysis of Youth-Related Debates Across Countries and Issue Fields: PROD
AN  - 2391184584
AB  - Youth is a recurrent topic of public debates, particularly because youth features in almost all issue fields discussed in mass media, ranging from educational and cultural to criminal matters. However, previous research has highlighted that youth is not necessarily actively involved in raising its own voice within the public sphere, which gives cause for concerns about the representation of youth in public discourses and thus in democratic opinion formation. This article wishes to critically assess the proposition that young people are objects of public discourses rather than active participants. For this purpose, it will analyze public statements reported in newspapers of nine countries (Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom). The analysis makes conceptual use of claims-making analysis and tries to identify contextual factors that determine the extent to which youth actors actively participate in public discourses. In particular, we wish to assess whether discursive inclusion or exclusion of youth is patterned along countries and/or policy fields. Our findings show that policy fields are the most important contextual factors. Moreover, considering claims and actors, public debates about youth are rather similar between the nine countries. This indicates that public debates about youth are patterned by a similar, cross-national differentiation along policy domains.

T1  - Empathy to action: Child and adolescent out‐group attitudes and prosocial behaviors in a setting of intergroup conflict
AN  - 2388833715
AB  - The paper explored how to promote constructive intergroup relations among children and young people in a context of protracted conflict. Across two studies, the Empathy–Attitudes–Action model was examined in middle childhood and adolescence. More specifically, we tested the relations among dispositional empathy, out‐group attitudes, and prosocial behaviors for youth born after the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. In one correlational (Study 1: N = 132; 6–11 years old: M = 8.42 years, SD = 1.23) and one longitudinal design (Study 2: N = 466; 14–15 years old), bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that empathy was associated with more positive attitudes toward the conflict‐related out‐group, which in turn, was related to higher out‐group prosocial behaviors, both self‐report and concrete actions. Given that out‐group prosocial acts in a setting of intergroup conflict may serve as the antecedents for peacebuilding among children and adolescents, this study has intervention implications.

T1  - Framing the Opioid Crisis: Do Racial Frames Shape Beliefs of Whites Losing Ground?
AN  - 2507991420
AB  - Context: Although research has begun to examine perceptions of being on the losing side of politics, it has been confined to electoral politics. The context of health disparities, and particularly the opioid crisis, offers a case to explore whether frames that emphasize racial disadvantage activate loser perceptions and the political consequences of such beliefs.
Methods: White survey participants (N = 1,549) were randomized into three groups: a control which saw no news article, or one of two treatment groups which saw a news article about the opioid crisis framed to emphasize either the absolute rates of opioid mortality among whites or the comparative rates of opioid mortality among whites compared to blacks.
Findings: Among control group participants, perceiving oneself a political loser was unrelated to attitudes about addressing opioids, whereas those who perceived whites to be on the losing side of public health had a less empathetic response to the opioid crisis. The comparative frame led to greater beliefs that whites are on the losing side of public health, whereas the absolute frame led to more empathetic policy opinions.
Conclusions: Perceptions that one's racial group has lost ground in the public health context could have political consequences that future research should explore.

T1  - Leadership as a Reflection of Who We Are: Social Identity, Media Portrayal, and Evaluations of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 2254204387
AB  - The 2016 U.S. Presidential election presented a unique opportunity to study gender and leadership. Using the social identity theory of leadership (Hogg 2001) as a guiding framework, we sought to understand the effect of social identities—gender and political affiliation—on voters’ evaluations of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in this election. We surveyed 440 participants’ attitudes toward female leaders, political affiliation, level of media exposure, and their evaluations of Clinton’s charisma and effectiveness in Study 1. Results indicate that female voters, those with favorable attitudes toward female leaders, and Democrats were more likely to support Clinton; these relationships were strengthened by media exposure. Contrary to predictions, gender attitudes and political affiliation did not have a significant interaction effect on evaluations of Clinton. In Study 2, we conducted a content analysis of the media’s portrayal of Clinton on both ends of the political spectrum. Our findings revealed that partisan news outlets with opposite political leanings did significantly differ in their portrayal of Clinton’s prototypicality and competence as a leader. As a result, media coverage acted to magnify the role of political affiliation in voters’ evaluations of Clinton’s suitability for the highest political office. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - The immigrant labeling effect: The role of immigrant group labels in prejudice against noncitizens: GPIR
AN  - 2323389808
AB  - Five experiments (N = 2,251) and a meta-analysis examine how group labels shape Americans’ levels of prejudice, behavioral intentions, and policy preferences toward immigrants living in the US without authorization. These studies extend research documenting how the perceived negativity of group labels (e.g., those describing gay people) affects people’s downstream attitudes. To this end, Study 1 examines the perceived negativity of the five most commonly used labels to describe unauthorized immigrants. Study 2 found that relatively negative (vs. neutral) labels (e.g., illegal aliens vs. noncitizens) engendered more prejudice, punitive behavioral intentions, and greater support for punitive policies. Study 3 replicates these effects and examines the role of familiarity. People who personally knew members of the group were more positive towards them overall, but were nevertheless susceptible to the labels’ influence. Studies 4 and 5 provide additional replications and explore prejudice as a mediator of behavioral intentions and policy preferences.

T1  - Drastic Dykes: The New South and Lesbian Life
AN  - 2323120889
AB  - Two leading southern urban centers, Charlotte, North Carolina and Atlanta, Georgia, are connected by their competing notions of metropolitan identities as put forward by city leaders. Both serve as home to lesbians who define themselves in accordance with their urban surroundings. In 1970s Charlotte and Atlanta, lesbian feminists established spaces, formed organizations, held conferences, created print media outlets, and worked to define a visible community essentially linked to the urban identity of each city. This article demonstrates that while Atlanta is often recognized as the primary location of southern women's activism, equally important and enduring lesbian-feminist action took place in Charlotte. A small but overlooked group of activists in Charlotte left a permanent mark on the collective lesbian-feminist landscape, and by examining the development of lesbian-feminist groups in these two cities, we understand the significance of southern lesbian action on the national stage of women's history.

T1  - SCHOOL MEDIATORS AS A MECHANISM FOR INCREASING EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN ROMA COMMUNITIES
AN  - 2371415552
AB  - The issue of Roma education is a widely discussed subject in the recent literature. The low level of education is an important indicator of the Roma population's socio-economic precariousness. An important and innovative mechanism that aims to increase the educational level and to produce empowerment in Roma communities is the school mediator. In Romania, the school mediator has been recognized as a professional role since 2001, but there are not enough monitoring activities and statistical data regarding the impact of this integration mechanism on communities. This paper aims to identify and discuss some important dimensions of the work of school mediators in Braşov County, Romania. We carried out a content analysis of the school mediators' reports which are periodically sent to the County School Inspectorate Braşov. Our results suggest that school mediators represent an important human resource for better understanding Roma communities and for providing new place-based tools that could contribute to increase Roma education level and their social integration.

T1  - Exposure to Urban Nature and Tree Planting Are Related to Pro-Environmental Behavior via Connection to Nature, the Use of Nature for Psychological Restoration, and Environmental Attitudes
AN  - 2251669244
AB  - Pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) may be associated with a personal relationship with nature. We conducted a quasi-experiment with 423 residents who had or had not actively participated in a tree-planting scheme and lived in 20 neighborhoods that differ in their greenness level. We tested whether exposure to nature (specified by the amount of vegetation cover in residents’ neighborhoods) and/or past PEB (specified by tree-planting participation) was associated with residents’ PEB and whether key psychological constructs would mediate these relationships. Structural equation mediation models revealed that the level of neighborhood vegetation and involvement in the planting scheme explained 46% of the variance in PEB, with connection to nature, the use of nature for psychological restoration, and environmental attitudes mediating the relationships. Connection to nature was more strongly associated with engagement in PEB than the use of nature for psychological restoration and environmental attitudes.

T1  - Where was the Afro in Afro-Asian Solidarity? Africa's 'Bandung Moment' in 1950s Asia *
AN  - 2245665552
AB  - In June 1954, the Asian Socialist Conference (ASC) published the first edition of its Anti-Colonial Bureau News Letter. After reporting the recent Bureau meeting in the Burmese hill-station of Kalaw, the news became overwhelmingly African: political crisis in Buganda, a new constitution for Tanganyika, Mau Mau and Kwame Nkrumah's electoral success in Gold Coast. The editor of the News Letter and Joint Secretary of the ASC, working in Rangoon, Burma, was a young West African journalist, James Gilbert Markham. Such statism at Bandung was but one of many crucibles of Afro- Asian solidarity in the 1950s, a decade of multiple internationalisms within and beyond freedom movements and post-colonial states. Chris Lee convincingly argues that Bandung served as an unstable communitas--a community of feeling--based on the shared experience of Western imperialism. Bandung intended to provide a distinct, even utopian, alternative to the preceding era through a discourse of Afro- Asian solidarity.

T1  - Culture, Religion and Sexual Diversity in Lesotho
AN  - 2229915428
AB  - This paper explores community dialogues as social interaction in search for sexual diversity in Lesotho, in an effort to influence positive and more directional thinking towards sexuality and sexual behaviour. Guided by queer theory, we firstly explore cultural and religious dimensions defining acceptable and unacceptable sexual behaviour; their influence on attitudes towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (or queer) and intersex (LGBTQI) community, leading to their daily negative encounters; and, lastly, we suggest community dialogues as a mediator that influences more positive attitudes and guides acceptability towards this vulnerable population. Three main themes emerged after the adoption of a thematic analysis: there is denial of the LGBTQI existence; stigma and discrimination towards this minority population also prevail; and the LGBTQI population in Lesotho experience emotional and physical attacks.

T1  - Self‐criticism and self‐reassurance as mediators between mental health attitudes and symptoms: Attitudes toward mental health problems in Japanese workers
AN  - 2227707687
AB  - Japanese workers suffer high rates of mental health symptoms, recognised recently by the Japanese government, which has enacted workplace well‐being initiatives. One reason for poor mental health concerns negative attitudes about mental health problems such as shame, which may be mediated by self‐reassurance and self‐criticism. This study aimed to evaluate shame‐based attitudes toward mental health problems and explore the relationship between mental health attitudes, self‐criticism, self‐reassurance, and mental health symptoms. Japanese workers (n = 131) completed three measures: attitudes toward mental health problems, mental health symptoms, and self‐criticism/reassurance. A high proportion of workers reported negative attitudes about mental health problems. There were strong relationships between mental health attitudes, mental health symptoms, self‐criticism, and self‐reassurance. Path analyses revealed that the total and indirect effects (through self‐criticism and self‐reassurance) of mental health attitudes on mental health were larger than the direct effect alone. Hated‐self and family reflected shame were identified as predictors for mental health symptoms. The findings suggest the importance of self‐criticism and self‐reassurance in mental health and mental health attitudes. Implications for help‐seeking behaviours also are discussed. Interventions aimed at reducing self‐criticism and enhancing self‐reassurance are recommended to improve mental health attitudes and increase help‐seeking in Japanese workers.

T1  - Exclusion by design: intersections of social, digital and data exclusion
AN  - 2223806670
AB  - As smart technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly embedded into commercial and government services, we are faced with new challenges in digital inclusion to ensure that existing inequalities are not reinforced and new gaps that are created can be addressed. Digital exclusion is often compounded by existing social disadvantage, and new systems run the risk of creating new barriers and harms. Adopting a case study approach, this paper examines the exclusionary practices embedded in the design and implementation of social welfare services in Australia. We examined Centrelink's automated Online Compliance Intervention system ('Robodebt') and the National Disability Insurance Agency's intelligent avatar interface 'Nadia'. The two cases show how the introduction of automated systems can reinforce the punitive policies of an existing service regime at the design stage and how innovative AI systems that have the potential to enhance user participation and inclusion can be hindered at implementation so that digital benefits are left unrealised.

T1  - Precarity and Survival in Tara June Winch’s After the Carnage
AN  - 2242080374
AB  - A number of the first- and third-person protagonists/narrators (male and female, straight and gay, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, Australian and non-Australian) of these stories are marked by their precarious lives, their poverty and their marginalisation; and violence of various kinds (intimate partner violence, family/domestic violence and global terror), is represented as impacting on these lives.

[...]the narrative provides enough of a 'back-story' to explain, if not excuse, his mother's retreat into risk-taking behaviour, at both a personal and historical level, as an Aboriginal woman who has had to cope with being left by her husband and having a number of abusive relationships after this, being homeless and having to scrape together a living in unskilled jobs, and eventually having a more stable home, partner and baby, only to have this taken from her in a reprise of the painful earlier loss of her still-born baby.

[...]as in 'Failure to Thrive', she draws attention to the double standards in 'first world' responses to world suffering, where the trope of distance is used as self-justification for their apathy.

[...]a man at the party in a newly-fashionable suburb of Brooklyn, attended by the woman and the man, watches images on a muted television of houses being blown up, in an unnamed war zone, and declares: 'From this distance nothing looks especially violent' (147).

[...]Police are Taking Family Violence as Seriously as Terrorism.'

T1  - Hispanic Male Cancer Survivors’ Coping Strategies
AN  - 2235550832
AB  - Cancer survivors manage their new status using a multitude of coping mechanisms. Coping strategies vary by individual, but are also socioculturally mediated. Scarce evidence on coping strategies adopted by Hispanic male cancer survivors (HMCS) is available to date. The purpose of this study was to explore the reaction to diagnosis and subsequent coping strategies employed by HMCS. Data were gathered through focus groups (n = 18), cognitive interviews (n = 12), and phone interviews (n = 84). Coping strategies included positive attitudes, humor, optimism and social support, use of home remedies, lifestyle changes, and faith. Findings are consistent with research on non-cancer-related coping showing that HMCS use active coping strategies, such as religion and support from family and friends. The analysis of existing strategies and needs points to the need to develop evidence-based psychosocial services that build on strengths and coping behaviors already employed by HMCS.

T1  - FOR QUEER ASIAN AMERICAN YOUTH WHO ARE RESILIENT AND TENACIOUS: HOW QUEER ASIAN AMERICAN YOUTH AND THEIR ADVOCATES CONFRONT THE TENSIONS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES
AN  - 2317569628
AB  - Even though Asian Americans are one of the fastest-growing populations in the US, increasing 46 percent between 2000 and 2010, faster than any other minoritized groups, Asian Americans only constitute 5.6 percent of the US population, just over 17 million people. Thus, they are often overlooked and invisible when it comes to political discussion, media representation, educational research, and especially, queer discourse. Here, Kha discusses the queer Asian American youth's experiences in navigating schools and tensions that erupt between queer discourse and the values that shape Asian American youth.

T1  - Social Inclusion Despite Exclusionary Sex Offense Laws: How Registered Citizens Cope With Loneliness
AN  - 2176101427
AB  - The use of social media has become associated with empowerment, social capital, and social inclusion for members of marginalized groups in society. Few groups in today’s social environment are as marginalized, if not more, than sex offenders. This article explores the use of social media among 112 registered sex offenders who are in the community, no longer under correctional control, and self-report no reoffending. Self-reports of desistance were triangulated through interviews with 38 spouses/relatives of registrants and arrest data. Unlike prior studies of sex offenders’ use of social media to facilitate offending, we found the use of social media helps create informal social networks, reduces loneliness, and provides a sense of empowerment among sex offenders and their family members. These are all factors important to promoting public safety and reducing sexual recidivism.

T1  - Controversies in the standardization of the interactivity middleware of the Brazilian Digital TV: technical democracy to the test of the normative device of the innovation Ginga
AN  - 2220523928
AB  - The goal of this text is to rebuild the scene of the controversial standardization of Ginga, the interactive middleware of the digital Brazilian TV which final architecture generated the combination of two languages: NCL-Lua (open code) and Java-DTV (owner). Our purpose is to demonstrate how, in the terms of the technical democracy, the dispute among distinct actors of the Brazilian Digital and Interactive TV System (SBTVi) took place between the management of symbolic digitalization, high definition and interaction in service of the market and government’s social inclusion projects by open TV. We are interested on the values and norms proposed by researchers, developers, broadcasters, government, software industry, leaders of social movements in favour of the democratization of the communication concerning the standardization device Ginga, the SBTVi Forum. The history of Ginga exemplifies how the standardization o innovation are associated with social and technical schemes in which technical and human issues get attached and turn apart according to the course of deals. Based on the realization of documental analysis and semi-structured interviews, we discuss the constitution of a border-object output of conflicts among actors who express diverse participations on the interactive project combined with the Brazilian social inclusion and industrial politic, purposes initially attributed to the SBTVi.

T1  - Postcolonial migrations in Russia: the racism, informality and discrimination nexus
TT  - Postcolonial migrations in Russia
AN  - 2184352528
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to contribute to the challenges of bringing postcolonial, racism and migration research into a meaningful dialogue. Based on the research examining migration from Central Asia into Russia, the paper analyses migration policy and the everyday experiences of migrants.Design/methodology/approachThe paper is based on mixed methodologies, including narrative, semi-structured and in-depth interviews with migrants from Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan in Russian cities and those who returned to their country of origin (over 300 people), interviews with representatives of NGOs, state officials and journalists in 2013–2016 and an analysis of the legislation and mass-media regarding migration from Central Asia.FindingsThe paper demonstrates that experiencing racism is a part of everyday life for migrants from Central Asia living in Russia. Whether this is in interactions with the state, fear of persecution on the street by the police or in the workplace, it is a constant factor. It argues that the political and everyday xenophobia and racism demonstrates deeply rooted imperial views in Russia’s inner politics and shapes attitudes toward migrants.Social implicationsThe paper contributes to broader debates on the linkages between migration and racism in Europe, in particularly questioning the positionality of migrants from “not-European” countries.Originality/valueMbembe’s approach to “let die” is pertinent in understanding postcolonial migration. Racism continually plays a role in “normalization” of abuse toward migrants and restrictive migration policy. Blaming “the migrant” for acting informally, draining healthcare resources and for posing a security risk provides a much-needed scapegoat for the state.

T1  - Work and well-being in TGNC adults: The moderating effect of workplace protections
AN  - 2173762313
AB  - The present study used a psychology of working theory (PWT) framework to test the direct and indirect relations of perceived social status and transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) marginalization (i.e., victimization, nonaffirmation of gender identity, negative expectations for the future) with work volition, overqualification, and vocational and emotional well-being outcomes (i.e., job satisfaction, meaningful work, satisfaction with life, depression) in a sample of 175 TGNC working adults. This study also tested the moderating effect of one form of structural marginalization (lack of legal protections from employment discrimination) on the overall pattern of results. Participants were recruited using online social media and discussion forums and completed the study survey online. For the full sample, perceived social status and nonaffirmation of gender identity were associated with vocational and emotional well-being outcomes through the mediating role of work volition, and for some paths, overqualification. Significant differences emerged in the overall pattern of results for those without protections, suggesting that protections from discrimination buffer the adverse links of some forms of TGNC marginalization with work volition and vocational outcomes. Implications of study findings for research, counseling, and advocacy are provided.

T1  - Transforming Obstetric Fistula through Concealment in Niger
AN  - 2116800147
AB  - Obstetric fistula, a birthing injury caused by obstructed labor and that results in chronic incontinence, is frequently described by donor and media narratives as an eminently visible condition resulting in social stigma. However, through ethnographic research in four fistula centers in rural and urban Niger, this research revealed that the majority of the 100 women interviewed hid their conditions from their communities, kin, and even husbands. Women invested their time, energy, and finances into these strategic acts of concealment. Yet, concealment came at a high price to women's psychosocial health as the women who were most successful in "passing" as whole and healthy were often seen by their kin and communities to have rejected vital tenets of relational reciprocity. Additionally, it was often fistula centers that unintentionally undermined women's concealment efforts, outing them within their communities. This research demonstrates the importance of ethnographic insight in reshaping fistula interventions to better serve women.

T1  - All Talk and No Action? Racial Differences in College Behaviors and Attendance
AN  - 2067682543
AB  - According to the influential “oppositional culture” account, we should expect black students as a group to be less likely to engage in school than their white counterparts because they are more likely to believe and act in opposition to academics. In contrast to this prediction, qualitative and quantitative researchers have almost uniformly deduced that black students hold similar or higher educational values, attitudes, and expectations as compared with whites. I pull from the rich literature on racial differences in educational attitudes and expectations to posit that instead of black students shirking education, black students are actually more likely to act in favor of education, and that this might help explain their higher net rates of college attendance as indicated in prior research. Using the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), I find that black students’ higher rates of engagement in college-going behaviors mediate the relationship between race and college attendance so that race is no longer a significant predictor of attendance. Implications for how these results can address racial disparities in college attendance are discussed.

T1  - Women over 40, foreigners of color, and other missing persons in globalizing mediascapes: understanding marketing images as mirrors of intersectionality
AN  - 2059484487
AB  - Media diversity studies regularly invoke the notion of marketing images as mirrors of racism and sexism. This article develops a higher-order concept of marketing images as "mirrors of intersectionality." Drawing on a seven-dimensional study of coverperson diversity in a globalizing mediascape, the emergent concept highlights that marketing images reflect not just racism and sexism, but all categorical forms of marginalization, including ableism, ageism, colorism, fatism, and heterosexism, as well as intersectional forms of marginalization, such as sexist ageism and racist multiculturalism. Fueled by the legacies of history, aspirational marketing logics, and an industry-wide distribution of discriminatory work, marketing images help to perpetuate multiple, cumulative, and enduring advantages for privileged groups and disadvantages for marginalized groups. In this sense, marketing images, as mirrors of intersectionality, are complicit agents in the structuration of inequitable societies.

T1  - Time for “resilience”: Community mediators working with marginalised young people offer a novel approach
TT  - Community mediators
AN  - 2089269054
AB  - PurposeSince the 2008 financial crisis, state retrenchment has added to the harshness of life for marginalised groups globally. This UK study suggests community activism may promote human capacity and resilience in innovative ways. The purpose of this paper is to address the relationship between non-normative understandings of time and resilience.Design/methodology/approachThis research paper is based on qualitative study of the work of a third sector organisation based in an urban area in the UK which provides training in mediation skills for community mediators (CMs). These CMs (often former “gang members”) work with young people in order to prevent conflict within and between groups of white British, South Asian and Roma heritage.FindingsCMs are reflexively developing temporalities which replace hegemonic linear time with a situationally “open time” praxis. The time “anomalies” which characterise the CMs’ engagement appear related to aesthetic rationality, a form of rationality which opens up new ways of thinking about resilience. Whether CMs’ understandings and enactments of resilience can point to broader changes of approach in the delivery of social care is considered.Practical implicationsThis paper contributes to critical understandings of resilience that challenge traditional service delivery by pointing to an alternative approach that focusses on processes and relationships over pre-defined outcomes.Social implicationsHegemonic understandings of time (as a linear process) can delegitimise potentially valuable understandings of resilience developed by members of marginalised communities.Originality/valueThis paper is original in developing a critical analysis of the relationship between resilience and time.

T1  - Designing for social inclusion of immigrant women: the case of TeaTime
AN  - 2042098723
AB  - We present our design of a digital service supporting social inclusion among immigrant women in an ethnically and socially diverse neighbourhood of a small Finnish town. The aim is to explore experiences and perceptions as well as potential barriers and challenges for using the web-based service. The case study is framed as design research having a strong user-centred design approach. We describe the design process and present the results of a mixed-method evaluation. The results are scrutinized from the perspectives of experience design. The analysis reveals a potential to facilitate social inclusion through the fulfilment of needs related to relatedness, autonomy, competence, pleasure and stimulations as well as popularity. However, some challenges in the interface design and communication of the security and purpose of the site were identified in the study. Significant differences were also found between immigrant women and local people regarding the need for this digital service.

T1  - Official bilingualism meets de facto multilingualism: public service interpreting for the Chinese in Catalonia
AN  - 2024607858
AB  - Catalonia is well known for being a bilingual region with language policies that give full support to promoting Catalan. More recently, the number of languages spoken in Catalonia has risen significantly due to immigration flows, while immigration policies encourage all citizens living in Catalonia to be able to communicate in Catalan with the public Administration. The same immigration policies, however, also acknowledge that interpreting (or intercultural mediation) may be necessary to facilitate immigrants’ rights to access public services during the first few years they are living in Catalonia. This article analyses the relationship between a minoritized language (Catalan), a dominant language (Spanish) and a group of recently arrived languages (Standard Chinese and other Chinese varieties) from the perspective of public service interpreting. It discusses some of the results of an empirical qualitative research which included: (a) interviews with public service interpreters and intercultural mediators working with Chinese living in Catalonia, (b) interviews with managers and coordinators in charge of interpreting or mediation services, and (c) questionnaires answered by Chinese users of public services in Catalonia. This research depicts a complex reality: it not only reflects interpreters’ and managers’ biases towards Spanish or Catalan, often motivated by their place of origin or life experience, but also the challenges when dealing with linguistic variation, i.e. the variety of languages (geolects and mutually unintelligible dialects) included under the umbrella term of Chinese.

T1  - Gay Fathers on the Margins: Race, Class, Marital Status, and Pathway to Parenthood
AN  - 2008324924
AB  - To investigate stratification within gay fatherhood communities. As laws and attitudes have become friendlier to queer families in recent decades, gay fathers have experienced increased visibility in and through both media and scholarship. However, this visibility has been distributed unevenly along normative patterns of marital status, race, class, and kinship. Participant observation of gay fathers groups was conducted in California, Texas, and Utah over a period of 61 months. Using theoretical sampling of group members, 56 gay fathers also participated in semistructured interviews. Themes were identified and refined through a 3-stage iterative coding process, consistent with a grounded theory approach. Findings suggest that single gay fathers, gay fathers of color, and gay fathers who had children in heterosexual contexts occupy marginalized statuses within the gay fatherhood community. Gay fathers develop distinct mechanisms of resilience to respond to the challenges associated with their marginalization. The experiences of gay fathers on the margins highlight the negative consequences of gay fatherhood discourses that reproduce family normativity. The resources available through gay parenting groups simultaneously played a role in gay fathers' well-being, resilience, and marginalization. Efforts to expand opportunities for gay families should consider coalitions with other marginalized family forms. Gay parents who had children in heterosexual unions should be specifically targeted through gay parenting outreach.

T1  - MOCK JUROR PERCEPTIONS OF POLICE SHOOTINGS: THE EFFECTS OF VICTIM RACE AND SHOOTING JUSTIFIABILITY
AN  - 2278890255
AB  - Recent police shootings of African Americans have led citizens to question police officers' use of force. Thus, it is important to determine whether mock jurors can distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable police shootings-and whether their judgements depend on victim race. Media attention could lead jurors to be more punitive in cases in which an officer shoots an African American (compared to Caucasian) victim. A punitive verdict would reflect society's opposition to such shootings, as suggested by the bandwagon effect. In a 2 (Shooting: Justified/Unjustified) x 2 (Victim's race: African American/Caucasian) experiment, mock jurors read a trial summary involving a fatal police shooting and indicated verdicts. Unjustifiable shootings resulted in less positive perceptions of the officer and perceptions that the shooting was less justified. When the victim was African American, participants had more positive perceptions of the victim, were more certain in a guilty verdict, and perceived the shooting as less justified. The interaction indicated that victim race affected verdicts, but only when the shooting was unjustified. Results suggest there is bias against officers who unjustifiably shoot African Americans, supporting the bandwagon effect. Implications for the role of media effects, psychology, and the legal system are discussed.

T1  - Transformation of Images of Power and Political Leaders of Great Britain Under the Influence of Brexit (on Materials of European and American Media, 2014-2017): Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2099452814
AB  - The political images formed in the mass consciousness largely determine not only the attitude of citizens to certain political events and objects, but also their political behavior. Due to the fact that modern politics is increasingly becoming virtual, one should not underestimate the impact of mass communication on the formation of these images. It is obvious that the contextual factor, including situational changes occurring in the political arena both inside the country and outside it, is the determining factor in the content of the information that comes from the media and on the basis of which, accordingly, political images are formed in the mass consciousness. The article attempts to analyze the transformation of communicative images of power and political leaders of Great Britain under the influence of Brexit, i.e. during the period from 2014 to 2017. Since the main economic partners of this country are the United States and the European Union countries, the main news channels of these countries served as the source of data for the content analysis: American CNN and FOX News, as well as European Euronews and France24. According to the methodology developed at the Department of Sociology and Psychology of the Politics Department of the Lomonosov Moscow State University, a study was carried out which main goal was to compare the communicative images of power and political leaders of Great Britain in terms of strengths, weaknesses, attractiveness, unattractiveness, activity and passivity before and after Brexit. According to the results of the research, it was found that the image of power, regardless of the country’s media affiliation, undergoes minor changes, which can’t be said about the image of D. Cameron. The data obtained during this kind of research not only gives an idea of the actual image broadcasted by the media, but also allows us to identify both the psychological mechanisms of its formation and the limits of the influence of the media on the stable mental structures of citizens. In practice, such data can allow to determine those actions that the country needs to take to form its image and information strategy.

T1  - Deaf Gain Goes Prime Time: Identity, Spaces, and Marginalization in ABC Family's Switched at Birth
AN  - 2007003812
AB  - Airing from 2011 to 2017 on ABC Family, the drama series Switched at Birth remains one of the best examples of disability representation in recent television history. As the first mainstream television series to incorporate both deaf actors and American Sign Language (ASL), Switched at Birth represents the increasing recognition of Deaf culture in modern media. The drama series, although primarily geared toward a mainstream teenage hearing audience, offers a relatively nuanced exploration of marginalized communities and identities, particularly those in relation to race and disability. The show follows its Deaf protagonist as she navigates her life and relationships from her time at Carlton School for the Deaf as an activist to a mainstream hearing college as a premedical student. In doing so, the show acts a visual yet educational narrative, informing the viewer about the complexities of marginalization and the disabled experience. With its unique narratives and diverse characters, Switched at Birth can be regarded as not only an attempt at greater disability representation in media discourse, but also a Deaf space that fosters inclusion and acceptance of identities that are outside the mainstream.

T1  - Peer Exclusion During the Pubertal Transition: The Role of Social Competence
AN  - 1983623363
AB  - For some youth, early puberty is accompanied by peer exclusion. Yet early developers may experience less peer exclusion if they have social competence, which would bolster their ability to develop and maintain positive relationships with their peers. Accordingly, the present study tests whether pubertal timing and tempo predicts decrements in children’s social competence and whether decrements in social competence account for associations between puberty (timing and tempo) and peer exclusion over time. Longitudinal data were drawn from 1364 families (48% female; 76% White; M = 9.32 years, SD = .48, at Wave 3) who participated in Waves 3–5 (i.e., grades 4–6) of Phase III of the NICHD-SECCYD. The results from latent growth curve models indicated that earlier pubertal timing and more rapid pubertal tempo among girls were associated with high initial levels of peer exclusion. Moreover, mediation analyses revealed that early developers’ susceptibility to peer exclusion was associated with their initial level of social competence. In boys, pubertal timing and tempo were not directly associated with peer exclusion; instead, indirect effects of pubertal timing on peer exclusion (intercept, slope) occurred through initial levels of social competence. On average, early developers’ who had low levels of social competence also had high initial levels of peer exclusion but experienced decrements in peer exclusion over time. The association between the intercepts for puberty and peer exclusion and the slopes for social competence and peer exclusion were stronger for boys than girls. Overall, our findings suggest that early developers’ susceptibility to and experiences of peer exclusion are associated with their development of social competence.

T1  - MEDIA DISCOURSE ON WOMEN AND POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN NIGERIA IN THE CONTEXT OF FEMINIST THEORY: AN ASSESSMENT
AN  - 2112126381
AB  - Discourse on women and the discrimination that they suffer in social relations continue to animate discussion about the roles and place of women across societies especially in Africa. It is within the context of the discourse on the nature of the relationship that the term gender emanates. Thus, gender as use in social science discourse highlights the nature, forms and dynamism of social relations between men and women and how this inform power, privileges and aspirations between the sexes. As a social issue, discourse on gender within the media (print, electronic and social media) has gained ascendancy. The media as agenda setting institution has elevated discussion on gender relations inclusive of the discourse on women 's active participation in the political process and the implications that its portends for national development. Therefore situating its discussion within the context of liberal feminist theory and drawing insights from news articles, opinion pieces, editorial, and commentaries from Nigerian newspapers and published academic materials this paper examines media discourse on women 's political participation within the Nigerian political space. It highlights the centrality ofmedia presentation to the task of advancing women 's participation in the political process in Nigeria 's Fourth Republic.

T1  - Ageing well? A cross-country analysis of the way older people are visually represented on websites of organizations for older people
AN  - 2049976025
AB  - The 'aging well' discourse advances the idea of making older people responsible for their capability to stay healthy and active. In the context of an increased ageing population, which poses several challenges to countries' government, this discourse has become dominant in Europe. We explore the way older people are visually represented on websites of organizations for older people in seven European countries (Finland, UK, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Poland and Romania), using an analytical approach based on visual content analysis, inspired by the dimensional model of national cultural differences from the Hofstede model (1991; 2001; 2011). We used two out of the five Hofstede dimensions: Individualism/Collectivism (IDV) and Masculinity/Femininity (MAS). The results demonstrated that in all seven countries older people are mostly visually represented as healthy/active, which reflects a dominant 'ageing well' discourse in Europe. The results also demonstrated that in most cases older people tend to be represented together with others, which is not consonant with the dominant 'ageing well' discourse in Europe. A last finding was that the visual representation of older people is in about half of the cases in line with these Hofstede dimensions. We discuss the implications of these findings claiming that the 'ageing well' discourse might lead to 'visual ageism'. Organizations could keep this in mind while using pictures for their website or in other media and consider to use various kind of pictures, or to avoid using pictures of older people that stigmatize, marginalize or injure. They could look into the cultural situatedness and intersectional character of age relations and consider alternative strategies of both visibility and invisibility to talk with and about our ageing societies.

T1  - Online Civic Engagement and the Anti-domestic Violence Movement in China: Shifting Norms and Influencing Law
AN  - 1947061711
AB  - In the context of China’s new law against domestic violence, proposed by the State Council in November 2014 and passed in July 2015, this article examines online engagement by Chinese citizens leading up to the legislative revision, and examines the Sina Weibo microblog activities of one influential organisation, nǚquán zhī shēng (Feminist Voice). I ask how a Chinese Civil Society Organisation (CSO) uses online media to open public discourse on, and in some cases challenge, formal and informal institutions around a normatively marginalised issue, the case of domestic violence. Drawing on and synthesising literature on domestic violence, civil society and online communications in China, this study provides a timely contribution given the relative limitedness of up-to-date data, after the huge wave of publications following the 1995 Beijing conference. Findings are based on content analysis of the Feminist Voice microblog during 2012. While Chinese CSOs are often dismissed as non-confrontational and therefore ineffective change agents, Feminist Voice does challenge status quo marginalisation of domestic violence in the public sphere and facilitate discussion around formal and informal institutional reform, thereby influencing social attitudes and potentially also policy and law making. Alternate abstract:Dans le contexte de la nouvelle loi chinoise contre la violence familiale, proposée par le Conseil d’État en novembre 2014 et votée en juillet 2015, cet article examine l’engagement en ligne des citoyens chinois précédant la révision législative et examine les activités du microblog Sina Weibo d’une organisation influente, « n ǚ quán zh ī sh ē ng » (Voix féministe). Je demande comment une organisation de la société civile chinoise utilise un média en ligne pour ouvrir le débat public et, dans certains cas, contester les institutions officielles et officieuses sur une question marginalisée sur le plan normatif, la violence domestique. Synthétisant et s’appuyant sur la documentation concernant la violence domestique, la société civile et les communications en ligne en Chine, cette étude apporte une contribution opportune compte tenu des limites relatives des informations à jour après le flot immense de publications suite à la Conférence de Beijing de 1995. Les conclusions reposent sur l’analyse du contenu du microblog Voix féministe en 2012. Tandis que les organisations de la société civile (OSC) chinoise sont souvent considérées comme des agents de changement non conflictuels et donc inefficaces, Voix féministe remet bien en cause la marginalisation fixe de la violence familiale dans la sphère publique et favorise la discussion sur la réforme officielle et non officielle des institutions, influençant ainsi les attitudes sociales et peut-être aussi les politiques et les législations.Alternate abstract:Vor dem Hintergrund von Chinas neuem Gesetz gegen häusliche Gewalt, das vom Staatsrat im November 2014 vorgelegt und im Juli 2015 verabschiedet wurde, untersucht dieser Beitrag das Online-Engagement chinesischer Bürger, welches die legislative Revision herbeigeführt hat, und betrachtet die Mikroblogging-Aktivitäten der einflussreichen Organisation nǚquán zhī shēng („Feministische Stimme“) auf Sina Weibo. Man geht darauf ein, wie eine chinesische Bürgergesellschaftsorganisation Onlinemedien dazu nutzt, eine öffentliche Diskussion über formelle und informelle Institutionen hinsichtlich eines normativ marginalisierten Themas wie häusliche Gewalt einzuleiten bzw. in einigen Fällen die Institutionen in Fage zu stellen. Die Studie fasst die Literatur zu den Themen häusliche Gewalt, Bürgergesellschaft und Onlinekommunikationen in China zusammen und stellt, wenn man berücksichtigt, dass die aktuellen Daten relativ beschränkt sind, einen zeitgerechten Beitrag im Anschluss an die immense Zahl von Veröffentlichungen nach der Konferenz in Peking 1995 bereit. Die Ergebnisse beruhen auf einer Inhaltsanalyse des Mikroblogs von „Feministische Stimme“im Jahr 2012. Chinesische Bürgergesellschaftsorganisationen werden häufig als nicht konfrontativ und somit als ineffektive Betreiber des Wandels abgetan; doch hinterfragt „Feministische Stimme“sehr wohl die gegenwärtige Marginalisierung häuslicher Gewalt im öffentlichen Bereich und fördert die Diskussion über eine formelle und informelle institutionelle Reform, wodurch sie Einfluss auf die gesellschaftlichen Einstellungen und möglicherweise auch die politischen und legislativen Entscheidungen ausübt.Alternate abstract:En el contexto de la nueva ley china contra la violencia doméstica, propuesta por el Consejo de Estado en noviembre de 2014 y aprobada en julio de 2015, el presente artículo examina el compromiso online de los ciudadanos chinos que ha llevado a la revisión legislativa, y examina las actividades del microblog Sina Weibo de una influyente organización, nǚquán zhī shēng (Voz Feminista). Planteo cómo una organización de la sociedad civil china (OSC/CSO) utiliza los medios online para abrir el discurso público sobre, y en algunos casos cuestionar, las instituciones formales e informales en torno a una cuestión marginada normativamente, el caso de la violencia doméstica. Basándose y sintetizando el material publicado sobre violencia doméstica, la sociedad civil y las comunicaciones online en China, el presente estudio proporciona una contribución oportuna dada la relativa limitación de datos actualizados, tras la enorme ola de publicaciones como continuación a la conferencia de Beijing de 1995. Los hallazgos se basan en el análisis de contenido del microblog de Voz Feminista durante 2012. Aunque las organizaciones de la sociedad civil (OSC/CSO) a menudo son descartadas como agentes de cambio no beligerantes y por lo tanto ineficaces, Voz Feminista realmente cuestiona la marginación de la violencia doméstica por parte del status quo en la esfera pública y facilita el debate en torno a la reforma institucional formal e informal, influyendo de este modo en las actitudes sociales y potencialmente también en la formulación de políticas y leyes.Alternate abstract:在国务院于2014年11月提出,2015年7月通过的中国新家庭暴力法背景下,本文探讨了推动这一法律修订的中国公民网上交互,同时调查了一家具有影响力组织——女权之声的新浪微博活动。我询问了一家中国CSO如何使用网上媒体展开公共讨论,以及在一些情况下挑战普遍被边缘化问题的正式和非正式制度,如家庭暴力。本研究编制和综合中国民间团体的家庭暴力文献和网上讨论,为1995年北京会议之后大量发行的出版物之后的相对数据局限性作出贡献。调查结果基于女权之声2012年期间发布的新浪微博的内容分析。尽管中国民间团体(CSO) 通常以非对抗形式解散,从而无法推动变革,但女权之声仍在挑战家庭暴力的边缘化现状,并且促进正式和非正式制度改革的讨论,从而影响社会态度以及潜在的政策和法律制定。Alternate abstract:中国の家庭内暴力に対する新法については、2014 年 11 月に国務院が提案して2015 年 7 月に通過したが、本論文では、契約法改正に至るまでの中国市民によるオンラインでの関わりにおいて、影響力のある組織nǚquán zhī shēng (女性の声)の新浪微博のマイクロブログ活動を調査する。中国 CSO では公共の通信網にオンライン・メディアが使用されているが、規範社会から取り残されている問題、つまり家庭内暴力といった問題を持つ公式もしくは非公式の機関に対処する方法を提示している。本研究では、家庭内暴力、市民社会、中国のオンライン通信に関する文献を用いて統合することで、1995 年の北京会議に続く出版社の波以降から最新データにおける制約を提示して、時宜にふさわしい貢献を提供する。調査結果は、2012年中にフェミニスト音声マイクロブログの内容分析に基づいている。中国の市民社会組織 (CSO) は非対立的であるため、非効率的な変更を示す主体となる。フェミニストの声は、公共圏における家庭内暴力の現状での疎外に挑戦しており、それによって社会的態度および潜在的態度にも政策と立法に影響を与える形式的で非公式な制度改革の議論を容易にする。Alternate abstract:ي سياق القانون الصيني الجديد ضد العنف المنزلي، الذي تم إقتراحه عن طريق مجلس الدولة في نوفمبر 2014 والذي تمت الموافقة عليه في يوليو 2015، تبحث هذه المقالة المشاركة على الإنترنت عن طريق المواطنين الصينيين التي أدت إلى التعديل التشريعي، ودراسة أنشطة المدونات الصغيرة في الموقع الإليكتروني (Sina Weibo) وأحد المنظمات المؤثرة، (nǚquán zhī shēng) (صوت نسائي). أنا أسأل كيف تستخدم منظمات المجتمع المدني (CSO) الصينية وسائل الإعلام على الإنترنت لفتح نقاش عام ، وفي بعض الحالات تتحدي ، المؤسسات الرسمية والغير رسمية حول مشاكل المهمشين معياريا”، مشكلة العنف المنزل. بالإعتماد على تجميع عناصر الأدب بشأن العنف المنزلي، المجتمع المدني، والإتصالات على الإنترنت في الصين، تقدم هذه الدراسة مساهمة في الوقت المناسب نظرا” للمحدودية النسبية لتصل إلى البيانات حتى الآن، بعد موجة ضخمة من المنشورات بعد مؤتمر بكين عام 1995. تستند النتائج على تحليل المحتوى من المدونات الصغيرة للصوت النسوي خلال عام 2012. بينما غالبا” ما يتم صرف النظر عن منظمات المجتمع المدني (CSO) الصينيةعلى أنها غير تصادمية وبالتالي عناصر تغييرغير فعالة، الصوت النسوي يتحدى وضع التهميش الراهن للعنف المنزلي في المجال العام وتسهيل النقاش حول الإصلاح المؤسسي الرسمي والغير رسمي، بالتالي التأثير في المواقف الإجتماعية وإحتمال أيضا” صنع السياسات و القانون.

T1  - Negative intergroup contact and support for social policies toward the minority outgroup in the aftermath of a natural disaster
AN  - 1900994929
AB  - In this field study, we tested whether negative intergroup contact experienced by majority (Italian) survivors in the aftermath of the earthquakes that struck Northern Italy in 2012 was associated with policy attitudes toward minority (immigrant) survivors. Results revealed a negative association between negative contact and support for social policies aimed at favoring immigrant survivors. Moreover, social policies toward immigrant survivors mediated the effect of negative contact on social policy attitudes toward the minority group as a whole. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of findings.

T1  - How do journalists leverage Twitter? Expressive and consumptive use of Twitter
AN  - 2077572001
AB  - This study examined factors that affect journalists’ Twitter use behaviors based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A survey of Korean journalists supported that TPB is a useful theoretical framework for understanding journalists’ Twitter use behaviors. This study found that three TPB variables – positive attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control – are positively associated with journalists’ general Twitter use (i.e., time spent using Twitter). More importantly, beyond looking at journalists’ general Twitter use, this study expands the literature by distinguishing between expressive Twitter use (e.g., tweeting messages) and consumptive Twitter use (e.g., reading others’ tweets). Results showed that journalists’ attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls were associated differently depending on patterns of expressive and consumptive Twitter usage. Given the role of professional journalists in society, their ways of using Twitter may have a profound impact on the ecology of journalism. Contributing to the literature of the theory of planned behavior by extending its explanatory power to professional journalists’ Twitter usage, the results of this study suggest that future research on journalists’ Twitter use should pay more attention to how Twitter is employed within the journalistic context.

T1  - Mrs Thatcher's peacock blue sari: ethnic minorities, electoral politics and the Conservative Party, c. 1974-86
AN  - 1947105603
AB  - The image of Margaret Thatcher appearing on television dressed in a 'peacock blue sari' must seem rather farfetched-and yet, for a brief moment, it appeared a distinct possibility. That such an event seemed plausible reflected the growing recognition among senior Conservatives of the electoral significance of ethnic minority voters. While Conservatives had begun to experiment with measures to appeal to BAME voters as early as 1951, from the mid-1970s formal party structures dedicated to the recruitment and representation of BAME voters began to emerge. In 1976 the Party launched the Anglo Asian Conservative and the National Anglo West Indian Conservative Societies, both of which sought to address poor performance among black and Asian voters. This paper explores the development of Conservative electoral strategies targeting BAME voters in the period after 1951, and reflects on what these strategies reveal about Conservative narratives of the nation in the 1980s.

AN  - 2023908438
AB  - College students are frequent social media users. Heightened racial tensions across college campuses and the United States have increased the volume of racial discourse on social media, suggesting a need to understand social media's influence on how students make meaning of race. Using symbolic interactionism and racial identity theories, this qualitative study examined the social media engagement of 10 undergraduate students of Color and its impact on their understanding of race and racial identity.

T1  - "We Have Bigotry All Right-but No Alabamas”: Racism and Aboriginal Protest in Canada during the 1960s
AN  - 1910289146
AB  - On Nov 22, 1965, four hundred Aboriginal men and women gathered at the Indian Friendship Centre in Kenora, Ontario. They prepared to march, a new sight to the town's ten thousand non- Aboriginal residents. With cold winter air pressed against their faces, they linked arm-in-arm four persons across and began what would be a quarter of a mile trek north along Main Street. Bundled in winter coats that hid their suits and dresses underneath, they passed by the Kenricia Hotel, the Woolworth's department store, and Fife's Hardware. The sight of peaceful marchers counteracted many of the common stereotypes that marked Aboriginal bodies in early 1960s Canada. These were not Hollywood Indians dressed in war paint, nor were they the drunk, docile, passive Indians portrayed through local media. Here, Rutherford discusses history of the march, what motivated it, how it came to life, and what took place in its aftermath.

T1  - Does Gender Matter? Testing the Influence of Presumed Media Influence on Young People's Attitudes toward Cosmetic Surgery
AN  - 1877731686
AB  - The present study examined gender differences in young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery as well as the joint effects of media and peers on their attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. A survey of 555 university students in Singapore showed that young people of both sexes generally held positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. We observed no significant gender disparities in their acceptance of cosmetic surgery or intention to undergo cosmetic surgery. We tested the influence of the presumed media influence model, and our findings supported direct and indirect models of media influence on young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. The indirect model was mediated by perceived influence of cosmetic surgery-related media on peers. We also found that men were more susceptible to the influence of presumed media influence than women were. Practice implications of our study for educators include open discussions regarding cosmetic surgery and the influence of media and peers among young people, as well as differentiating intervention programs for emerging adult women and men.

T1  - Does Inflammation Mediate Relationships Between Racial Identity and Onset of Menopause Among US Adults?
AN  - 1969968149
AB  - We assess how well differences in ethnoracial background may predict timing of menopause among females in the USA and whether or not inflammatory biomarker levels appear to mediate these overall associations. We use data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) to model apparent net effects from race on menopausal onset, as well as possible mediating influences from the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). Using continuous time event history analysis, we assess and frame overall relationships between race and menopausal age. We use structural equation modeling to assess potential mediating effects from CRP and to estimate direct and indirect components of these apparent effects. Our findings suggest that on average, black females experience menopause earlier than their peers of other racial backgrounds, and have higher inflammatory biomarker levels. Both black race and higher CRP have negative and significant direct associations with menopausal age. CRP appears to partially mediate the overall association between black race and earlier menopause. This apparent mediation persists with statistical controls for income, education, and body mass index. Our study concludes with recommendations for future research on racial identity, inflammation, and menopausal onset. We focus our recommendations on intersectional forms of inequality that may affect black females in later life.

T1  - “Santísima Muerte, Vístete de Negro, Santísima Muerte, Vístete de Blanco”: La Santa Muerte’s Illegal Marginalizations
AN  - 1888976406
AB  - La Santísima Muerte, the death saint patron of the marginalized and dispossessed in Mexico, the United States, and beyond, is especially favored by devotees who identify with her duality between dark and light, and good and evil. Most of Santa Muerte’s devotees understand that good and evil coexist in her, and they often simultaneously appeal to both. At the same time, illegality and marginalization, which are generally associated with the saint’s “dark” or “evil” sides, take on multiple, diverse forms, encompassing criminalized activity such as narcotrafficking, religious transgressions that reflect unorthodox spiritual practices such as witchcraft, and most contentiously of all, the very conditions of poverty and racialization in Mexico. Nevertheless, cultural representations of Santa Muerte often resist such diversity and persist in opposing her dark and light sides. Films such as Eva Aridjis’s La Santa Muerte and Pável Valenzuela Arámburo’s La Santísima Muerte aim to represent all Santa Muerte in all of her multiplicity and to correct stereotypical representations of the death saint in general. But perhaps inadvertently, Aridjis’s film reinforces the contrast, rather than the intersections, between “light” and “dark”. However, in La Santísima Muerte, Valenzuela Arámburo deliberately embraces the saint’s contradictory duality to provide a different perspective on illegality and criminality, simultaneously accepting such illegality as a dark menace in the vein of Santa Muerte’s typical detractors, and rearticulating it as a necessary aspect of the saint’s holy works. Valenzuela Arámburo’s film not only emphasizes that the very same devotees invoke Santa Muerte for her powers of “good” as well as for those of “evil”, it demonstrates that these devotees incorporate the saint’s dark side as they see fit not as a consequence of their marginalized status, but as a means to resist it. Thus, while both films underscore that marginalized populations are just as nuanced and contradictory as their patroness of death is, Valenzuela Arámburo’s film grounds itself in Santa Muerte’s duality in order to demonstrate how her seemingly contradictory aspects construct and shape each other. As such, the film combats the representation of marginalization and criminality in Mexico and beyond, highlighting the extent to which her devotees appeal to both her dark and light sides precisely because they are simultaneously victims of marginalization and agents of resistance.

T1  - Heterosexual Dating Double Standards in Undergraduate Women and Men
AN  - 1819312036
AB  - Traditional heterosexual dating and courtship scripts (e.g., men pay for date, women take partner's last name in marriage) reflect different standards of desirable behavior for women and men. Analogous to sexual double standards, dating double standards reflect the greater agency and power traditionally accorded to men in society. In the present study, we investigated factors related to young heterosexual adults' endorsement of dating double standards. Participants were 330 female and male U.S. undergraduates at a California public university (57 % female, ages 18-25 years-old) from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In the Heterosexual Dating Double-Standards Scale, respondents rate the desirability of five dating and courtship behaviors (initiate date, hold door open, pay for date, propose marriage, take spouse's last name) separately for women and men. Preliminary analyses revealed participants generally expressed double standards by rating the desirability of behaviors differently for female and male characters in the traditional direction (e.g., paying for a date rated more desirable for a man than for a woman). We predicted dating double standards would be positively related to factors previously found to predict traditional gender roles (viewing popular media, religious attendance) as well as attitudes that reflect traditional views (conservative political beliefs, benevolent and hostile sexism, disavowing a feminist identity). These hypotheses were generally supported. Among these correlations, dating double standards were strongly associated with benevolent sexism (among women and men) and with hostile sexism (among men). Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Examining Two Theoretical Models Predicting American and Dutch Parents' Mediation of Adolescent Social Media Use
AN  - 1799008549
AB  - The goal of the present study was to utilize two theoretical models, one based on a mediation approach and the other on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), to understand parents' mediation of their adolescents' social media use. Data were collected from parents of adolescents ages 10-18 in two countries, the United States (US) and the Netherlands. Results indicated significant differences between the two samples. Specifically, American parents reported more concern about adolescent social media use, more positive attitudes and perceived subjective norms to control adolescent use, and higher levels of active and restrictive mediation. In general, demographics and parental concern accounted for more explained variance in mediation behaviors among Dutch parents, and the TPB-based variables accounted for more explained variance among American parents. Results suggest important implications for the integration of different theoretical models to explain parent mediation behavior.

T1  - Perceived moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination
AN  - 1796451720
AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

T1  - Understanding the Relationships between Gender Inequitable Behaviours, Childhood Trauma and Socio-Economic Status in Single and Multiple Perpetrator Rape in Rural South Africa: Structural Equation Modelling
AN  - 1789207222
AB  - Background 
Interventions to prevent rape perpetration must be designed to address its drivers. This paper seeks to extend understanding of drivers of single and multiple perpetrator rape (referred to here as SPR and MPR respectively) and the relationships between socio-economic status, childhood trauma, peer pressure, other masculine behaviours and rape.
 Method 
1370 young men aged 15 to 26 were interviewed as part of the randomised controlled trial evaluation of Stepping Stones in the rural Eastern Cape. We used multinomial to compare the characteristics of men who reported rape perpetration at baseline. We used structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine pathways to rape perpetration.
 Results 
76.1% of young men had never raped, 10.0% had perpetrated SPR and 13.9% MPR. The factors associated with both MPR and SPR (compared to never having raped) were indicators of socio-economic status (SES), childhood trauma, sexual coercion by a woman, drug and alcohol use, peer pressure susceptibility, having had transactional sex, multiple sexual partners and being physically violent towards a partner. The SEM showed the relationship between SES and rape perpetration to be mediated by gender inequitable masculinity. It was complex as there was a direct path indicating that SES correlated with the masculinity variable directly such that men of higher SES had more gender inequitable masculinities, and indirect path mediated by peer pressure resistance indicated that the former pertained so long as men lacked peer pressure resistance. Having a higher SES conveyed greater resistance for some men. There was also a path mediated through childhood trauma, such that men of lower SES were more likely to have a higher childhood trauma exposure and this correlated with a higher likelihood of having the gender inequitable masculinity (with or without the mediating effect of peer pressure resistance).
 Discussion 
Both higher and lower socio-economic status were associated with raping. Prevention of rape perpetration must focus on changing men’s gender ideals, entitlements and inequitable practices. Reducing poverty and adverse childhood experiences should also be of benefit.

T1  - Davabirzhaot! Conflicting claims on public space in Tbilisi between transparency and opaqueness
AN  - 1722447335
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the form of young male socialisation referred to as birzha, in its relation to public space in Georgia. Birzha defines a group of young men who meet regularly in urban open spaces in Tbilisi's neighbourhoods. Partly considered as the initial step of a criminal career, belonging to birzha is a mark of identification with one's local group. The contested nature of public space is illustrated by the conflicting relation between birzha's bottom-up use of public space and top-down projects of urban renovation sought by Saakashvili's government. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon literary and media sources, and analysing fieldwork data collected in 2008-2009 and 2014, this study explores how the announced (re)construction of public space under Saakashvili resulted in institutional interventions from above which curtailed public space's accessibility. Findings - The present analysis points out contradictions in Saakashvili's government's political narrative on public space. In the institutional focus on a future of order, transparency, and democracy, birzha is an insistent reminder of an informal and corrupted past. Banned from futuristic projections of the public space, in the present birzha is annihilated by state repression, enforced in opaque zones out of public sight. Originality/value - Focusing on a largely overlooked phenomenon in social science research, the paper highlights the ways in which conflicting approaches to public space affect the relation between political institutions and citizens. Delving into ambivalent public/private divides in post-socialist societies, the study of Georgian birzha offers an original angle for investigating the contestation of urban public space in relation to political legitimacy and transparency.

T1  - Does Anyone Care about Black Women?: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1690634030
AB  - One hundred fifty years after Harriet Tubman helped free 750 slaves during the Raid at Combahee Ferry, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons chose to commemorate her legacy by releasing a highly offensive web video titled Harriet Tubman Sex Tape. At best, Simmons is utterly clueless about the realities of black female victimization during slavery; at worst, he's a willfully ignorant misogynist who delights in minimizing the pain of slavery and rape of black women. On Jul 30, 2013, Russell Simmons had been outraged with black CNN news anchor Don Lemon for having such a limited view of black struggle that the latter would suggest that ceasing use of the N-word, a halt to wearing sagging pants, and a reduction in teen pregnancy and absentee fatherhood are the solutions to what ails black communities. In his apology issued at Global Grind on Aug 15, 2013, Simmons remarked that he thought a portrayal of Tubman outwitting the slave master was politically correct.

T1  - THE INFLUENCE OF WORKPLACE OSTRACISM ON COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORK BEHAVIOR: THE MEDIATING EFFECT OF STATE SELF-CONTROL
AN  - 1550134616
AB  - The authors investigated the influence of workplace ostracism (WOS) on counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and the mediating effect of state self-control (SSC) on the above relationship, in a Chinese cultural context. They based their study on the theory of self-control resources. To avoid common method bias, they examined their hypotheses with 356 pairs of supervisor-subordinate dyads and collected data from 26 enterprises in central China. They used structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that WOS was positively related to both organizational and interpersonal employee CWB. In addition, the results showed that SSC mediated the relationship between WOS and CWB. Implications for theory and management are discussed.

T1  - Unpacking the Use of Social Media for Protest Behavior: The Roles of Information, Opinion Expression, and Activism
AN  - 1429629655; 201336644
AB  - Recent studies have shown a positive link between frequency of social media use and political participation. However, there has been no clear elaboration of how using social media translates into increased political activity. The current study examines three explanations for this relationship in the context of citizens' protest behavior: information (social media as a source for news), opinion expression (using social media to express political opinions), and activism (joining causes and finding mobilizing information through social media). To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy. Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior. These findings deepen our knowledge of the uses and effects of social media and provide new evidence on the role of digital platforms as facilitators of direct political action.

T1  - The role of online communication in raising awareness of bilingual identity
AN  - 1492599868; 201400717
AB  - Children of binational couples are often raised in the community of one of the parents and, thus, have limited exposure to the language of the other parent. This study focuses on a British/Moroccan family in the UK, where English is the dominant home language and Moroccan Arabic is the 'other' language. Analysis of 'live' family conversations at home in the UK and 'online' conversations with cousins in Morocco indicate that using Moroccan Arabic at home is often seen as a chore, whereas in online conversations it is seen as fun. The use of computer-mediated communication appears to have contributed to a more positive attitude towards using the language and developing a bilingual identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Overcoming cop culture? Organizational justice and police officers' attitudes toward the public
AN  - 1448996327; 201344345
AB  - Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to test theories of organizational justice in the context of a police agency. Design/methodology/approach -- Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyze data from a survey of officers in a police force in England. Findings -- The SEM showed that organizational justice was associated with positive attitudes towards serving members of the public. This relationship was mediated by commitment to elements of community policing and, for community police officers, by general satisfaction with the organization. Practical implications -- The findings suggest that police managers committed to implementing process-based policing policies may need to ensure their organizations also implement internal policies and practices that are procedurally fair. Originality/value -- This study is one of the first to apply the well established literature on organizational justice to the context of policing, and the first to examine the impact of organizational justice on alignment with community policing and the service model.

T1  - Environmental concern and fertility intentions among Canadian university students
AN  - 1373427769; 201331018
AB  - Little is known about how environmental concern in young adulthood may shape childbearing attitudes and intentions. Here, we examine the relationship between individual environmental concern, fertility intentions, and attitudes toward reproduction in a sample of Canadian university students, N = 139. General environmental concern and pollution-related health concerns both predicted a less positive attitude toward having children. Further, attitude toward having children mediated the negative relationship between pollution-related health concerns and personal fertility intentions. This study offers an important early step in empirical examination of the association between environmental concern and fertility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity, Gender Socialization, and Children's Attitudes Toward Gay Men and Lesbian Women
AN  - 1125223607; 201240567
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess whether children's attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women differ in relation to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11.47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50.2% had non-Western and 49.8% Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender.

T1  - Relationship closeness and control as determinants of pleasant amae
AN  - 1283639488; 201303185
AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Making Philadelphia Safe for "WFIL-adelphia": Television, Housing, and Defensive Localism in Postwar Philadelphia
AN  - 1924176956
AB  - This article examines television and housing as sites of struggle over segregation in postwar Philadelphia. WFIL-TV, which was part of Walter Annenberg's media empire, broadcast to a four state region it called "WFIL-adelphia," and emphasized the station's ability to help advertisers reach millions of these regional consumers in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. At the same time, however, the racial tensions around WFIL's West Philadelphia studio threatened to scare off advertisers. Just steps from the station's front door, for example, black families seeking to move into West Philadelphia faced organized resistance from white homeowners associations. Scared of offending local and regional viewers and advertisers, WFIL implemented racial discriminatory admissions policies in its most popular show, the teenage dance program Bandstand (which became American Bandstand ). I argue that, in working to maintain segregated spaces, both WFIL-TV and white homeowners associations practiced overlapping and reinforcing versions of defensive localism.

T1  - People's perceptions of HIV/AIDS as portrayed by their labels of the disease: the case of Botswana
TT  - Les perceptions que les gens ont du VIH/Sida, telles que décrites par les étiquettes qu'ils collent sur la maladie: le cas du Botswana
AN  - 1971745130
AB  - It is typical of societies to come up with their own labels or names to any phenomenon that may befall them in the course of their life time. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been no exception to this practice. In Botswana most of these labels are either in Setswana or English whereby an Eglish expression is simply adopted and used to refer to HIV/ AIDS. This study looks at the different labels or names that have been used to refer to HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It is an attempt to provide insights into perceptions of HIV/AIDS by the local communities portrayed through the naming of this disease. The study demonstrates how, through the different labels, the local communities started in denial distancing themselves from this disease and in some cases associating AIDS with ailments already known to them, cultural practices and taboos. Some of these labels further demonstrate the negative attitudes that may have fuelled HIV-related stigma in the country. Based on the informants' responses, the paper further attempts a categorisation of these labels influenced by different attitudes to HIV/AIDS, some of which are self-perpetuating and may continue to be a hindrance to the fight against the disease.

T1  - CONSEQUENCES OF BLACK EXCEPTIONALISM? Interracial Unions with Blacks, Depressive Symptoms, and Relationship Satisfaction
AN  - 885086678
AB  - Using data from Wave 4 (2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 7,466), we examine potential consequences of black exceptionalism in the context of interracial relationships among nonblack respondents. While increasing racial diversity and climbing rates of interracial unions have fostered the notion that racial boundaries within the United States are fading, our results add to the accumulating evidence that racial/ethnic boundaries persist in U.S. society. Results suggest that among non-Black respondents there is more stigma and disapproval attached to relationships with Blacks than there are to relationships with members of other racial/ethnic groups. Specifically, our results indicate that nonblack individuals with black partners have significantly more depressive symptoms and less relationship satisfaction than their counterparts with nonblack partners, regardless of respondent race and whether the nonblack partner is the same versus a different race from the respondent. Further, the relationship between partner race and depressive symptoms is partially and significantly mediated by relationship satisfaction. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "I Depend on You, You Depend on Me. Shouldn't We Agree?": The Influence of Interdependent Relationships on Individuals' Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1030867135; 201227846
AB  - Two studies examined the extent to which individuals' racial attitudes are influenced more by interdependent others' attitudes than people with whom they do not mutually depend. Study 1 demonstrated that participants significantly changed their racial attitudes when they received disagreement feedback from an ingroup friend, whereas there was no change in attitudes when participants received disagreement feedback from an ingroup stranger, agreement feedback, or no feedback. Furthermore, feelings of interdependence mediated the relationship between feedback from a friend versus stranger and changes in racial attitudes. In Study 2, we manipulated interdependence and found that interdependent partners altered their racial attitudes after receiving disagreement information, whereas independent partners did not. The importance of interdependent others' attitudes in reducing prejudice is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Environmental Determinants of Racial Attitudes Redux: The Critical Decisions Related to Operationalizing Context
AN  - 896165072; 201120189
AB  - Although scholars have long been interested in how context shapes racial attitudes, research in this area has fallen short of a consensus. Instead, the results span a wide range, with some studies finding that racial understanding is promoted by intergroup contact whereas others claim that racial and ethnic outgroups are perceived as a threat to economic and political interests. These varying results arise from research rooted in different conceptualizations of context. Our analysis is unique in the attention we pay to the measure of context for our particular data set. Employing a sociodemographic definition of neighborhood social context, we find that contextual socioeconomic status plays a critical role in mediating the effects of intergroup contact on racial attitudes. These contacts are more likely to produce racial harmony in high-status neighborhoods than in neighborhoods marked by low income and low levels of education.

T1  - Can the Web Be Made Accessible for People with Intellectual Disabilities?
AN  - 2130304242
AB  - This article presents the findings of a research project that aimed to contribute to the social inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities (ID) in the World Wide Web (the Web). The Inclusive New Media Design (INMD) project brought together thirty-one Web designers and developers with twenty-nine people with intellectual disabilities to explore the best practice for building Web sites accessible to the ID community. Specifically, the project took accessibility techniques identified in ID accessibility research, and investigated what would (or would not) make it possible for Web professionals to implement them. This article suggests some tentative answers to the question of whether a fully accessible Web can be built, one that includes people with ID. While the article outlines simple steps that can be taken to facilitate accessibility for people at the mild end of the ID spectrum, it also highlights a number of barriers that exist to implementing ID accessibility guidance, most notably the power holders and decision makers with whom Web designers work, who may not share the designers' commitment to accessibility.

T1  - Examining the Attitude-Behavior Relationship in Prosocial Donation Domains
AN  - 1866473544
AB  - Positive attitudes have been identified across prosocial donation domains, but have not translated into a stable donor base. One explanation for this attitude-behavior inconsistency is a failure to consider the affective and cognitive components of attitude. Studies were conducted to examine vested interest as a moderator of the attitude-behavior relationship in donation, while accounting for the multidimensional construction of attitude. Study 1 revealed a 3-factor structure (stake, salience, self-efficacy) for vested interest. Study 2 found no support for vested interest as a moderator of the attitude-behavior relationship, but revealed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between attitudes and behaviors for organ/tissue and blood donation. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of this research in crafting donation campaigns.

T1  - New allies for immigration reform: A Cincinnati story
AN  - 222628374
AB  - Butler County, just north of Cincinnati and part of the metro area, has attracted attention in recent years because of its flamboyant sheriff, who has taken it upon himself and his police department to round up undocumented immigrants and enforce vague and outdated federal immigration policies.  With her young daughter at her side, she said that she had wanted to obtain a visa and enter the country legally but that she did not have the money or property required to get a visa.\n Since moving to Cincinnati in March, I had also been involved in a car accident with an uninsured, unlicensed immigrant driver, and I identified with her desire not to get the person in trouble.

T1  - Community empowerment
AN  - 203702766
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine Communities First, an area-based regeneration policy in Wales to explore the barriers to community empowerment. Three related research projects provide data to inform the discussion of community empowerment and to consider the implications of delivery of the policy for theorising the relationship between the citizen and the state as mediated through regeneration partnerships.  Data from three related research projects are discussed. These are an evaluation of local delivery of the Communities First programme, the delivery of technical support to participating communities and a Joseph Rowntree-funded case study of nine regeneration partnerships. All projects are concerned with exploring the experience of community members within regeneration partnerships. The findings identify major barriers to the achievement of community empowerment including issues of community capacity, institutional capacity, organisational cultures and regulatory frameworks. The findings identify mechanisms for improving community participation and empowerment. The findings are also used to identify community actor agency within regeneration partnerships and to argue against an analysis of regeneration initiatives as a mechanism of social control and incorporation of community activism into a state led agenda. The paper explores one specific policy within a UK devolved region and is not able to comment extensively on similar policy programmes in other areas of the UK. However, it uses this specific experience to comment on generic issues in the community empowerment field and to elaborate theory on the relationship between the citizen and the state. The paper offers practitioners and policy makers insight into the community experience of participation in regeneration partnerships and proposes methods and policy refinements which can improve empowerment outcomes and assist community participation to achieve higher levels of influence over statutory partners. While the paper identifies barriers to empowerment that are recognised in the wider literature, it demonstrates that such barriers can prevail even within a highly participative policy framework such as Communities First. The paper also provides evidence of a clear sense of agency on the part of community members of regeneration partnerships and counters models which suggest regeneration partnerships are simple mechanisms of social control which diffuse community activism.
