T1  - An Eye for an Eye? An Integrated Model of Attitude Change Toward Protest Violence
AN  - 2696809127
AB  - How political violence emerges, why people support it, and how authorities can address it without escalating further radicalization remain an ongoing debate. In this study, we develop a quantitative model to predict violence endorsement as a function of repression severity, group identification, and individual emotions. We situate our investigation in the context of the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong, during which the public acceptance of violence increased substantially, contrasting the city’s long history of peaceful protests. Results show that violence endorsement is associated with repression severity in a U-shaped fashion. While limited repression deters violence endorsement, excessive repression crossing a proportionality threshold escalates it. Group identification is a salient moderator that amplifies the backfire effects of repression. People who are more attached to protesting groups are more vigilant about repression and more supportive of protest violence. Furthermore, we also find that individual emotions exert more significant influences than repression and group identification. Anger, disgust, and fear can result in radicalized opinions. These findings unpack the complex and multifaceted communicative processes that shape the perceptions of protest violence. In contrast to the rational, organizational, and structural models of social movements, we argue that this analytical framework can offer more insights into protest dynamics amid the increasingly personalized political participation.

T1  - Older adults’ experiences of social distancing and the role of the community center during COVID-19
AN  - 2680176424
AB  - Purpose>Although very much needed from an infection control perspective, there is deep concern about the impact of social distancing during COVID-19, particularly on older adults.Design/methodology/approach>A phenomenological design was used to gain insight into older adults’ experiences of living with social distancing during the first wave of COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight older adults.Findings>Six themes were identified: a smaller life, feelings of unease, resilience, connection to the community centre, technology: a boon, but one with limitations, and the way through social distancing.Originality/value>This study captures older adults’ experiences early in COVID-19. Findings indicate that there is much we can learn from these older adults regarding social isolation that could apply to other older adults and potentially other age groups during the time of pandemic and beyond.

T1  - Age Identity and Social Exclusion of Older Persons: A Psychosocial Perspective
AN  - 2663836063
AB  - The psychosocial model of social exclusion postulates that age identity of older persons induce and sustain perceived and enacted discrimination, resulting in psychosocial disability and social exclusion. These propositions were tested by using a cross-sectional survey of 573 older persons, aged 65 years and above. The variables were measured by standardized rating scales. The results reveal age identity significantly influenced perceived (β = .762; p < .001), enacted discrimination (β = .514; p < .001), psychosocial disability (β = .588; p < .001) and social exclusion (β = .389; p < .001). Perceived discrimination significantly increased enacted discrimination (β = .314; p < .001) and enacted discrimination influenced psychosocial disability (β = .279; p < .001) and psychosocial disability increased social exclusion (β = .090; p < .05). Perceived discrimination significantly mediated the negative effect of age identity on enacted discrimination (b = .211; p < .001), psychosocial disability (b = .219; p < .001) and social exclusion (b = .073; p < .05). The conceptual model showed good data model-fit, giving evidence to conclude that this model was useful in explaining process and outcomes of social exclusion of older persons.

T1  - Social dominance orientation, right‐wing authoritarianism, and political attitudes toward governmental performance during the COVID‐19 pandemic
AN  - 2650002132
AB  - This research examined the association of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right‐wing authoritarianism (RWA) with the evaluations of the government's anti‐coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) policies and performance. In Study 1 (N = 261), we found that SDO and RWA were positively associated with resistance to criticism about the government's anti‐COVID‐19 measures. In addition, SDO was positively associated with favorable evaluations of the government's performance in handling the crisis. Support for lockdown policies mediated these attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 438), the results show that SDO and RWA had indirect associations with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system through three mediation variables. Evaluations of the US government's performance in handling the COVID‐19 pandemic were negatively associated with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system, and there was a negative relationship between evaluations of the Chinese and US governments’ performances.

T1  - How Human-like Behavior of Service Robot Affects Social Distance: A Mediation Model and Cross-Cultural Comparison
AN  - 2693885182
AB  - Previous studies on the human likeness of service robots have focused mainly on their human-like appearance and used psychological constructs to measure the outcomes of human likeness. Unlike previous studies, this study focused on the human-like behavior of the service robot and used a sociological construct, social distance, to measure the outcome of human likeness. We constructed a conceptual model, with perceived competence and warmth as mediators, based on social-identity theory. The hypotheses were tested through online experiments with 219 participants from China and 180 participants from the US. Similar results emerged for Chinese and American participants in that the high (vs. low) human-like behavior of the service robot caused the participants to have stronger perceptions of competence and warmth, both of which contributed to a smaller social distance between humans and service robots. Perceptions of competence and warmth completely mediated the positive effect of the human-like behavior of the service robot on social distance. Furthermore, Chinese participants showed higher anthropomorphism (perceived human-like behavior) and a stronger perception of warmth and smaller social distance. The perception of competence did not differ across cultures. This study provides suggestions for the human-likeness design of service robots to promote natural interaction between humans and service robots and increase human acceptance of service robots.

T1  - Discourse, Difference, and Divergence: Exploring Media Representations and Online Public Sentiments toward Marginalized Urban Communities in Jamaica during the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2679830273
AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston’s poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the ‘threatening other’. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

T1  - The future of buyer–seller interactions: a conceptual framework and research agenda
AN  - 2619339889
AB  - The revolution in information availability and the advances in novel interaction technologies have ushered in two major shifts that call into question the traditional assumptions of buyer–seller interactions. First, buyer–seller information asymmetry has greatly decreased in many interactions. Second, face-to-face communication is no longer the main format of buyer–seller interactions. In this article, the authors review empirical research on how these shifts have changed buyer–seller negotiations, an important type of buyer–seller interactions. Several insights arise from this review. First, the shifts have caused fundamental changes in buyers’ and sellers’ roles, power, and aspirations and information processing. Second, the shifts and these fundamental changes together cause major changes in buyer–seller interactional processes and outcomes, including (1) change in buyers’ attitude and behavior, (2) change in sellers’ effectiveness in interacting with buyers, and (3) change in buyer–seller interactional processes. Based on these insights, the authors develop a research agenda to guide the reexamination of existing theories and the development of new theories of buyer–seller interactions.

T1  - Unattached and unconvinced: Australian non‐partisans
AN  - 2605007214
AB  - Political party identification is a strong predictor of political behaviour and social attitudes in advanced industrialised democracies. Australian Election Study data show declining identification with major parties over time, and that working‐class Australians, those who do not identify with any class, the secular and the politically uninterested are most likely to be non‐partisans. However, national samples rarely allow for detailed analysis of younger people, given the low numbers of younger people they contain. Longitudinal data from the Social Futures and Life Pathways (“Our Lives”) project enable us to focus upon young Australians aged 24 living in the state of Queensland. The Queensland data show that younger non‐partisans tend to lack post‐secondary education, are on lower incomes, are less interested in politics and, importantly, have non‐aligned parents. Nationally, non‐partisans were less likely than partisans to pay attention to politics during the 2016 Federal Election, but more likely to decide how to vote on the day of the Federal Election and more likely than partisans to vote informal. Younger non‐partisans were also less likely to engage in non‐electoral political actions, such as signing e‐petitions or posting in online forums or social networking sites.

T1  - Do Belonging and Social Exclusion at School Affect Structural Brain Development During Adolescence?
AN  - 2597982816
AB  - Students’ sense of belonging presents an essential resource for academic and health outcomes, whereas social exclusion at school negatively impacts students’ well‐being and academic performance. Aiming to understand how feelings of school‐related belonging and exclusion shape the structural brain development, this study applied longitudinal questionnaire‐based data and MRI data from 71 adolescent students (37 females, Mage at t1 = 15.0; t2 = 16.1 years). All were white participants from Germany. Voxel‐based morphometry revealed only an association of social exclusion (and not of belonging) and gray matter volume in the left anterior insula: From t1 to t2, there was less gray matter decrease, the more social exclusion students perceived. School‐related social exclusion and disturbed neurodevelopment are thus significantly associated.

T1  - How millennials’ life concerns shape social media behaviour
AN  - 2595303806
AB  - Two characteristics of millennial behaviour motivate the present study – an increasing concern for various life issues, and an increasing level of social media usage. In the present study, we focused on millennials’ societal concerns, financial concerns and social exclusion concerns and examined how these concerns influence social media behaviour. Adopting the compensatory consumer behaviour framework, we proposed that millennials’ social media behaviour can be understood as a form of compensatory consumption, that is, a coping mechanism for dealing with major life concerns. Data collected from a commercial survey of Australian millennials supported most of our hypotheses. We observed that social exclusion concerns directly influenced social media behaviour, whereas societal and financial concerns influence social media behaviour indirectly through influencing social exclusion concerns. Our proposed model explained more than half of the variance in social exclusion concerns, and more than one-third of the variance in social media behaviour.

T1  - Digital and Physical Social Exclusion of Older People in Rural Nigeria in the Time of COVID-19
AN  - 2550962393
AB  - As the use of digital technology becomes more widespread across the globe, older people remain among the group with the lowest access and usage. The digital divide may lead to double exclusion as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to limited physical social contact as experts’ recommendation of continuous social distancing and lack of access and usage of internet communication will leave older people socially isolated. The aim of this study is to explore how older people in rural Nigeria may be digitally excluded and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was obtained from 11 older people using interviews. The collected data was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings show that older people in rural Nigeria were digitally excluded. However, the older people argued that the digital exclusion is not the reason for their social isolation and loneliness. The study concluded by suggesting how caregivers and social workers can assist rural older people through activity schedule and radio programs designed for older people.

T1  - A matter of taste: Gustatory sensitivity predicts political ideology
AN  - 2582436336
AB  - Previous research has shown that political attitudes are highly heritable, but the proximal physiological mechanisms that shape ideology remain largely unknown. Based on work suggesting possible ideological differences in genes related to low-level sensory processing, we predicted that taste (i.e., gustatory) sensitivity would be associated with political ideology. In 4 studies (combined N = 1,639) we test this hypothesis and find robust support for this association. In Studies 1–3, we find that sensitivity to the chemicals PROP and PTC-2 well established measures of taste sensitivity-are associated with greater political conservatism. In Study 4, we find that fungiform papilla density, a proxy for taste bud density, also predicts greater conservatism, and that this association is partially statistically mediated by disgust sensitivity. This work suggests that low-level physiological differences in sensory processing may shape an individual's political attitudes.

T1  - Three clusters of content-audience associations in expression of racial prejudice while consuming online television news
AN  - 2554597182
AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an “online television” service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns.

T1  - What Predicts Selective Exposure Online: Testing Political Attitudes, Credibility, and Social Identity
AN  - 2540700015
AB  - The online environment offers nearly unlimited sources and information, giving people unprecedented agency over selection. This article offers a test of three factors predicting selective exposure to opinionated news online—prior political attitudes, source credibility, and individual social identity based on race (Study 1) and gender (Study 2)—testing their independent and interactive effects. Two original selection studies on samples of adult Americans offered articles that were (1) pro- or counter-attitudinal with regard to individual attitudes on two political issues, (2) from high- versus low-credibility sources conceptualized in two different ways, and (3) featuring participants’ social in-group or out-group. Unobtrusively logged behavioral selection data suggest that prior political attitudes, and their strength and importance in Study 1, more strongly predict pro-attitudinal exposure than both source credibility and the demographically based social identity. Both studies additionally reveal nuanced interactions between the tested factors.

T1  - (De)humanization and (dis)trust: Representations of Muslims in the UK newspapers following the 7/7 London bombings
AN  - 2547612300
AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust.

T1  - The Dawkins effect? Celebrity scientists, (non)religious publics and changed attitudes to evolution
AN  - 2524197741
AB  - The role of science popularization remains relatively under-explored in research on contemporary public acceptance of evolution. In this study, we analyse national survey data to interrogate the role Britain’s best-known celebrity scientists David Attenborough, Brian Cox, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Hawking may have played in changing public views of evolution, as well as the role of two creationists: Ken Ham and Harun Yahya. We investigate how well known these public figures are, what their views of religion are perceived to be and, drawing on social identity theory, whether they exert different effects on attitudinal change to evolution among different religious and non-religious publics. Binary logistic regression analysis shows that among Muslim and Pentecostal Christian publics, those familiar with Dawkins as both a scientist and as someone who holds negative views of religion are more likely to have become less accepting of evolution. Conversely, among non-religious publics, Dawkins was the only celebrity scientist associated with higher odds of becoming more accepting of evolution. We suggest that engaging certain religious audiences with the science of evolutionary biology may be more effective when their religious identities are not threatened.

T1  - Asynchrony Between Individual and Government Actions Accounts for Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Communities
AN  - 2503454703
AB  - Introduction Previously estimated effects of social distancing do not account for changes in individual behavior before the implementation of stay-at-home policies or model this behavior in relation to the burden of disease. This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. Methods This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in April‒July 2020. Results Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3−8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12−19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8−17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. Conclusions This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.

T1  - Public attitudes concerning Intra-EU immigration in Germany: The role of government and press
AN  - 2570350314
AB  - Prejudice and negative attitudes concerning immigration is an omnipresent phenomenon in many modern societies around the world. This study has investigated the relationship between Germans’ trust in their government and the press and its association with their attitudes concerning the immigration of people from other EU member states. This study is first of its kind that has investigated the public attitudes concerning Intra-EU Immigration. On the one hand, the results of the study have identified two determinants of people’s attitudes concerning immigration. On the other hand, it has reconfirmed the overall positive attitudes of Germans concerning immigration. The findings are consistent with the observation that distrust of the press and government seems to be a strong characteristic of those with negative views of immigrants and immigration. The study provides essential insights that should be taken into consideration in future immigration studies.

T1  - Elite stigmatization of the unemployed: The association between framing and public attitudes
AN  - 2495956832
AB  - This paper uses a multi‐methods approach to explore the social psychological construction of stigma towards the unemployed. Study 1a uses thematic analysis to explore frames used by political elites in speeches at U.K. national party conferences between 1996 and 2016 (n = 43); in study 1b, we track the usage of these frames in six national newspapers (n = 167,723 articles) over the same period showing an increase in the use of negative frames. Study 1c shows that these are associated with national attitudes towards welfare recipients using the British Social Attitude Survey. We find the ‘Othering’ frame is correlated with negative attitudes towards the unemployed, even when controlling for the unemployment rate. This finding supports the claim that social attitudes are related to frames produced in the political and media spheres. We provide theoretical integration between social representations theory and framing which affords development in both domains.

T1  - Social Exclusion and Impulsive Buying among Chinese College Students: The Mediating Role of Self-Esteem and the Moderating Role of Risk Preference
AN  - 2596020342
AB  - With the development of science and technology, buying has become much easier. At the same time, however, impulsive buying has many negative consequences for college students, such as dissatisfaction and debt; the causes of impulsive buying should, therefore, be explored urgently. There are numerous empirical studies indicating that social exclusion may be a potential factor of impulsive buying, and the underlying mechanisms of this association remain unclear. In this study, we used the Social Exclusion Scale, Self-Esteem Scale, Risk Preference Scale, and Impulsive Buying Scale, as well as a cross-sectional design to investigate the roles of self-esteem and risk preference in the relationship between social exclusion and impulsive buying among 768 college students (387 were female, Mage = 20.25 years). The results were as follows: (1) when controlling for gender, age, family monthly income, and monthly living expenses, social exclusion significantly and positively predicted impulsive buying; (2) self-esteem played a mediating role between social exclusion and impulsive buying; (3) risk preference moderated the relationship between the second half of the mediating path and the direct path. These results reveal the mechanism underlying impulsive buying in college students, that is, social exclusion will predict the decrease in college students’ self-esteem, and low self-esteem will further predict college students’ impulsive buying, which is a way for them to gain a sense of self-worth. Relatively low risk preference can well alleviate the negative impact of social exclusion and low self-esteem on impulsive buying. What is more, these results have implications for impulsive buying interventions and preventions. Schools should aim to create a good peer atmosphere by implementing certain rules that help to reduce social exclusion, and parents and education departments should cultivate students’ risk awareness to avoid risk behaviors in college students, such as impulsive buying behavior. This study fills the research gap regarding college students’ impulsive buying and explores its internal psychological mechanism.

T1  - Does Intercultural Contact Increase Anti-Racist Behavior on Social Network Sites?
AN  - 2544936062
AB  - Empirical attention on online intercultural contact and prejudice reduction are increasing. Nevertheless, still little is known on processes that could influence the contact–prejudice relation as well as the relation between online contact and anti-racist behavior. Based on literature on intergroup contact, the present study aims to fill these gaps, focusing on online intergroup relationships between people from different countries. Specifically, it examines whether and to what extent empathic feelings and online community commitment mediate the relationship between online intergroup contact and both perceived ethnic discrimination and anti-racist behavior on Facebook. We collected data from a predominantly Italian sample of 1018 Facebook users (Mage = 30.03, SDage = 11.09; females: 80.01%); participants filled in an online questionnaire. A semi-full Structural Equation Modeling was used to test hypotheses. The results confirmed that when intergroup contact was established, such contact was able to increase the sense of being committed to the online community, which increased the perception of online discrimination towards ethnic and racial minorities, which in turn was able to increase the anti-racist behavior. The ambivalent role of the empathy in online contexts will be discussed.

T1  - Advocacy, Hesitancy, and Equity: Exploring U.S. Race-Related Discussions of the COVID-19 Vaccine on Twitter
AN  - 2539743755
AB  - Background: Our study aimed to describe themes of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, race, and ethnicity to explore the context of the intersection of these topics on Twitter. Methods: We utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect a random 1% sample of publicly available tweets from October 2020 to January 2021. The study team conducted a qualitative content analysis from the full data set of 1110 tweets. Results: The tweets revealed vaccine support through vaccine affirmation, advocacy through reproach, a need for a vaccine, COVID-19 and racism, vaccine development and efficacy, racist vaccine humor, and news updates. Vaccine opposition was demonstrated through direct opposition, vaccine hesitancy, and adverse reactions. Conspiracy and misinformation included scientific misinformation, political misinformation, beliefs about immunity and protective behaviors, and race extermination conspiracy. Equity and access focused on overcoming history of medical racism, pointing out health disparities, and facilitators to vaccine access. Representation touted pride in development and role models, and politics discussed the role of politics in vaccines and international politics. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that Twitter can provide nuances about multiple viewpoints on the vaccine related to race and ethnicity and can be beneficial in contributing to insights for public health messaging.

T1  - Otherness as a form of intersubjective social exclusion: Conceptual discussion from the current communicative scenario
AN  - 2533647852
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to review the theory based on «otherness» as a form of social exclusion and symbolic violence from the constructions of realities of the media, with particular emphasis on the ethics and aesthetics of language and its role in materializing identity differences.Design/methodology/approachA search for specific criteria and boolean algorithms is carried out in Web of Science and Scopus on «otherness» [AND] «social exclusion», to then submit the emerging results to a co-occurrence matrix by citations with VOSViewer v. 1.6.13. From the relation tree of the most cited documents [min = 7] of the downloaded articles, a critical/analytical reading is made.Findings«Otherness» is reviewed to a greater extent from a Western perspective, and more specifically, from a Eurocentric one. This implies that the study of «otherness» is not sufficiently analyzed by Asian or African authors, who are excluded from the analysis. In this sense, «otherness» is understood as a theoretical construct and as any symbolic construction of the other (phenotypically, but also in ideology, values and customs), but which carries a load of stereotypes that can become polarization, demonization, ergo and violence.Originality/valueRevisiting «otherness» as an informative construct becomes imperative in light of the emergence of extremist groups and xenophobic parties, as well as separatist policies such as Brexit or the Catalan split in Spain. Few articles contribute to elaborating a complete conceptual construct on «otherness» as an epistemological category of communication and information, so this research effort attempts to compile its theoretical discussion.

T1  - I (dis)like the way you (dis)like them: The role of extended contact on social distance and attitudes towards the ingroup
AN  - 2474519535
AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis.

T1  - Social Representations of Sociopolitical Groups on r/The_Donald and Emergent Conflict Narratives: A Qualitative Content Analysis 
AN  - 2472327721
AB  - Social media has been integral for the organization and success of right‐wing populist movements in the United States and Europe. Within online communities, discussions take place in which ideologies are formulated, iterated upon, and disseminated. One particular forum, hosted on the popular website reddit.com, r/The_Donald, has received media attention for its political influence. Despite the influence of online spaces in populist, far‐right movements, relatively little attention has been paid to qualitative content of discussions that take place within such spaces, including r/The_Donald. Guided by a social representations approach, we analyzed how discussions on r/The_Donald represent sociopolitical groups. We focused on discussions of political affiliations, race relations, immigration, and culture. From a dataset of 8,198 posts, we selected 1,292 segments from 883 unique Reddit usernames and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the majority of posts discussed liberals, race relations, and conspiracy theories, and in these posts, liberals and liberal ideas were delegitimized and mocked through their representations. These posts represented conservatives through antinomic contrast and comparison to liberals and liberal policies. The meanings of those representations in intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Exploring a pathway to radicalization: The effects of social exclusion and rejection sensitivity: GPIR
AN  - 2466740067
AB  - This article aims to explore if social exclusion can constitute a pathway to radicalization, and if individual level of sensitivity of rejection moderates the effect of social exclusion. Humans innately seek belonging and meaning, and strive for re-establishing a sense of value and belongingness if faced with social exclusion. One way to achieve this is by adherence to a new and inviting group. In four studies, we test to what extent individuals who face social exclusion adapt to a radical including group. In Studies 1 (n = 104) and 2 (n = 308), we use a social media-like paradigm to manipulate social exclusion. In Study 3 (n = 1041), we use the so-called Cyberball paradigm, and in Study 4 (n = 40) we use a real-life manipulation. All studies show that rejected individuals who are sensitive to rejection are more prone to identify with, engage with and endorse an extreme group. The results hold over both ideological (Studies 1–3) and non-ideological (Study 4) content. Only the last study showed a main effect of social exclusion. We discuss the results in reference to the significance loss model of radicalization.

T1  - Rural old-age social exclusion: a conceptual framework on mediators of exclusion across the lifecourse
AN  - 2449109724
AB  - Social exclusion amongst rural-dwelling older adults and the role of the diversity of people and places in mediating the construction of that exclusion has not been adequately investigated or conceptualised in the international literature. Consequently, how ageing in a rural community can function to disadvantage or protect older people remains poorly understood. With the aim of advancing conceptual understanding on rural old-age social exclusion, this article explores how exclusion is manifest in the lifecourse experiences of rural-dwelling older adults and the role of mediating factors in the construction of exclusion in different kinds of rural places. The analysis draws on ten rural case-study sites across Ireland and Northern Ireland, encompassing five kinds of rural communities: dispersed rural; remote rural; island rural; village rural; and near-urban rural. Data come from 106 interviews with older people ranging in age from 59 to 93 years. Rural old-age social exclusion is confirmed as a multi-dimensional construct, involving: social relations; service infrastructure; transport and mobility; safety, security and crime; and financial and material resources. This analysis demonstrates that social exclusion for rural-dwelling older people is multi-layered, and its prevalence and form is shaped by four mediating factors: individual capacities; lifecourse trajectories; place; and macro-economic forces. The findings are used to present a conceptual framework that emphasises the role of mediating forces on rural old-age social exclusion.

T1  - Political correctness and the alt-right: The development of extreme political attitudes
AN  - 2449154186
AB  - Recent studies have documented a shift from moderate political attitudes to more extreme attitudes at the ends of the political spectrum. This can be seen in Political Correctness (PC) on the left, and white identitarian (WI) attitudes on the ‘Alt-Right’ (AR). While highly covered in mainstream media, limited academic research has investigated their possible antecedents and psychological correlates. The current study investigated the prevalence and psychological predictors of these attitudes. Utilising a quota-based sample of 512 U.S. participants, we found that extreme political attitudes were associated with various personality traits, social media use, and upbringing. PC attitudes were associated with agreeableness, black-white thinking, social-media use, and perceived overprotective parenting. WI attitudes were associated with low agreeableness and openness, and high black-white thinking. Our results show that extreme left and right attitudes are separated by individual differences, and that authoritarianism can be seen on both the left and the right.

T1  - Discrimination, Skin Color Satisfaction, and Adjustment among Latinx American Youth
AN  - 2441386630
AB  - Race-related biases and discrimination and easily observable race-related characteristics, such as skin color, appear to go hand and hand, but it remains unclear how these factors work together to shape youth development. The current study addresses this gap by investigating skin color satisfaction as a mediator between perceptions of discrimination and adjustment. Data are from a cross-sectional sample of Latinx youth (N = 175; Mage = 12.86; 51.4% female; 86.9% US-born) who completed measures of foreigner-based objectification, peer discrimination, adult discrimination, self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and the importance or value attributed to academic success. Evidence of significant indirect effects of skin color satisfaction in the links between foreigner-based objectification and self-esteem as well as academic importance was found. Skin color satisfaction did not mediate links between either peer or adult discrimination and self-esteem, depression, and academic importance. The results provide support that being perceived as a foreigner has negative implications for Latinx youth adjustment through skin color satisfaction. The present study expands understanding of how different forms of differential treatment may affect minoritized youth. Implications and future research ideas are discussed.

T1  - Relative deprivation, social exclusion, and quality of life among Chinese internal migrants
AN  - 2461614526
AB  - Objectives Factors contributing to diminishing quality of life (QOL) of migrants have been examined, but little is known about the impact of relative deprivation. This study aimed to clarify the effects of relative deprivation on QOL and mediating effects of social exclusion among Chinese internal migrants. Study design This is a secondary data analysis of a nationally representative survey. Methods We obtained data from 14,816 internal immigrants, aged 15–59 years, throughout China using the 2014 China Migrants Dynamic Survey (CMDS). We measured relative deprivation via a modified Yitzhaki Index, social exclusion using a four-point Likert scale, and QOL using the Kessler Psychological Distress Short Scale, the Satisfaction with Life Scale, and a subscale of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey. Survey data of 15,996 local residents were also retrieved and analyzed to make possible comparisons between the local and migrant population. Furthermore, we used descriptive and statistical analyses with data from the CMDS to identify relative deprivation and social exclusion. Results The results show relative deprivation both directly and indirectly influences Chinese internal migrants' QOL. Specifically, compared with the local population, relative deprivation triggers serious social exclusion (β = 0.008, P < 0.001), ultimately deteriorating QOL. Social exclusion partially mediated the total effects of relative deprivation on mental illness (β = 0.004, P < 0.001), self-rated health (β = −0.285, P < 0.001), and life satisfaction (β = −0.020, P < 0.001) among Chinese internal migrants. Conclusion Relative deprivation significantly impacts QOL by exacerbating mental illness, eroding self-rated health, and inhibiting life satisfaction. Relative deprivation is significantly directly associated with various indicators of QOL and indirectly affects QOL through social exclusion. In addition, our results demonstrate that the relative deprivation theoretical approach and the modified Yitzhaki Index are worthy of future investigation in studies of migrants' health.

T1  - Understanding Social Exclusion through Minimum Income Recipients’ Living Conditions: Proposals for a New Institutional Social Inclusion Strategy: Proposals for a new institutional social inclusion strategy
AN  - 2451163593
AB  - There is a long academic and institutional trajectory that understands social exclusion as an accumulation of barriers that hinder social participation. However, stereotypes about misuse and dependency on social benefits continue to be widespread in society. Fighting poverty is the first objective of sustainable development and the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Commitment is needed from institutions to disseminate real information about people living in exclusion. This study of the living conditions of Minimum Income recipients in Navarre (Spain) shows that households that stay longer in the scheme encounter serious obstacles accessing employment, including unrecognized physical and mental illnesses, are required to care for dependents, or have weak job skills. The related study was conducted through a database analysis of 14,000 benefit recipients and in-depth interviews with 20 recipients. The results show that inclusion through work continues to play a central role in the fight against social exclusion. However, this remains a difficult goal to achieve for many recipients, and employment does not always guarantee social inclusion due to harsh conditions and low salaries. This article recognizes the inclusive potential of economic benefits, since they prevent the deterioration of living conditions and favor social participation. Finally, it suggests a new institutional strategy based on two activities: designing inclusion-based activities around the real needs of poor people, and promoting the commitment of all actors and agents in society in the fight against poverty.

T1  - The impact of social stratification on morbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic
TT  - Impact of social stratification on morbidity
AN  - 2465952208
AB  - PurposeSocioeconomic status (SES) has been known to be associated with many aspects of social life such as health. We argue that social stratification remains relevant in understanding differentials in health during a pandemic, as countries globally have encouraged or enforced social distancing and remote work measures.Design/methodology/approachBy examining data sources and news reports on the COVID-19 pandemic, we aim to highlight the relationship between SES and morbidity, through the ability to adopt social distancing measures and work remotely. Utilizing publicly available data from the Maryland Transport Institute and the US Census, we performed linear regressions on median income, social distancing index and percentage of individuals working from home.FindingsIndividuals with higher SES are more likely to have jobs that provide opportunities for remote work to be performed, which allows for social distancing. Comparatively, individuals with lower SES are more likely to be involved in jobs that cannot be performed remotely. The linear regression models suggest a positive moderate and significant correlation between median income and social distancing index (R2 = 0.4981, p-value < 0.001), and a positive weak and significant correlation between median income and remote work (R2 = 0.2460, p-value < 0.001).Research limitations/implicationsGovernments need to account for SES in policymaking to reduce inequalities in health.Originality/valueThe paper aims to improve the understanding of social stratification and morbidity through examining data on the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - The Biopolitics of Social Distancing
AN  - 2447804032
AB  - As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, new technologies are being leveraged to enforce social distancing requirements. I explore social distancing through the theoretical lens of Michel Foucault’s biopolitics, with an emphasis on recognizing unauthorized movement and controlling circulation. Although reporting and widely shared data visualizations about COVID-19 have made many people newly aware that their movements are being tracked and surveilled, governments are already implementing new measures such as geofencing and artificial intelligence (AI)–based facial recognition to facilitate the enforcement of social distancing. The tracking of COVID-19 spread and social distancing behaviors of the public has made more visible the practices of biopolitics but also generated new opportunities for even greater surveillance and control. The current moment offers an opportunity to shift public perceptions about data surveillance, technological control, and the racial disparities of biopower, much in the same way that public perceptions around social media shifted during and after the Arab Spring. How we collectively respond to these biopolitical processes will, in part, determine how such power relations are articulated in the future.

T1  - <i>Big Questions in Microhistory</i>
AN  - 2419140395
AB  - Attesting to the truth of Magnusson's comment, all three works hinge on celebrated murder or kidnapping trials where there are transcripts, police records, and lots of newspaper coverage.

The most exciting moments arrive when the ordinary lives of their protagonists come into view.

Since so much of the everyday lives of so many has been hidden for so long, finally seeing it explored and explained is remarkably refreshing.

The Great New Orleans Kidnapping Case is about the complexity of racial identity in a pivotal historical moment; Hannah Mary Tabbs and the Disembodied Torso is about how a particular African American woman could exploit the color line and manipulate both whites and blacks for her own purposes; and Goat Castle is about how the memory of slavery continued to shape race relations seven decades after Emancipation.

[...]all three use these stories to engage with the public and convince people to care about the history of race, sex, and power. ________ The earliest of these three books, chronologically, is The Great New Orleans Kidnapping Case.

With the Republican-controlled national government still occupying Louisiana to ensure order and equity, African Americans "poured from plantations into its working-class neighborhoods" where they experienced a freedom like nothing before.

T1  - “Write the story you want to read”: world-queering through slash fanfiction creation
TT  - Queering through slash fanfiction creation
AN  - 2409030707
AB  - PurposeThis pilot study explores how queer slash fanfiction writers reorient cis/heteronormative entertainment media (EM) content to create queer information worlds.Design/methodology/approachConstructivist grounded theory was employed to explore queer individuals' slash fanfiction reading and creation practices. Slash fanfiction refers to fan-written texts that recast cis/heteronormative content with queer characters, relationships, and themes. Theoretical sampling drove ten semi-structured interviews with queer slash writers and content analysis of both Captain America slash and material features found on two online fanfiction platforms, Archive of Our Own and fanfiction.net. “Queer” serves as a theoretical lens through which to explore non-cis/heteronormative perspectives on gender and sexuality.FindingsParticipants' interactions with and creation of slash fanfiction constitute world-queering practices wherein individuals reorient cis/heteronormative content, design systems, and form community while developing their identities over time. Findings suggest ways that queer creators respond to, challenge, and reorient cis/heteronormative narratives perpetuated by EM and other information sources, as well as ways their practices are constrained by structural power dynamics.Research limitations/implicationsThis initial data collection only begins to explore the topic with ten interviews. The participant sample lacks racial diversity while the content sample focuses on one fandom. However, results suggest future directions for theoretical sampling that will continue to advance constructs developed from the data.Originality/valueThis research contributes to evolving perspectives on information creation and queer individuals' information practices. In particular, findings expand theoretical frameworks related to small worlds and ways in which members of marginalized populations grapple with exclusionary normativity.

T1  - How Politico-Economic Systems Shape Individuals' Value of Elderly Care: Evidence From the German Reunification
AN  - 2382687059
AB  - Background and Objectives Perceptions of how societies should care for the elderly people can differ among countries. This study examines to what extent individuals' value of informal care is shaped by the politico-economic system in which they grew up and if this value adjusts once an individual lives in a different politico-economic system. Research Design and Methods We use data from the German Family Panel and take advantage of the unique setting of the German separation and reunification. Probit models are used to examine the effect of being born in East Germany on individuals' value of informal care relative to employment at different birth cohorts and survey waves (N = 14,093). Average marginal effects are calculated. Results Twenty years after reunification, East Germans who spent their adolescence under communism exhibit a higher value of informal care relative to employment than West Germans who grew up in a western social market economy. Differences in values between East and West Germans do not significantly converge over time. Discussion and Implications Individuals' value of informal care is deeply shaped by the politico-economic system in which they grew up. If immigration policies are introduced to increase the care for elderly people, differences in individuals' cultural perceptions of elderly care should be considered as these will not suddenly adjust.

T1  - Reframing integration: Information marginalization and information resistance among migrant workers
TT  - Reframing integration
AN  - 2533738304
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore a different perspective about the role that information plays in the integration process of migrant workers by exploring the views and opinions of individuals and organizations that work with these communities on a daily basis. The study proposes a new perspective of Ager and Strang’s framework of integration by looking at its different elements through the perspective provided by Gibson and Martin’s (2019) concept of information marginalization and Dervin’s sense-making notion of resistance.Design/methodology/approachTen intermediaries working with migrants were interviewed using semi-structure interviews. They were analyzed using an integrative approach of deductive and inductive content analysis and rendered categories drawn from the theoretical frameworks and categories that emerged from the data.FindingsThe content analysis of the data revealed that information marginalization is characterized by the lack of cultural knowledge and lack of language proficiency that impact the migrants abilities to fulfill their everyday needs, experience a safe and stable environment. Information marginalization results in migrants experiencing self-protective behaviors such as secrecy and an inability to trust information sources that are not contextualized by insiders. Findings show that information resistance can be overcome by making information available in relevant formats and distributed through trusted sources.Social implicationsThe study revises the notion of information marginalization by trying to understand the social and cultural gap that from both sides of the issues of integration.Originality/valueThe study presents a different perspective of the role of information in the integration process of migrants by examining the views and opinions of intermediaries working with these populations. Also, the study reframes existing notions of information marginalization and resistance by addressing both sides of the cultural and social gap embodies marginalization.

T1  - Self-Assessment of Social and Family Loneliness in Elderly during COVID-19 Pandemic in Relation to Current Level and Type of Communication Intensity
TT  - RAZLIKA U SAMOPROCJENI SOCIJALNE I OBITELJSKE USAMLJENOSTI KOD STARIJIH OSOBA TIJEKOM PANDEMIJE COVID–19 U ODNOSU NA AKTUALNU RAZINU I VRSTU INTENZITETA KOMUNIKACIJE
AN  - 2528236479
AB  - Due to the spread of coronavirus people throughout the world, many countries, Croatia included, have been forced to impose social distancing resulting in an increased number of people at risk of another public health problem – loneliness. Loneliness can be defined as the presence of negative emotions associated with the perceived social exclusion and is identified as one of the major issues of the aging population. There is a relatively small number of studies either dealing with the use of various communication methods, particularly information and communication technologies, by the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic or determining potential benefits of such activities. The aim of this research was to determine the difference in self-assessment of social and family loneliness according to the means of communication used by the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was conducted in March and April 2020 covering the period from the introduction of the epidemiological measures of social distancing and self-isolation until the relaxation of virus-related restrictions in Croatia. The research included 107 subjects over the age of 65 living in their own homes in the Croatian city of Bjelovar. A Frequency of the Used Communication Methods Questionnaire was constructed for the purpose of this research. The Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults was used to determine the level of loneliness. The obtained results indicate that lower levels of social and family loneliness were shown by subjects who stated in their self-assessment a higher intensity level of communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as making telephone/mobile phone calls, using information technology (computers for video calls, social networks, etc.) and mobile chat applications (Viber, Skype, WhatsApp, etc.), as well as having face-to-face communication. Subjects who rarely or never communicated by using any means of the abovementioned communication showed higher levels of social and family loneliness. Results of this research suggest that using various communication methods, particularly modern communication technologies, have a positive effect on reducing the level of loneliness in the elderly. Teamwork of gerontologists, communication technologists and other experts who work with older population could introduce them to communication technology thus making them more satisfied and improving their quality of life.Alternate abstract:Zbog širenja korona virusa ljudi diljem svijeta pa tako i u Hrvatskoj prisiljeni su na socijalno distanciranje čime raste broj osoba koje ulaze u rizik još jednog javnozdravstvenog problema, a to je usamljenost. Usamljenost se može definirati kao stanje prisutnosti negativnih osjećaja povezanih s percipiranom socijalnom izolacijom, te se navodi kao jedan od najizraženijih problema starenja. Relativno je malen broj istraživanja koja se bave korištenjem različitih metoda komuniciranja, posebice informacijsko komunikacijskih tehnologija kod starijih osoba tijekom pandemije COVID-19 i utvrđivanja eventualne dobiti koja bi ta aktivnost imala. Cilj ovog istraživanja bio je utvrditi razliku u samoprocjeni socijalne i obiteljske usamljenosti prema načinu komunikacije kod starijih osoba tijekom pandemije COVID-19. Istraživanje je provedeno u ožujku i travnju 2020. godine, točnije u periodu od uvođenja epidemioloških mjera socijalnog distanciranja i samoizolacije do perioda popuštanja mjera u suzbijanju širenja korona virusa u Hrvatskoj. U istraživanju je sudjelovalo 107 ispitanika starosti višoj od 65 godina koji žive u vlastitom kućanstvu na području Bjelovara. Za potrebe istraživanja je konstruiran Indeks o učestalosti načina komunikacije. Za provjeru razine usamljenosti korištena je Skala socijalne i emocionalne usamljenosti. Dobiveni rezultati ukazuju da manju socijalnu i obiteljsku usamljenost pokazuju ispitanici koji samoprocjenjuju višu razinu komunikacije tijekom pandemije COVID–19 putem razgovara telefonom/mobitelom, informacijskom tehnologijom (uporabom računala: video poziv, socijalne mreže i dr.), razgovora lice u lice te putem mobilnih aplikacija (Viber, Skype, WhatsApp i dr.). Ispitanici koji uopće ne komuniciraju i oni koji vrlo rijetko komuniciraju bilo kojim od ispitivanih načina komunikacije pokazali su veću socijalnu i obiteljsku usamljenost. Rezultati ovoga istraživanja ukazuju na pozitivan primjer korištenja različitih metoda komuniciranja, posebice modernih tehnologija za komunikaciju kod starijih osoba u smanjenju usamljenosti. Kroz timski rad gerontologa, komunikacijskih tehnologa i ostalih stručnjaka koji se bave starijim osobama komunikacijska tehnologija mogla bi se približiti starijim osobama i doprinijeti zadovoljnijem i kvalitetnijem životu osoba starije životne dobi.

T1  - Exceptional Injustice: Facebook as a Reflection of Race- and Gender-Based Narratives Following the Death of George Floyd
AN  - 2471229806
AB  - Following the death of George Floyd, Facebook posts about the Black Lives Matter movement (BLM) surged, creating the opportunity to examine reactions by race and sex. This study employed a two-part mixed methods approach beginning with an analysis of posts from a single college student’s Facebook newsfeed over a 12-week period, commencing on the date of George Floyd’s death (25 May 2020). A triangulation protocol enhanced exploratory observational–archival Facebook posts with qualitative data from 24 Black and White college students queried about their views of BLM and policing. The Facebook data revealed that White males, who were the least active in posting about BLM, were most likely to criticize BLM protests. They also believed incidents of police brutality were exceptions that tainted an otherwise commendable profession. In contrast, Black individuals commonly saw the case of George Floyd as consistent with a longstanding pattern of injustice that takes an emotional toll, and as an egregious exemplification of racism that calls for indictment of the status quo. The exploratory data in this article also illustrate how even for a cause célèbre, attention on Facebook ebbs over time. This phenomenon obscures the urgency of effecting change, especially for persons whose understanding of racism is influenced by its coverage on social media. The need to recognize the divergence of views—how they vary by sex and race and their connection to social media—remains critical for progress in determining the best steps forward in race relations and police reform.

T1  - Avatar identification mediates the relationship between peer phubbing and mobile game addiction
AN  - 2457703450
AB  - We investigated the relationship between snubbing a peer in favor of using a cell phone (phubbing) and mobile game addiction by introducing avatar identification as a mediator, and feelings of social exclusion and perception of belonging as moderators. Participants were 530 Chinese mobile game users who completed a survey comprising measures of peer phubbing, avatar identification, feelings of social exclusion, perception of belonging, and mobile game addiction. Results were as follows: (a) peer phubbing affected mobile game addiction through avatar identification; (b) feelings of social exclusion moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and avatar identification, and the mediating role of avatar identification in this link; and (c) perception of belonging was linked to the relationship between peer phubbing and feelings of social exclusion, affecting avatar identification and the mediating role of avatar identification in this link. Our results demonstrate the impact mechanism of peer phubbing on mobile game addiction and provide a new perspective on mobile game addiction prevention.

T1  - Effects of social exclusion and implicit theories of personality on nostalgic consumption
AN  - 2377699478
AB  - We conducted 2 studies to examine how social exclusion and implicit theories of personality interact to influence preferences for products that evoke nostalgia. In Study 1 we tested how individuals' implicit personality (entity vs. incremental theorist type) moderate the effects of social exclusion on nostalgic consumption. Results showed that socially excluded (vs. socially included) consumers were more likely to consume nostalgic products when the consumers were entity (vs. incremental) theorists. In Study 2 we conducted a different manipulation of social exclusion and individuals' implicit personality, and also examined the mediating role of self-continuity. Results showed that self-continuity mediated the interaction effect of social exclusion and implicit personality on preferences for nostalgic products. The results were robust whether the manipulation of social exclusion was in an online dating or fitness club application context, and for different nostalgic product choices, comprising chips and cookies.

T1  - The impact of race relations on NFL attendance: An econometric analysis
AN  - 2344551098
AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts.

T1  - An online experiment on the influence of online user comments on attitudes toward a minority group
AN  - 2318594529
AB  - In recent years, there is interest in examining the effects of user comments on online content consumers' attitudes and perceptions. Building on theoretical foundations from social psychology and using an online experimental design, we investigated whether exposure to online comments attached to news content affects attitudes toward refugees. We recruited students from a public university in the Mediterranean region and, after administering a printed pretest on their attitudes toward refugees, we assigned them into three groups: one that read a series of positive comments about refugees (positive experimental group), one that read a series of negative comments about refugees (negative experimental group) and one that did not read comments (control group). The comments and a neutral reference news video were communicated to the participants via email during a five-day period after the pretest. After the implementation of the experimental stimuli, we administered a modified version of the pretest as a posttest. We found that exposure to positive comments reduced prejudice and that the intensity of prior prejudice was positively associated with the magnitude of prejudice reduction. Exposure to negative comments did not affect prejudice. A repeat posttest, administered one week after the posttest, showed stability of the observed attitude change.

T1  - Cyber-Routines, Political Attitudes, and Exposure to Violence-Advocating Online Extremism
AN  - 2447241820
AB  - The Internet’s relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online.

T1  - Perceived uniqueness: Locus of control, social exclusion, and choice
AN  - 2323049711
AB  - We examined the influence of locus of control on the relationship between social exclusion and preference for distinctive choices. Participants were 212 undergraduate students at a university in Central China, who completed measures of social exclusion, locus of control, choice, and perceived uniqueness. Results showed that participants who believed that the environment controlled their fate (external locus of control) preferred more distinctive choices in a social exclusion context than in a social inclusion context, whereas participants who believed that they could control the environment (internal locus of control) preferred less distinctive choices. Further, perceived uniqueness mediated the effect of social exclusion and locus of control on choice. These results add to the literature on social exclusion and personal control.

T1  - Social dominance orientation and stereotype influence perception of social distance between classes
AN  - 2230835141
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China.

T1  - Leave or remain? European identification, legitimacy of European integration, and political attitudes towards the EU
AN  - 2169524197
AB  - In this paper, we look at the relationship between European identification and political support for (or opposition to) EU membership. First, we argue that conceptualizing political attitudes towards the EU as a direct product of European identification (a) neglects the distinction between the social reality of Europe and the political reality of the EU and (b) leads to psychological reductionism. We propose that the relationship should instead be conceptualized as mediated by legitimacy perceptions and as moderated by social‐level variables. Second, we look at three spheres of European integration and propose that their perceived legitimacy is appraised through the following principles: (a) normative solidarity for wealth sharing, (b) political authority for sharing political decisions, and (c) collective self‐realization for the sharing of practices. We illustrate the key mediating role of those principles by drawing on data from a survey ran across five European countries. Third, we argue that these meditational relationships are in turn moderated by social, political, and ideological realities and illustrate this point by looking at the case of United Kingdom in the context of the EU membership referendum. We point to an ideological assumption in the U.K. political landscape about the illegitimacy of EU supranational decision making and argue that this contributed to shape both the debate of the referendum campaign and its result.

T1  - Social Distance toward Syrian Refugees: The Role of Intergroup Anxiety in Facilitating Positive Relations
AN  - 2151163665
AB  - The number of asylum seekers and refugees across the world is rapidly increasing. Negative attitudes toward these groups are globally prevalent and typically hostile because most receiving country citizens perceive them to be a security threat and an economic burden. This paper aims to understand the antecedents of negative attitudes toward a large refugee group currently garnering a great deal of attention—Syrian refugees, and experimentally test ways to ameliorate negative attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 122), we investigated predictors of social distance—as a proxy for prejudice—and found right‐wing authoritarianism and intergroup anxiety to be significant predictors. In Study 2 (N = 162), we tested whether perceived acculturation orientation would predict social distance and found that Americans were less prejudiced toward Syrians who preferred to assimilate rather than integrate. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 153), we tested if a form of vicarious contact could reduce social distance via reduced intergroup anxiety; we found initial evidence for this mediation link. We discussed the potential for the vicarious contact intervention to foster positive intergroup relations and contribute to refugee wellbeing.

T1  - Stigmatized beliefs: Conspiracy theories, anticipated negative evaluation of the self, and fear of social exclusion
AN  - 2133258983
AB  - Can conspiracy theories be a source of social stigma? If it is true, it would follow that people may expect to be socially excluded when they express endorsement of conspiracy theories. This effect should be partially explained by the knowledge of the negative perceptions associated with conspiracy theories. In Study 1, inducing French internet users to write a text endorsing (vs. criticizing) conspiracy theories about the Charlie Hebdo shooting, led them to anticipate fear of social exclusion. This effect was mediated by anticipated negative evaluation of the self. In Study 2, inducing French internet users to imagine defending (vs. criticizing) conspiracy theories about the Charlie Hebdo shooting in front of an audience led them to anticipate fear of social exclusion. The effect was again mediated by anticipated negative evaluation of the self. To conclude, our findings demonstrate that conspiracy theories can be viewed as a source of social stigma.

T1  - Just a Show? Effects of Televised Debates on Political Attitudes and Preferences in Slovakia
AN  - 2121026395
AB  - The popularity of televised political debates is growing, attracting millions of viewers. However, evidence that such debates can shift voters’ attitudes is mixed and the impact on voters’ preference is also mixed. In addition, the evidence comes mostly from presidential elections in the United States and almost exclusively from established democracies. A call for comparative research in new democracies has been made several times. Our research answers the call and contributes to this debate by comparing two experimental studies based on first-order national elections and second-order European Parliament elections in Slovakia. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been performed in a post-communist EU country. We employed a pre-test/post-test experimental design in a controlled environment with participants randomly assigned to both groups. The results show that debate exposure has a stronger effect on opinions about candidates’ leadership skills, credibility, and economic competence if the candidates were previously unknown. Familiarity with the candidates and pre-existing preferences also function as a block to preference change. Almost all of our findings are in line with previous research originating from Western contexts. Therefore, we conclude that the causal mechanism linking debate exposure to voters’ preference and attitudes in the post-communist context is similar to that in Western countries with long-term democratic traditions.

T1  - Who Is the Muslim? Discursive Representations of the Muslims and Islam in Indian Prime-Time News
AN  - 2124319108
AB  - A cursory look at Indian prime-time news tells us much about the tone and tenor of the people associated with it. Exaggerations, hyperbole, and tempers run wild, and news anchors flail in theatrical rage. News channels and news editors display their ideological affiliations subliminally. These affiliations—a factor of personal political stances, funding bodies, and investors—lead to partisan bias in the framing of news and, in some cases, can easily translate into racial prejudice. In this paper, I examine news coverage related to Muslims in India. I study the coverage of two issues specifically—love jihad and triple talaq—in prime-time English news of two channels: Times Now and Republic TV. Love jihad is a term used to describe alleged campaigns carried out by Muslim men targeting non-Muslim women for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Triple talaq is a form of divorce that has been interpreted to allow Muslim men to legally divorce their wives by stating the word “talaq” three times. My analysis of the content, tone, and tenor of their coverage shows that these channels propagate associations between Islam and backwardness, ignorance, and violence through consistent employment of the following tropes: “Muslim women need to be saved from Muslim men”; “Hindu women need to be saved from Muslim men”; and, “Muslims are not fully Indian—they are anti-national”. I place this study of news media within the current political climate in India and briefly touch on the conversations it guides and provokes. This is a first step in detailing a problem. It is also a call for further analysis on this subject to examine and evaluate if and how discourse manipulates public conversations and policy decisions.

T1  - Cops, lies, and videotape: Police reform and the media in Hawaii
AN  - 2071973955
AB  - Police accountability is among the most prominent criminal justice issues in America today. Accounts of police misconduct captured by new communication and information technologies have played a central role in elevating this issue. On the continental US, the Black Lives Matter movement has driven these events, lodging the political debate in the larger context of racial inequality. In Hawaii, a parallel but distinctive series of events has occurred. A push for greater police accountability has emerged, but it has been more closely associated with gender relations than race relations and has involved women in political office rather than street protests. The Hawaii case also provides some generalizable lessons, particularly regarding the context-specific roles that gender and race relations play, and the potential for video evidence in promoting police reform.

T1  - Can Elites Shape Public Attitudes Toward Immigrants?: Evidence from the 2016 US Presidential Election
AN  - 2430650735
AB  - It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump’s statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages’ effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

T1  - The role of national identity, religious identity, and intergroup contact on social distance across multiple social divides in Turkey
AN  - 2098784177
AB  - Using a nationally representative dataset from Turkey, we examined the effects of national identity, religious identity, religious practice, and intergroup contact on social distance towards disliked groups along ethnic (Turks vs. Kurds), religious (Sunnis vs. Alevis) and ideological divides (supporters vs. opponents of the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine two mechanisms (via perceived threat and empathy) through which ingroup identification and intergroup contact influence social distance toward disliked groups. Perceived threat, but not empathy, mediated the effect of national identification on higher social distance towards Kurds, AKP supporters and AKP opponents. Both perceived threat and empathy mediated the effects of religious practice on distance towards Alevis. Intergroup contact had both direct and indirect effects (via threat and empathy) on social distance. Multigroup SEM showed that contact’s effects did not vary across outgroup targets. By contrast, the effects of national and religious identity on social distance varied depending on the outgroup target. The findings highlight the importance of considering identity content and meaning attached to social categories in making predictions about the influence of identification with different social categories.

T1  - Time Well Wasted? Online Procrastination During Times of Unemployment
AN  - 2036738459
AB  - This article examines the argument regarding whether perceived social exclusion during unemployment leads to procrastination through online media, which in turn lessens the job search efforts of the unemployed. Based on data from 386 unemployed Internet users, we argue that online procrastination plays an important role in the lives of the unemployed but has no immediate effects on their perceived job search efforts. Contextual factors play an important role; that is, the amount of motivational control that the unemployed can muster exerts a strong effect on job search efforts. Generally, unemployed Internet users with low motivational control struggle more with their job search efforts. Thus, the recreational use of online media as such is not necessarily detrimental to the efforts invested in finding a job; instead, online skill-building and motivational support are key antecedents to better empower the unemployed to use the Internet productively for finding reemployment.

T1  - "Celebrity 2.0 and beyond!" Effects of Facebook profile sources on social networking advertising
AN  - 1984837039
AB  - Two experiments examined the effects of different sources (celebrity versus peer consumer) of celebrity-brand-related user-generated content (UGC) embedded in a social networking site (SNS). Consistent with the basic premises of warranting theory (stronger effects of other-endorsement than self-endorsement) and social identity theory (more positive effects of ingroup than outgroup), Experiment 1 demonstrated more positive effects of celebrity brand endorsements posted on a peer consumer's (other; in-group identity) Facebook profile page on source credibility perception and parasocial interaction with the celebrity than celebrity brand endorsements posted on the celebrity's own (self; out-group identity) Facebook profile page. Social identification mediated the effects of the Facebook profile source on parasocial interaction with the celebrity. Experiment 2 indicated that a movie star's Facebook presence contributed to a more positive attitude toward the celebrity. A peer Facebook user's movie endorsement UGC resulted in greater advertising believability, more positive attitude toward, and more positive emotional reactions toward system-generated content (SGC) sponsored Facebook advertising than the movie star's self-promotion on his own Facebook page. In addition, movie involvement moderated the relationship between the Facebook profile source and advertising effectiveness.

T1  - Contextual Predictors of Protest Behavior on Social Media: A #Ferguson Case Study
AN  - 1993058063
AB  - Using an original Python program, we extracted data from the 2014 #Ferguson Twitterstorm to explore contextual predictors of digital activism. Through content analysis we identify whether tweets related to police conduct, race relations, and perceptions of justice were influenced by local arrest rates and economic inequality. Instead, results suggest that race and partisanship drove much of the digital protest behavior. Negative perceptions of justice and police conduct largely originated from within Democratic-leaning communities and areas with larger African American populations. We speculate that deeper social grievances surfaced in the Ferguson case, causing the digital conversation to become both racialized and politicized.

T1  - Out‐group peer involvement in youth alcohol consumption
AN  - 1989861714
AB  - Recent studies of alcohol consumption among students have consistently linked in‐group influence with excessive drinking. Concurrently, these studies have largely overlooked the influence of non‐alcohol‐consuming peers (the out‐group) on the in‐group's decisions to consume alcohol. However, out‐groups can have a significant impact on in‐group members' decisions regarding publicly consumed products (White, Simpson, & Argo, ), such as is the case of alcohol. In light of this, our study aims to explore how in‐group members' views of their consumption of alcohol are influenced by their out‐group. This study uses Social Identity Theory as the theoretical lens to explain consumer interaction with the out‐group (abstainers) and subsequent views of in‐group members (alcohol consumers). A social constructivist approach is adopted to enable this exploration of meaning, with concomitant use of the qualitative narrative methodology. A sample of 18 postgraduate students studying in the UK was selected. Narratives were collected and analysed using thematic analysis. Although the widely accepted view is that people tend to avoid products or behaviours that are linked with an out‐group, this paper demonstrates conditions in which alcohol consumers appreciate the out‐group. Furthermore, it reveals how drinkers' interaction with their out‐group can lead to negative attitudes towards their in‐group and their own consumption of alcohol. Based on their views of out‐groups, we propose a categorisation of alcohol consumers into 3 groups: avoiders, open admirers, and covert admirers. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications for social marketers and policy makers.

T1  - Explaining between-race differences in African-American and European-American women's responses to breast density notification
AN  - 2006795339
AB  - Prior research shows between-race differences in women's knowledge and emotions related to having dense breasts, thus suggesting that between-race differences in behavioral decision-making following receipt of breast density (BD) notifications are likely. Guided by the theory of planned behavior, this study examined differences in emotion-related responses (i.e., anxiety, worry, confusion) and behavioral cognition (e.g., intentions, behavioral attitudes) following receipt of BD notifications among African American (AA) and European American (EA) women. This study also examined whether race-related perceptions (i.e., discrimination, group-based medical mistrust), relevant knowledge and socioeconomic status (SES) explained the between race differences. Michigan women (N = 457) who presented for routine screening mammogram and had dense breasts, no prior breast cancer diagnoses, and had screen-negative mammograms were recruited from July, 2015 to March 2016. MANOVA was used to examine between race differences in psychological responses (i.e., emotional responses and behavioral cognition), and a multi-group structural regression model was used to examine whether race-related constructs, knowledge and SES mediated the effect of race on emotional responses and behavioral cognition. Prior awareness of BD was accounted for in all analyses. AA women generally reported more negative psychological responses to receiving BD notifications regardless of prior BD awareness. AA women had more favorable perceptions related to talking to their physicians about the BD notifications. Generally, race-related perceptions, SES, and related knowledge partially accounted for the effect of race on psychological response. Race-related perceptions and SES partially accounted for the differences in behavioral intentions. Between-race differences in emotional responses to BD notifications did not explain differences in women's intentions to discuss BD notifications with their physicians. Future examinations are warranted to examine whether there are between-race differences in actual post-BD notification behaviors and whether similar race-related variables account for differences.

T1  - 'If everyone says so ...' Press narratives and image change in major event host cities
AN  - 1950807142
AB  - This paper looks into the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme as a leading example of culture-led regeneration intervention aimed at renewing or diversifying the economic base and positioning of host cities. One of the key claims associated with the programme is that it can transform the 'image' of a city. These image transformation claims are often supported by evidence of heightened or more positive media coverage in the short term. However, little evidence has generally been gathered to determine long-term, sustained image change. The paper seeks to at least partly address this lacuna by presenting evidence on the media representation of Glasgow and Liverpool over three decades. These two cities are widely perceived to be paradigmatic not only of successful culture-led regeneration but also of the power of the ECoC title to transform city image. The paper looks at the importance of the media narrative arc surrounding major cultural events in solidifying 'image change' processes, regardless of the existence of evidence to suggest a change in perceptions by local communities at the time the event is taking place. The core argument is that if media coverage about a particular place shows a significant change in focus and attitude over time, is voluminous enough and cuts across geographical and journalistic variations, then it effectively becomes a key source of evidence of de facto image change. The key proposition in this paper is that evidenceable and sustained change in media representations of place can be taken as tantamount to image change. This is based on the assumption that widespread and longitudinal trends in media representation have the capacity to both reflect and influence public attitudes and perceptions.

T1  - Decreases in implicit self-esteem explain the racial impact of microaggressions among Asian Americans
AN  - 1980993177
AB  - Asian Americans are commonly perceived as perpetual foreigners and, therefore, not "true" Americans. Asian Americans report inquiries about nationality and English abilities as the most common forms of racial microaggressions perpetrated by White Americans (Sue, 2015). Race theorists assert that these microaggressions are race-related and marginalize Asian Americans. Scholars have claimed that these subtle acts are harmful, yet only a few studies have uncovered the mechanisms by which racial microaggressions affect mental and physical well-being (Ong, Burrow, Fuller-Rowell, Ja, & Sue, 2013; Wong, Derthick, David, Saw, & Okazaki, 2013). The current study conceptualized racial microaggressions as a stressor to address the major gaps in research. Specifically, this study (a) experimentally tested the race-related nature of the microaggression event to determine whether a White American perpetrator would elicit more stress in Asian Americans compared to an Asian American perpetrator and (b) examined threats to explicit and implicit self-esteem as possible mediators of microaggression-generated stress. Findings confirmed that the race of the perpetrator did have an impact on stress among Asian Americans. In the multiple meditation analysis, experience with a White American perpetrator, compared to an Asian American perpetrator, lowered implicit self-esteem, which resulted in more stress. Implications and strategies for counseling Asian American clients are discussed.

T1  - Digital inequalities in rural Australia: A double jeopardy of remoteness and social exclusion
AN  - 1962258891
AB  - In an era of a highly digitalized society, Australia's rural areas continue to be at a digital disadvantage. With the increasing penetration of information and communications technology (ICT) into all public and private realms, there is a need to examine the deeply rooted digital divide and how it is intertwined with issues of social exclusion in rural communities. This study focused on remoteness as an indicator of digital exclusion, and investigated its relationship with other dimensions of social exclusion. A secondary data analysis using Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) regional data revealed that remoteness was a strong predictor of home Internet and broadband connectivity, but digital divide was exacerbated by other socio-demographic factors such as educational levels and employment status. When implementing digital inclusion strategies, both supply (infrastructure) and demand (education levels, industry sector, employment opportunities, socio-demographics) factors must be considered.

T1  - Internal Migration, Social Exclusion, and Victimization: An Analysis of Chinese Rural-to-Urban Migrants
AN  - 1905236047
AB  - Objectives: 
This article applies a multidimensional social exclusion framework to examine Chinese rural-to-urban migrant victimization. 
Method: 
Data from the 2012 China Labor Dynamics Survey is used to examine whether Chinese migrants are more likely to be victimized compared to urban residents and to what extent the prior findings on the meditating roles of social exclusion between immigration and victimization can be applied to understand Chinese migrants' victimization. 
Results: 
Findings reveal the elevated victimization risks among nationwide rural-to-urban migrants. Logistic regression models find that social exclusion mediates the link between migrant status and victimization and that social exclusion predicts victimization. 
Conclusions: 
The discriminative institutional arrangements in China are a major force of the universal disadvantages of Chinese migrants. That is, it is not the migrant status itself, but the social exclusion suffered by individuals that increase the likelihood of being criminally victimized.

T1  - Chronic social exclusion and evidence for the resignation stage: An empirical investigation
AN  - 1907596938
AB  - Experiences of social exclusion, including ostracism and rejection, can last anywhere from a few seconds to many years. Most research focused on short-term social exclusion, whereas virtually no empirical work has investigated the experiences of long-term social exclusion. Williams theorized that prolonged experiences of social exclusion (i.e., ostracism) would cause individuals to pass from the reflexive and reflective stages to the resignation stage characterized by the inability to recover threatened psychological needs and feelings of alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression. Across two studies, we explored this prediction--and, in light of pain overlap theories, considered the possibility that chronic exclusion and chronic pain induce common psychological responses. Study 1 consisted of a quasi-experimental study involving five groups of participants: (1) those with chronic experiences of social exclusion (n = 82), (2) those with chronic physical pain (n = 82), (3) those with chronic hypertension (n = 69), (4) those with chronic kidney disease (n = 60), and (5) a group of healthy people (n = 83). Participants filled out a questionnaire including measures of need threat, negative emotions, and the four key outcomes linked to the resignation stage (i.e., alienation, unworthiness, helplessness, and depression). Although our data showed little evidence to support the psychological overlap between chronic exclusion and chronic physical pain, the results suggested that chronic experiences of social exclusion were associated with higher levels of negative emotions and resignation stage outcomes compared to participants in all the other groups. Furthermore, we found that threatened psychological needs mediated the effect of social exclusion on the resignation stage outcomes. Study 2 tested, but found no support for, the possibility that acute experiences of social exclusion could increase the resignation stage outcomes. Overall, our research indicates that when people are exposed to short-term exclusion, they recover their threatened psychological needs. However, when enduring chronic social exclusion, they do not, and enter the resignation stage.

T1  - A Qualitative Study of the Integration of Arab Muslim Israelis Suffering from Mental Disorders into the Normative Community
AN  - 1890005485
AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

T1  - Real-life prosocial behavior decreases after being socially excluded by avatars, not agents
AN  - 1932136875
AB  - The concept of social exclusion has recently gained more attention in the context of online social interactions. However, there is only little data regarding the impact of virtual social exclusion on subsequent real-life social behaviors. Thus, this study set out to examine a virtual version of the common social exclusion scenario, the Cyberball-Paradigm (Williams & Jarvis, 2006), and test for behavioral consequences in a sample of 45 students. Both the virtual characters' agency and the experience of social presence were controlled for. Findings indicate that ostracized individuals show less prosocial behavior in a helping task and keep more seating distance to a confederate than included participants. Also, virtual social exclusion constitutes a significant threat to fundamental human needs like social control, self-esteem and belonging and causes an increase in uncertainty, sadness and anger as well as a decrease in happiness. Avatars and agents seemed to equally endanger human needs and lead to the same seating distance. However, avatar excluded persons also had higher levels of sadness and were less helpful than avatar included persons, who in turn were more confident. Thus, while the Media Equation Concept (Nass & Moon, 2000) holds true for the immediate reaction to social exclusion (i.e., avatars and agents equally threaten fundamental needs), the delayed emotional and behavioral reactions differ for avatars and agents, possibly because they are preceded by cognitive evaluation (c.f.,Temporal Need-Threat Model; Williams, 2009). Implications of these findings for everyday online social interactions (i.e., in MMORPGs) are discussed.

T1  - Public attitudes towards alcohol control policies in Scotland and England: Results from a mixed-methods study
AN  - 1912558087
AB  - The harmful effects of heavy drinking on health have been widely reported, yet public opinion on governmental responsibility for alcohol control remains divided. This study examines UK public attitudes towards alcohol policies, identifies underlying dimensions that inform these, and relationships with perceived effectiveness. A cross-sectional mixed methods study involving a telephone survey of 3477 adult drinkers aged 16-65 and sixteen focus groups with 89 adult drinkers in Scotland and England was conducted between September 2012 and February 2013. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to reduce twelve policy statements into underlying dimensions. These dimensions were used in linear regression models examining alcohol policy support by demographics, drinking behaviour and perceptions of UK drinking and government responsibility. Findings were supplemented with a thematic analysis of focus group transcripts. A majority of survey respondents supported all alcohol policies, although the level of support varied by type of policy. Greater enforcement of laws on under-age sales and more police patrolling the streets were strongly supported while support for pricing policies and restricting access to alcohol was more divided. PCA identified four main dimensions underlying support on policies: alcohol availability, provision of health information and treatment services, alcohol pricing, and greater law enforcement. Being female, older, a moderate drinker, and holding a belief that government should do more to reduce alcohol harms were associated with higher support on all policy dimensions. Focus group data revealed findings from the survey may have presented an overly positive level of support on all policies due to differences in perceived policy effectiveness. Perceived effectiveness can help inform underlying patterns of policy support and should be considered in conjunction with standard measures of support in future research on alcohol control policies.

T1  - Justice Concerns Can Feed Nationalistic Concerns and Impede Solidarity in the Euro Crisis: How Victim Sensitivity Translates into Political Attitudes
AN  - 1877051943
AB  - We investigated how victim sensitivity and news media exposure conjointly contribute to the formation of political attitudes in the context of the euro crisis. Study 1 (N = 208) showed that observer-sensitive individuals were more likely and victim-sensitive individuals were less likely to support solidarity with countries in need of financial support. These correlations were mediated by affective components of political attitudes, namely nationalistic concerns, resentment about and empathic concerns with debtor countries. In Study 2 (N = 51), using a pre-post within-subjects design, we showed that framing the euro crisis in an 'exploitation frame" (compared to a 'solidarity frame') in news media reports was more likely to trigger nationalistic concerns and, consequently, decrease support of solidarity in victim-sensitive individuals compared to their less victim-sensitive counterparts. These results are in line with the SeMI model and previous findings that victim sensitivity is linked to fear of being exploited in intergroup relations.

T1  - A gap in the market: The conceptualisation of surveillance, security, privacy and trust in public opinion surveys
AN  - 1903828321
AB  - Understanding the attitudes of members of the public towards the impact on their privacy of surveillance technologies used to enhance public security is an essential, but complex, consideration for policy makers, where public trust plays a central role. One way of understanding public attitudes is via the assessment of public opinion surveys. However, to ensure that public attitudes are appropriately being measured across all four concepts (privacy, security, trust and surveillance) it is necessary to consider how existing surveys conceptualise and operationalise these terms. This article undertakes precisely this consideration, in order to evaluate existing practices and provide recommendations for future public opinion surveys on surveillance technologies or practices intended to provide security, but which may impact privacy. We have found three issues relating to past approaches: past surveys do not always adequately define or conceptualise the terms they are employing. Second, surveys sometimes rely on the use of examples in lieu of definitions. Finally, and most importantly, we find that existing surveys do not always adequately examine the impact of the public's trust towards the use of surveillance technologies to enhance security, but which may affect their privacy.

T1  - "We Need More 'US' in Schools!!": Centering Black Adolescent Girls' Literacy and Language Practices in Online School Spaces
AN  - 1967046477
AB  - This qualitative inquiry, situated within the social networking site, Facebook and an urban public library, examined the way six Black adolescent girls represented self and made sense of and disrupted representations of Black girlhood through book club discussions of the street literature text, PUSH by Sapphire. Online discussions, field observations, focus group interviews, and a researcher journal were employed. Hip-hop feminist theory, new literacy studies, and reader response theory undergirded this study. Findings revealed that participants' self-representations were shaped by (a) the use of multiple modalities (b) the collective Black girl experience (c) society's neglect of Black girls (d) perspectives around personal traumatic experiences; and (e) social norms around literacy and language.

T1  - Do Amoral Familism and Political Distrust Really Affect North-South Differences in Italy?
AN  - 1789786343
AB  - Especially in southern Italy, Banfield's amoral familism is considered an obstacle to the formation of associations and growth of political participation. This article discusses Banfield's concept, showing that it has been vulgarized merely as familism and, in particular, demonstrates that Banfield intended amoral familism to be understood in terms of political distrust. We investigated whether amoral familism or political distrust, operationalized as an individual difference variable, mediated the relationships between personality traits, personal values, and conventional and unconventional political acts, controlling for differences in political attitude. We recruited 405 participants, distributed across north, central, and southern Italy, to complete a questionnaire on political participation that also assessed Big Five personality factors, values, sociability and political attitude (expertise, interest, self-efficacy), and a new scale assessing amoral familism as a form of political distrust. Regression analyses were used to identify the best predictors of political acts, then structural equation modeling was used to test a model of political participation. Like political attitudes, familism mediated the relationships between personality traits, especially "openness to experience" and "taking conventional and unconventional political acts." However, our data do not confirm the stereotype that northern and southern Italians differ in their tendency to amoral familism as defined by Banfield.

T1  - Digital inclusion and social exclusion: The political economy of value in a networked world
AN  - 1780986129
AB  - Current debates around user-generated content and its role in wealth generation can be understood as attempts to apply or develop a theory of exploitation or, more broadly, a theory of value. This article seeks to provide a theory based on the network asymmetries of late capitalism, which tend to unevenly distribute network resources through a logic of "digital inclusion." The mechanisms that enable this asymmetric situation are introduced, and the historical displacements that have given rise to those mechanisms are briefly discussed. The conceptual model that emerges from the analysis reveals the salient features of the contemporary connexionist world that transcend, but do not erase, class boundaries.

T1  - Constructing Immigrants: Portrayals of Migrant Groups in British National Newspapers, 2010-2012: IMR
AN  - 1774373704
AB  - Public opposition to immigration in Britain reflects perceptions of immigrants that focus disproportionately on "illegal" immigration and asylum seekers, rather than more numerous workers, students, and family members. This study examines coverage of immigration in the British national press, to see whether press portrayals of migrants provide a basis for these images of immigration underlying public attitudes. We use corpus linguistic methods to analyze 43 million words of news from 2010 to 2012. Among other findings, we show that press portrayals match public perceptions of migrants, with "illegal immigrants" and "failed asylum seekers" as predominant depictions in broadsheet and tabloid newspapers.

T1  - It's The Sun Wot Won It': Evidence of media influence on political attitudes and voting from a UK quasi-natural experiment
AN  - 1770928594
AB  - Do print media significantly impact political attitudes and party identification? To examine this question, we draw on a rare quasi-natural experiment that occurred when The Sun, a right-leaning UK tabloid, shifted its support to the Labour party in 1997 and back to the Conservative party in 2010. We compared changes in party identification and political attitudes among Sun readers with non-readers and other newspaper readerships. We find that The Sun's endorsements were associated with a significant increase in readers' support for Labour in 1997, approximately 525,000 votes, and its switch back was associated with about 550,000 extra votes for the Conservatives in 2010. Although we observed changes in readers' party preference, there was no effect on underlying political preferences. The magnitude of these changes, about 2% of the popular vote, would have been unable to alter the outcome of the 1997 General Election, but may have affected the 2010 Election.

T1  - No longer a waltz between red wine and mint tea: The portrayal of the children of immigrants in French newspapers (2003-2013)
AN  - 1761734215
AB  - Despite the egalitarianism that informs French civic culture, the socio-economic marginalization of citizens of non-European origin, mostly from North African countries, provide empirical evidence that challenges the French Republican ideal of integration. Such marginalization needs to be reconciled especially within the cultural realm. In this article, we look at French newspapers' coverage of the children of immigrants during a ten-year period (2003-2013). We analyse coverage in three major newspapers since French news coverage can be considered to follow a specific political/literary model, which has a profound influence on how news in France is both coded and decoded. The article examines the ways political allegiances affect the portrayals of the children of immigrants. Using the constant comparative method, an analysis of the discourse over time shows that the narratives of integration of the decedents of North African immigrants have been complicated by the 2005 riots, both as a romantic illusion, a reflection of reality, or a possible outcome of events. The three newspapers grapple with the ambiguous position of the children of immigrants in French society in different ways. Coverage of children of immigrants continues to be divided along partisan lines which are bounded by the political/literary model of journalism. What is also clear is that the changing portrayal of children of immigrants is intrinsically attached to evolving social, political, and economic dynamics both nationally and beyond state borders.

T1  - MONEY OR ATTENTION? SEX DIFFERENCES IN REACTIONS TO SOCIAL EXCLUSION
AN  - 1721707466
AB  - We examined differences in the ways in which men and women perceive and react to social exclusion. Men typically experience agentic-type threats in a social exclusion context and are motivated to improve their agentic belief in themselves, whereas women experience communal-type threats and pay greater attention to others. In this study, we employed the pursuit of money as an agentic form of compensation and pursuit of attention as a communal form of compensation. In 2 experiments with high school students as participants (N = 103 and 126, respectively), we found that social exclusion increases the preference of men for a high salary and the preference of women for conspicuous products, and that self-focus mediates these effects. We have contributed to the literature by exploring the different coping strategies of men and women who face social exclusion.

T1  - Race and attitudes toward police: the mediating effect of social distance
AN  - 1752994925; 201601142
AB  - Purpose - Given the consistent finding in the literature that members of minority groups hold less favorable views of the police than white citizens, social distance may be an important, yet untested, mediator. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of social distance net of other established correlates. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of students attending a university in the northeastern USA completed an online survey in 2013. The survey was about their contact with the police, attitudes toward the police, and lifestyles, among others. Findings - Race, along with other predictors, significantly influenced confidence in police. However, race is the only factor that turns nonsignificant when social distance is included in the model. Mediation tests confirmed that social distance mediates the relationship between race and confidence in the police. Research limitations/implications - To maximize confidence in the police, administrators should focus on closing the social distance between the public and the police through initiatives like community policing. Originality/value - While there is extensive research on public attitudes toward the police, social distance has been neglected as a determinant, despite movements like community policing that promote citizens' relational closeness to the police - that is, to decrease the social distance between police and the public. The current study would be an exploratory study and reference for future studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Descendants of Hardship: Prevalence, Drivers and Scarring Effects of Social Exclusion in Childhood
AN  - 1708207471
AB  - The social exclusion of children is problematic for two reasons. Young people typically inherit their marginal position from their family, and therefore cannot be held responsible for their hardship themselves; and social exclusion in childhood may affect their wellbeing and subsequent development, possibly leading to a "scarring effect" in later life. In this contribution we develop an instrument for measuring social exclusion among children. Social exclusion is regarded as a theoretical construct with four sub-dimensions: material deprivation, limited social participation, inadequate access to social rights, and a lack of normative integration. First we analyse data from a survey of 2,200 Dutch children, which contains a large set of social exclusion items. We applied nonlinear principal components analysis in order to construct a multidimensional scale. Measured in this way, the prevalence of social exclusion among children is 4.5%. Boys and children living in large families are more likely to experience social exclusion than girls and children with few siblings. The parental level of education and dependency on social security benefits are also important driving factors of childhood social exclusion. Subsequently we investigate the scarring effect. Longitudinal administrative income and household data covering 25 years were combined with a new survey of just under 1,000 Dutch adults, a third of whom were poor as a child. The survey assessed their past and current degree of social exclusion, and their health and psychosocial development, educational career, past family circumstances, etc. In an absolute sense scarring turns out to have been limited during this period: a very large majority of those who were poor or excluded as a child are above the threshold values in adult life. However, the "descendants of hardship" are still more likely to be socially excluded as adults than people who grew up in more favourable conditions. A causal analysis suggests that low educational achievements are the main mediator of scarring risks.

T1  - Moving Pictures? Experimental Evidence of Cinematic Influence on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1667953640; 201510697
AB  - Objectives Media effects research has generally ignored the possibility that popular films can affect political attitudes. This omission is puzzling for two reasons. First, research on public opinion finds the potential for persuasion is highest when respondents are unaware that political messages are being communicated. Second, multiple studies have found that entertainment media can alter public opinion. Together, this suggests that popular films containing political messages should possess the potential to influence attitudes. Methods We develop a laboratory experiment where subjects were randomly assigned to watch a control movie with no political messages, a movie with subtle political messages, or a movie with strong and explicit political messages. Results We find that popular movies possess the ability to change political attitudes, especially on issues that are unframed by the media. Furthermore, we show such influence persists over time and is not moderated by partisanship, ideology, or political knowledge. Conclusions Our key findings suggest that a renewed scholarly interest in the political influence of popular movies is clearly warranted. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study explores the effects of televised presidential debate viewing on young citizens' candidate evaluations and normative democratic attitudes, including political cynicism and political information efficacy. Findings revealed that debate viewing decreases young citizens' political cynicism and strengthens political information efficacy. Longitudinal analysis tracked young citizens' democratic attitudes from pre-debate to post-election, finding that one's political information efficacy intensifies throughout the course of the ongoing campaign, but debates' immediate effect of reducing political cynicism is not sustained as the campaign progresses.

T1  - Prominent Messages in Television Drama Switched at Birth Promote Attitude Change Toward Deafness
AN  - 1513358541
AB  - The study at hand employed a pre- versus posttest experimental design to test the effects of television drama Switched at Birth on viewers' attitudes toward deafness. This program tells the story of two teenage girls (one of whom is deaf) and their struggles to relate to their peers and families after discovering they were switched as newborns. Two hundred eleven female adults completed pre- and postexposure measures utilizing Cooper, Rose, and Mason's (2004) Attitudes to Deafness measure, the items of which were categorized according to thematic dimensions. After exposure to one of three episodes, viewers' attitudes toward deafness significantly improved overall, although significant differences in attitude changes varied by episodes and dimensions. The three thematic dimensions that were most strongly represented in the program (social interaction, deafness as a handicap, and language issues) appeared to show the strongest attitude change. Positive attitude changes were observed on social interaction and deafness as handicap dimensions, which was consistent with program content depicting positive deaf-hearing friendships and capable deaf characters. However, attitudes on the language issues dimension showed a negative shift, possibly due to the way that deaf characters communicated with hearing characters onscreen. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Childhood Emotional Maltreatment Severity Is Associated with Dorsal Medial Prefrontal Cortex Responsivity to Social Exclusion in Young Adults
AN  - 1476180323
AB  - Children who have experienced chronic parental rejection and exclusion during childhood, as is the case in childhood emotional maltreatment, may become especially sensitive to social exclusion. This study investigated the neural and emotional responses to social exclusion (with the Cyberball task) in young adults reporting childhood emotional maltreatment. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated brain responses and self-reported distress to social exclusion in 46 young adult patients and healthy controls (mean age = 19.2±2.16) reporting low to extreme childhood emotional maltreatment. Consistent with prior studies, social exclusion was associated with activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, severity of childhood emotional maltreatment was positively associated with increased dorsal medial prefrontal cortex responsivity to social exclusion. The dorsal medial prefrontal cortex plays a crucial role in self-and other-referential processing, suggesting that the more individuals have been rejected and maltreated in childhood, the more self- and other- processing is elicited by social exclusion in adulthood. Negative self-referential thinking, in itself, enhances cognitive vulnerability for the development of psychiatric disorders. Therefore, our findings may underlie the emotional and behavioural difficulties that have been reported in adults reporting childhood emotional maltreatment.

T1  - Funny, Ha-Ha: The Impact of User-Generated Political Satire on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1494749542; 201403176
AB  - The 2012 election season provided increased opportunities for the collaboration among citizens, new media, and democracy. The 'social media election' saw a rise in online user-generated political content posted to YouTube. These videos, often satirical in nature, were viewed by millions, making the potential impacts from this new form of political communication deserving of inquiry. Using experimental design, this study explored the relationship between user-generated political satire and 'normative' political attitudes. The results revealed that viewing satirical representations of political candidates did not affect individuals' level of political cynicism or political information efficacy; however, perceptions of candidate credibility and favorability were altered.

T1  - Corporal Punishment: Examining Attitudes Toward the Law and Factors Influencing Attitude Change
AN  - 1429630394; 201338927
AB  - There remains considerable societal support for child corporal punishment, despite much research about its ineffectiveness and potential harm to children. We examined attitudes toward Section 43 of the Canadian Criminal Code which gives parents the right to use reasonable physical force for discipline purposes. We also examined attitude change and predictors of this change. Participants (N=212) completed an on-line study, which found that 39.2 % disagreed with ending Section 43. Upon presentation of corporal punishment-related information, the majority (63.8-70.5 %) now indicated being in favor of ending Section 43. Attitude change was highest for information on the potential for child abuse. Socio-demographics (ethnicity, religion), childhood disciplinary experiences (non-punitive discipline), and discipline perceptions (parental warmth/involvement) predicted attitude change. Results indicate that providing information about corporal punishment is key to changing attitudes toward parents' legal right to its use. Also, parental background and childhood discipline characteristics may differentially influence the amount of attitude change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Public attitudes towards privacy and surveillance in Croatia
AN  - 1417524664; 201332721
AB  - This paper investigates public attitudes towards privacy, data protection, surveillance and security in Croatia. The public opinion survey assesses the value privacy may have for the individuals and if privacy is recognized as a social and political value. Four principal groups of privacy violations are covered in the survey: information collection, information processing, information dissemination and invasion. Citizens' awareness of the data protection issues and related confidence in government and business practices are examined as well. Furthermore, this paper investigates if public attitudes towards surveillance in Croatia are in favor of the "nothing to hide" argument. Based on empirical data, the findings indicate that there are three groups of Croatian citizens with different opinions: "pro-surveillance" oriented citizens; citizens concerned about being surveilled; and citizens concerned about data and privacy protection. Identified groups of citizens differ in demographics. Policy implications of the research results are discussed in the paper. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Building social capital among rural, older Australians through information and communication technologies: A review article
AN  - 1364704142; 201326921
AB  - This paper undertakes a comprehensive review of the growing international literature on the adoption and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) among older people. Issues associated with access and adoption of ICTs among older people living in rural communities will be explored, drawing on social capital as a theoretical lens through which to identify how these new technologies can build healthy ageing. ICTs as bridging social capital can address some of the challenges of service provision in rural Australia and provide access to more extensive information and resources. ICTs can also contribute to bonding social capital through access to other forms of communication to build on local connectedness. However, rural, older people face particular challenges of access, which may exacerbate the cycle of rural social exclusion. In the context of the Australian National Broadband rollout, it is timely to consider how some of these disparities can be addressed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cross-Cutting Effects of Hypertext Navigation on the Convergence of Attitudes
AN  - 1667953653; 201510398
AB  - This study explores the navigation patterns of users reading hypertext-linked online news articles about a controversial issue. With the theoretical frameworks of selective exposure and cross-cutting exposure, the study examined the effects of individuals' attitudes on their navigation patterns and consequent attitude changes after the news exposure. We asked 130 participants to read positive or negative news articles about the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) by selecting six consecutive webpages. The results indicate that their attitudes toward the FTA was a significant predictor of their news selection, providing support for the selective exposure hypothesis. In terms of navigation patterns across the six news selection stages, the participants tended to select news articles that corresponded to their initial attitudes. The selection gap between participants with different attitudes increased until the fifth stage and ultimately converged. In terms of attitude change, the gap in the participants' attitudes decreased sharply after their navigation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can Emotion Regulation Change Political Attitudes in Intractable Conflicts? From the Laboratory to the Field
AN  - 1448995463; 201343617
AB  - We hypothesized that an adaptive form of emotion regulation -- cognitive reappraisal -- would decrease negative emotion and increase support for conflict-resolution policies. In Study 1, Israeli participants were invited to a laboratory session in which they were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-reappraisal condition or a control condition; they were then presented with anger-inducing information related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Participants in the reappraisal condition were more supportive of conciliatory policies and less supportive of aggressive policies compared with participants in the control condition. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in responses to a real political event (the recent Palestinian bid for United Nations recognition). When assessed 1 week after training, participants trained in cognitive reappraisal showed greater support for conciliatory policies and less support for aggressive policies toward Palestinians compared with participants in a control condition. These effects persisted when participants were reassessed 5 months after training, and at both time points, negative emotion mediated the effects of reappraisal. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - News Framing and Public Opinion: A Mediation Analysis of Framing Effects on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1567046877; 201435894
AB  - There is no satisfactory account of the psychological processes that mediate a news framing effect. Based on an experimental study (N = 1,537), this article presents a mediation analysis of a news framing effect on opinion, testing for two important mediation processes: belief importance and belief content change. Results show that framing is mediated by both belief importance and belief content, with belief content being the more prominent variable. The extent to which each process takes effect depends on a person's level of political knowledge. Knowledgeable individuals are affected to a greater extent via both belief content and belief importance change. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Coingate effect: The impact of scandal on attitudes toward, state and federal political actors
AN  - 1037878886; 201231969
AB  - What happens when a major, well publicized state-level scandal occurs? Do opinions of federal politicians improve because of relative comparisons to state politicians caught in the scandal? Do attitudes toward all politicians suffer? Little work has been done to investigate about how scandals related to one level of government affect attitudes about political actors at other levels. We investigate what happens when a major and well publicized state-level scandal occurs. Using individual-level public opinion data collected during the summer of 2006, we analyze the impact that a state-level scandal had on citizen approval of state and federal political actors, considering the mediating impact of exposure to media coverage of the scandal. Overall consumption of news coverage of state governors boosts approval of the governor relative to the president. At the same time, however, citizens exposed to negative scandalous news coverage of their governor show a decline in relative gubernatorial approval. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - RE-CREATING THE FAVELA IN O HOMEM QUE COPIAVA BY JORGE FURTADO
AN  - 1232072891
AB  - The Brazilian film director Jorge Furtado's O homem que copiava centers on two plots, both based on accepted social discourses: how to escape lower-middle-class poverty; and the perennial question of the obstacles to love. These two plots are intertwined when the love quest is made to depend on the former, that is, when success in love is predicated on success in social mobility. However, in making the film's protagonist black, Furtado inserts the question of race into these two discourses and highlights the discursive absence of race in dealing with the problems of poverty and race relations. The film underscores the role of education and the discursive implications of social representation in excluding marginalized groups from social mobility while exploring the underside of the mestiçagem myth, the role of race in the question of national identity.

T1  - The consequences of political disagreement in interpersonal communication: New insights from a comparative perspective
AN  - 1037878476; 201232289
AB  - Political disagreement in interpersonal communication increases attitudinal ambivalence and can depress voter turnout. These effects seem to be driven by a wish to avoid social controversy rather than informational gains from encountering other opinions. This article shows that political disagreement in interpersonal communication increases the difficulty of deciding for which party to vote. Moreover, this effect is a result of social disapproval of one's party preference, while political expertise in interpersonal communication has no effect. For voter turnout, no direct effect of social disapproval of one's party preference is found. However, disapproval has an indirect influence on turnout via difficulty of vote choice. In sum, both political attitudes and political behaviour are affected by social pressures. Students of political attitudes and behaviour should try to include interpersonal discussion in their models in greater detail than is common practice today. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Personality traits, political attitudes and the propensity to vote
AN  - 857515437
AB  - Abstract

              
This article examines the link between personality traits, political attitudes and the propensity to vote in elections, using an Internet panel survey conducted in two Canadian provinces at the time of the 2008 federal election and the subsequent provincial elections. It first establishes that the two most proximate attitudes that shape one's propensity to vote are political interest and sense of civic duty. The article then look at specific personality traits (altruism, shyness, efficacy and conflict avoidance) that could affect level of political interest, civic duty and the propensity to vote in elections. In the last part of the analysis, a model is proposed and tested, according to which the impact of personality traits is indirect, being mediated by interest and duty. The article shows that the data are consistent with such an interpretation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary: PROD
AN  - 1928282225
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Rally Effects, Threat, and Attitude Change: An Integrative Approach to Understanding the Role of Emotion
AN  - 743067055; 201043084
AB  - Rally 'round the flag effects (J. E. Mueller, 1970) represent sudden and dramatically powerful situation-specific shifts in attitudes toward the American president. However, the extant literature has yet to fully clarify the nature of the psychological dynamics associated with this effect. These ambiguities reflect fundamental differences of opinion among scholars on some very basic questions such as whether overtly experienced emotion should mediate these attitudinal shifts or whether these changes reflect more general shifts in conservative ideology. Across 4 experiments, the authors sought to gain greater clarity on these and other important matters using a multimethod approach in which the authors varied whether participants viewed documentary footage of the 9/11 attacks (Experiments 1-2), generated autobiographical memories of that event (Experiment 3), or retrieved nonpolitical memories from their past (Experiment 4). The authors discuss the relevance of the present findings for theory and research across a variety of different theoretical and methodological paradigms, including social psychological models of threat, emotional appraisal models, and the political science literature.

T1  - Not Necessarily the News: Does Fictional Television Influence Real-World Policy Preferences?
AN  - 743067373; 201027635
AB  - Scholarly studies of the impact of TV on political attitudes have focused almost exclusively on news & political talk shows. The assumption that political perceptions & policy positions are not affected by fictional programs is challenged. It is noted that many TV dramas draw their plots from real-life events. In addition, those who primarily watch fictional programming tend not to be as informed, partisan, or politically involved as heavy viewers of news/political shows. An experimental design was used to test the hypothesis that narratives suggesting a favorable/unfavorable depiction of some target will influence political attitudes in a certain direction. Data were obtained between January 12, 2005 & January 11, 2006 from questionnaires completed by 86 adults (not students) before & after watching one of two episodes of "Law & Order" that presented a positive & a negative portrayal of the criminal justice system respectively. The methodology is described. The results confirmed that fictional content affect a viewer's political attitude & policy positions. Suggestions are made for future research. Figures, References. J.
