T1  - Maternal Attitudes Toward Child Interethnic Relations in the Netherlands: Facilitating Intergroup Contact Effects?
AN  - 2691407187
AB  - Ethnic diversity and interethnic contact are increasing in Europe. Intergroup contact theory suggests interethnic contact to improve interethnic attitudes, but for young children, parental attitudes toward child interethnic relations might be an important factor determining whether they are exposed to these potentially positive contact effects. This study therefore examined maternal attitudes toward child contact with different ethnic outgroups among 251 mothers (137 White Dutch, 69 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of a 6- to 10-year-old child (M = 7.51, SD = 0.98). Furthermore, associations between maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations and child outgroup rejection were examined, as well as mediation effects of child actual outgroup contact. Neutral to positive maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations were found, with relatively more negative attitudes among Turkish-Dutch than White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers, and toward child relations with Muslims as compared to another outgroup among White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers. Furthermore, results did not indicate that maternal attitudes were related to child actual outgroup contact or child outgroup prejudice and no support for the intergroup contact theory was found. These results suggest that intergroup contact theory does not easily apply, highlighting the need for more research on children in various populations and contexts using different measures and informants. Patterns from the present study suggest that most improvement in terms of maternal attitudes fostering child interethnic relations can be made in the interethnic relations including ethnic groups in the Netherlands that predominantly identify as Muslim.

T1  - Plurality resistance: Effects on intergroup relations and the mediating role of stereotypes
AN  - 2695091142
AB  - We currently seem to witness an increase of right-wing populism, anti-immigration sentiments, and a general hostility towards 'others' in increasingly diverse and complex societies. Based on literature in social, political and psychological sciences, we hypothesize that plurality resistance predicts negative intergroup relations by increasing stereotypes. Using data of a recent, large-scale, and representative survey (N = 2304; 55% females; MAge = 55,19 years), we examined, across different models, whether plurality resistance is associated with anti-Muslim attitudes, mediated via general and gendered Muslim stereotypes. Structural equation models provided evidence for the hypothesized main effect, which was partly mediated by stereotypes, while multigroup mediational models confirmed the robustness of the present findings. Results highlight the usefulness of plurality resistance that contributes to the explanation of negative intergroup relations as well as the important role of stereotypes as cognitive short-cuts for diversity-overwhelmed individuals in order to simplify and, thus, deal with the complexities of contemporary societies.

T1  - When the “Blank Slate” Is a White One: White Institutional Isomorphism in the Birth of National Public Radio
AN  - 2616574969
AB  - A burgeoning literature at the intersection of the sociology of race and organizations explores the organization’s role in (re)producing racial inequalities. The present article builds from this growing literature in its analysis of the formation of National Public Radio (NPR), to better understand how organizational actors translate racialized practices into new organizations at their foundation, even when they seek greater racial inclusivity. I coin a new analytical concept, white institutional isomorphism, to analyze how organizations that embrace a mission of diversity may end up reproducing racially exclusionary practices. White institutional isomorphic pressures are racialized norms that shape the standards and practices adopted across organizations within a given field. Using organizational meeting minutes, external reports, oral histories, and founder memoirs, I show that early implementation of station membership criteria, hiring practices, and programming priorities, while considered race-neutral decisions by the founders that shared a white habitus, inhibited the inclusion of nonwhite voices into NPR’s workforce, station membership, and programming.

T1  - Gender Differences in Anti-Gay Prejudice: Evidence for Stability and Change
AN  - 2596813892
AB  - In recent years, there has been remarkable change in societal acceptance of lesbians and gay men. This meta-analysis explored whether this positive shift has reduced the gender difference in these attitudes. We tested Kite and Whitley’s (1996) gender belief system model and replicated their finding that heterosexual men held more negative attitudes toward gay people (g. = 0.37, k = 245, N = 98,295), gay behavior (g. = 0.22, k = 68, N = 98,734), and gay civil rights (g. = 0.16, k = 80, N = 89,187). We also found that heterosexual men were more likely to report engaging in anti-gay behavior (g. = 0.53, k = 7, N = 2,509), endorsing gay stereotypes (g. = 0.17, k = 17, N = 6,936), and wanting to avoid contact with gay men (g. = 0.49, k = 7, N = 2,178). However, heterosexual women reported a stronger desire to avoid contact with lesbians than did heterosexual men (g. = -0.36, k = 5, N = 1,339). For the most part, gender differences remained stable over time; the exceptions were attitudes toward same-gender sexual behavior and attitudes toward lesbian and gay civil rights, which showed small increases. Gender differences in anti-gay prejudice were mediated by gender differences in traditional gender-role beliefs. Moderator variables included participant group, type of measure, and target group.

T1  - Gamers on Gaming: A Research Note Comparing Behaviors and Beliefs of Gamers, Video Game Players, and Non‐Players
AN  - 2584318392
AB  - Research often conflates video game players and “gamers,” defining gamers by time spent playing or by type of game played. Such operationalization may be a matter of convention or, more problematically, based on stereotypical beliefs about gamers. With a survey of nearly 900 young adults, this study compared self‐identified gamers to other video game players and people who do not play video games. There were behavioral differences in terms of time played, but few attitudinal differences across the groups with regards perceptions of media violence. Non‐players, compared to players and gamers, tended to hold more negative attitudes about video games and their effects. Non‐players also tended to be more socially engaged and have more social support, but gamers were not socially isolated. Notably, hours played did not consistently correlate with beliefs and behaviors. Results demonstrate the importance of recognizing the theoretical, empirical, and practical distinctions among hours played, gamer stereotypes, and gamer identity.

T1  - Do Diversity Awards Discourage Applicants From Marginalized Groups From Pursuing More Lucrative Opportunities?
AN  - 2572841152
AB  - Four studies reveal that offering diversity awards (i.e., awards for applicants from marginalized groups) has unintentionally negative implications for equity. Across the four studies, applicants from marginalized groups were more likely to select the more lucrative award when two unrestricted awards were offered (Study 1: adults from racial groups underrepresented in U.S. colleges who were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, N = 168; Studies 2–4: college women, N range = 152–628). However, the presence of a less lucrative diversity award caused applicants to apply for and prioritize diversity awards over more lucrative unrestricted awards. Fit, or how much applicants felt the award was for someone like them, mediated their increased likelihood of applying for diversity awards over unrestricted awards. These findings suggest that diversity awards may inadvertently siphon applicants from marginalized groups out of application pools for unrestricted awards. Greater examination of unrestricted awards is needed to increase their attractiveness and fit, especially in instances when diversity awards are also offered.

T1  - Racism and pride in attitudes toward confederate symbols
AN  - 2537931130
AB  - In this essay, I describe and evaluate the contemporary debate over support for Confederate icons. This debate is often stylized as “heritage” versus “hatred.” In this debate, one side alleges that their favored Confederate symbols represent pride in Southern‐Confederate identity, whereas the other urges that Confederate symbols represent racial hatred and white supremacy. I argue that the “heritage versus hatred” framing that typifies the public debate and the academic literature is not helpful. Additionally, the literature has largely ignored the views of Black Southerners, who have far more negative attitudes toward Confederate symbols compared to whites. Thus, many works implicitly assume a distinctly white southern past. Together, these shortcomings mean that existing research has likely overestimated overall public support for Confederate symbols and overstated the importance of Southern pride or heritage in informing that support, while at the same time underestimating the extent to which racial animus undergirds pro‐Confederate views among whites.

T1  - From Student to Employee: Group Compatibility Predicts Group Identification and Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 2521296386
AB  - Transitions go along with the need to integrate a previous outgroup into the self-concept. This study examines whether this integration follows cognitive consistency principles. In line with recent theorizing, we test whether the perceived compatibility of a previous and a current ingroup determines identification with these groups and intergroup attitudes. We primed employees who were former students (N = 269) to perceive the groups of students and employees as either more compatible or less compatible, and measured the strength of identification and group attitudes with regard to both groups. The findings largely confirmed predictions. Greater compatibility between social groups increased identity integration and reduced intergroup bias. Identity integration mediated the effect of compatibility on intergroup bias. In line with predictions, the voluntariness of group change explained which of the groups people identified more strongly with when groups were perceived low in compatibility. The results of the study provide evidence that integrating identities into the self-concept follows cognitive consistency principles and suggests that emphasizing similarities between previous and current ingroups fosters identity integration and reduces intergroup bias.

T1  - Is Sexual Objectification and Victimization of Females in Video Games Associated With Victim Blaming or Victim Empathy?
AN  - 2497685905
AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate whether the sexual objectification and virtual violence against females in video games increases negative attitudes toward females, when addressing a variety of noted methodological issues. Study participants were randomly assigned to a control group, where participants played Madden NFL 12, or an experimental group, where participants played Grand Theft Auto. In the experimental group, participants played the game with a confederate, who exposed participants to sexual objectification and violence against females. Study results indicated that both the experimental and control groups had equivalently low levels of rape myth acceptance prior to game play. Immediately after game play, there still was no statistically significant difference in rape myth acceptance between groups; however, there was a decrease in rape myth acceptance for the experimental group. The decrease in rape myth acceptance continued and magnified for the experimental group, over time, to the point of creating a statistically significant difference between the two groups for the follow-up measure at the end of the study.

T1  - Early Maternal Employment Status and Attachment Quality: An Investigation of a Conditional Process Model
AN  - 2476109000
AB  - This study examined how maternal employment status during the first year of a child’s life influenced later attachment quality. A sample of 1,364 mothers participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was categorized into five groups including consistent working, transition to working, transition to nonworking, consistent nonworking, and multiple transitions. Results supported the hypothesized model by showing two interrelated mediating mechanisms of depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity. Mothers who have not worked consistently and experienced transition to nonworking showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when compared with mothers who have worked consistently, which in turn negatively influenced maternal sensitivity. Tests of moderated mediation indicated that among nonworking mothers, only those with negative attitudes toward employment showed lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the consistent working group. Findings suggest different mechanisms involved in the relationship between early maternal employment and the development of secure attachment.

T1  - Policing Right-Wing Extremism in Canada: Threat Frames, Ideological Motivation, and Societal Implications
AN  - 2585486791
AB  - The rise in right-wing extremist activity in Canada is increasingly documented in academic literature, thinktank reports, and news media. Research highlights the rise in right-wing anti-immigrant sentiment, an increase in hate crimes, and the proliferation of online racist activity in Canada. The proliferation of hate groups is inevitable in societies built upon racist institutions of white supremacy and settler colonialism. Here, Crosby examines the rise of right-wing extremism as an object of security knowledge and analysis in Canada.

T1  - Reagan's Cold War on Immigrants: Resistance and the Rise of a Detention Regime, 1981-1985
AN  - 2503461778
AB  - Through migrant and activist testimonies, media coverage, and government documents, this article explores the modes of resistance inside and outside of immigration detention that arose in response to new, more punitive detention policies enacted by the Reagan administration that specifically targeted Caribbean and Central American asylum-seekers in the early 1980s, and the modes of retaliation adopted by the administration in response. It argues migrant detention operates as a form of counter-insurgency, re-centering the geopolitics of asylum within the transnational scope of counter-insurgent warfare and its role in the rise of carcéral trends more broadly. Reagan s "Cold War on immigrants "-defined as a suite of new immigration enforcement measures that was adopted by the Reagan administration during its first term and buttressed the subsequent growth of the detention system- sparked mass resistance. Mounting public dissent against Reagan s foreign and immigration policies, as evidenced by "inside-outside "and transnational activism, Jesse Jackson s J 984 presidential campaign, and the Central America peace and Sanctuary movements, prompted the administration to wage a total war against its opponents to maintain its immigration control and foreign policy aims. The contemporary US immigration detention system emerged, and continues, out of this dialectic of resistance and retaliation.

T1  - Subjective Age in Older Korean Americans: The Impact of Functional Disability Mediated by Attitudes Toward Aging
AN  - 2447808047
AB  - The present study aims to examine how subjective age of older Korean Americans would be affected by functional disability and attitudes toward aging. We hypothesized that (a) both functional disability and attitudes toward aging would have a direct effect on subjective age and (b) the effect of functional disability on subjective age would be mediated by attitudes toward aging. Our analyses of the survey data with 208 community-dwelling Korean Americans aged 60 and older (mean age = 69.6, SD = 7.51) showed that the indirect effect of functional disability on subjective age through attitudes toward aging [–.020 (.009)] was significant (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [–.039, –.006]). The findings suggest that functional disability fosters negative attitudes toward aging, which in turn leads to the feelings of being older than actual age. Our study suggests ways to preserve and promote positive perceptions of age and aging.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Male rape in context: measures of intolerance and support for male rape myths (MRMs)
AN  - 2439261944
AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an ‘everyday life’ context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

T1  - Can the curriculum be a tool to engage pre-service teachers in prevention of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity? A teacher–educator dialogue
AN  - 2460970657
AB  - This article offers a reflexive conversation between three teacher-educators from a South African university, who teach in the Curriculum Studies discipline. We consider how we can use the curriculum to engage pre-service teachers in discussions that might lead to active participation around issues of prevention and changing of attitudes towards gender-based violence (GBV) against people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ+) people. We used a discussion prompt in the form of a newspaper article. Drawing on transcripts of our audio-recorded dialogue we present a brief examination of our interchanges. Through this dialogue, we attempt to develop a shared sense of how we can use the curriculum to begin engaging students in conversations and confrontation of their own prejudices, so they can, in turn, translate that into their own practice as future teachers.

T1  - Right‐wing authoritarianism and majority members’ preferences for minority acculturation
AN  - 2408791361
AB  - The present research examines the role of right‐wing authoritarianism for the formation of majority members’ attitudes towards minority members’ contribution to the acculturation process. Previous research has confirmed the link between right‐wing authoritarianism and majority members’ acculturation preferences. Nonetheless, a test of their longitudinal relationship was still lacking. Using data from a 3‐wave panel study in Germany, we demonstrate that right‐wing authoritarianism among majority members predicts less support for immigrants’ cultural maintenance and less support for the establishment of intergroup relations over time (Study 1, N = 551). Using cross‐sectional survey data, we show that collective threat mediates these relationships (Study 2, N = 817). Data were representative of the German adult population. Our findings indicate that authoritarian majority members oppose integration because they perceive foreigners as threatening. Right‐wing authoritarianism appears to be a meaningful individual difference variable linked to majority members’ attitudes towards immigrants’ maintenance of their heritage culture and the establishment of intergroup relations over time. Our findings complement recent theorizing about acculturation processes.

T1  - From Street Corners to Social Media: The Changing Location of Youth Citizenship in Guinea
AN  - 2376086726
AB  - This study explores social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter in particular, as emergent sites of youth citizenship in Guinea. These need to be understood within a longer history of youth citizenship, one that includes street corners and other informal mediations of youth politics. This counters dominant discourses both within the Guinean public sphere and in academic research that decry Guinean social media practices as lacking, or Guinean youth as frivolous or inconsequential in their online political engagements. Instead, young Guineans’ emergent digital practices need to be approached as productive political engagements. This contributes to debates about African youths by examining the role of digital technologies in shaping young Africans’ political horizons.Alternate abstract:Résumé:Cet article explore les réseaux sociaux, Facebook et Twitter en particulier, en tant que lieux de vie citoyenne pour les jeunes Guinéens qui doivent être resituer dans une trajectoire historique qui comprend les coins de rue et d’autres lieux informels comme sites de médiation de la vie politique. Cela va à l’encontre des discours dominants qui décrient les pratiques numériques de la jeunesse guinéenne comme frivoles, inconséquentes ou déficientes. Plutôt, cet article propose ‘d’aborder ces pratiques comme productives. Finalement, cet article contribue aux débats sur la jeunesse Africaine en rendant compte du rôle du numérique dans l’agencement des horizons politique des jeunesses Africaines.Alternate abstract:Resumo:Neste estudo, analisamos as plataformas das redes sociais, em especial o Facebook e o Twitter, enquanto lugares emergentes de exercício de cidadania por parte da juventude guineense. Estas plataformas têm de ser entendidas no âmbito de uma história mais longa do exercício de cidadania juvenil, contemplando as esquinas de rua e outras vias informais de mediação das políticas de juventude. Esta abordagem contradiz os discursos dominantes quer na esfera pública da Guiné, quer na investigação académica, segundo a qual não existe neste país uma prática de utilização das redes sociais e que acusa os jovens guineenses de serem frívolos ou inconsequentes no seu envolvimento político online. Pelo contrário, as práticas de utilização dos recursos digitais por parte da juventude guineense devem ser encaradas como formas produtivas de empenho político. Assim, através da análise do papel que as tecnologias digitais desempenham na formação dos horizontes políticos dos jovens africanos, pretendemos contribuir para os debates mais alargados acerca das juventudes africanas.

T1  - The Role of Psychological Flexibility as a Mediator Between Experienced Sexual Racism and Psychological Distress Among Men of Color Who Have Sex with Men
AN  - 2127844350
AB  - Previous research has shown that individuals belonging to multiple marginalized groups experience higher levels of psychological distress, which is linked to experiencing discrimination based on their multiple marginalized identities. One way that gay and bisexual men of color face discrimination is in the dating and sexual situations within the men who have sex with men community, which is sometimes termed sexual racism. Previous research has found that experienced discrimination on the basis of their race/ethnicity is positively related to depressive symptoms. The present study examined whether psychological flexibility mediates the effect of experiencing sexual racism on psychological distress. In this study, 439 men of color who have sex with men completed a series of questionnaires online on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results showed that the indirect effects of experiencing sexual racism through psychological flexibility on depression (95% CI .22, .39), anxiety (95% CI .15, .29), and stress (95% CI .18, .33) were significant while controlling for demographic variables. Therefore, this model showed that psychological flexibility mediated and explained the effect of experiencing sexual racism on psychological distress. Clinical implications and future avenues of research are discussed.

T1  - Photographic representations of the society of tiredness and poverty
TT  - Representaciones fotográficas de la sociedad del cansancio y la pobreza
AN  - 2394928755
AB  - Introduction: A hermeneutic analog analysis was carried out on photographs taken by university students from three federative entities of Mexico: Mexico State, Morelia, and Quer taro. The main objective for this research is to analyze the social representations from middle, upper-middle and upper class young undergraduates from Mexico, as a way to frame/perceive the Other, regarding tiredness and poverty. The studied topics were the photographic representations of the society of tiredness and poverty. The purpose was to contrast the social representations from the undergraduates, their ways to frame the Other (that appears to live in tiredness and poverty). Methodology: It consisted of a universe of 210 photographic registers. The methodology was descriptive based on the analog hermeneutics. Results: Predominance of images portraying people who carry out productive handmade and handcrafted activities in public streets. Conclusions: The faces possess a bigger importance when representing poverty, perhaps because it is the most expressive part of the body, while they are adults and not old adults who preponderate on the portraits. The vision of the Other in poverty and tiredness is shared among the undergraduates.Alternate abstract:Introducci n.

Los rostros poseen mayor importancia al representar la pobreza, quizá porque son la parte más expresiva del cuerpo, mientras que son adultos y no adultos mayores quienes preponderan en los retratos. La visión del Otro en pobreza y en cansancio es compartida entre los jóvenes.

T1  - Using intercultural videos of direct contact to implement vicarious contact: A school-based intervention that improves intergroup attitudes: GPIR
AN  - 2302360342
AB  - We aimed to create an engaging and dynamic intervention for schools that uses videos of direct school peer contact to implement a vicarious contact intervention. Participants were ethnic majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high school students (N = 485; age ranging from 14 to 22 years old, Mage = 17.24 years), who were asked to watch and evaluate videos created by peers from their school for a competition for the best video on intercultural friendships. Results revealed that vicarious contact, relative to a control condition where participants were not shown any videos, improved outgroup attitudes, reduced negative outgroup stereotypes, and increased willingness to engage in contact with the outgroup. These effects only emerged when intercultural friendships in the videos were salient. Inclusion of the other in the self, but neither intergroup anxiety nor fear of rejection by the outgroup, significantly mediated the effect of the videos on outcomes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

T1  - Out of place, out of time: towards a more-than-human rhythmanalysis of smoking
AN  - 2289427069
AB  - Geography has in the last two decades showed an increasing interest in smoking and while mainly within the purview of health geographies, some have also utilised Foucauldian concepts of ‘governmentality’ and Goffman’s notion of ‘stigma’ to study smoking’s spatial exclusion and purification of public spaces. More recently, cultural geographers have started to investigate the more embodied, sensory as well as affective elements of smoking. Notwithstanding recent developments, the temporalities of smoking have largely remained unaccounted for, while the more-than-human in smoking has received little sustained attention. This article aims to fill this gap and in doing so intervenes in this body of critical work by developing a framework that can account for the pharmacological and habitual affordances of smoking, without descending into the pathologisation of smoking bodies that has characterised a public health focus on the addictive qualities of nicotine. To develop this framework, the article brings theories of the more-than-human into dialogue with rhythmanalysis, in order to examine the messy human–nonhuman ties through which everyday rhythms of smoking are enacted, embodied and performed. By focusing on the spatio-temporal patterns of two nonhuman elements, nicotine and the cigarette, the aim is to dislodge the human body from the centre of analysis. This conceptual more-than-human rethinking of smoking offers a means to account for the agency and affects of nonhumans in relation to smoking, and addiction more broadly, without slipping back into deterministic, public health understandings of the body.

T1  - Integration, class and secularism: the marginalization of Shia identities in the UK Iranian diaspora
AN  - 2110747226
AB  - Despite ongoing debates about the nature and role of multiculturalism in the UK, the idea of integration remains significant in British immigration policies and community relations, and it orients itself towards second and third-generation diasporans as well as recent arrivals. Drawing on original data from the UK Iranian diaspora, this paper aims to complicate extant debates by exploring the cultural dimensions of integration mainly at the intra-diasporic level. Particularly among secular middle-class UK Iranians, ‘integration’ acts as an idiom for being a ‘good’, ‘successful’, ‘proper’ Iranian, and a failure to integrate is often described as unacceptable and even shameful. Integration in this sense mirrors dominant neo-liberal attitudes and puts huge pressure on Iranians to constantly ‘do better’ in cultural and economic terms to justify their presence in the UK. Crucially, these processes are predicated on a critique and/or rejection of Iranian Shiism and Islam in general, thus helping to marginalize Iranian Shia identities in representations of Iranian-ness in the British mainstream. We argue, therefore, that dominant policies and discourses of integration, regardless of their stated intention, intersect with the multiple and competing realities that exist in a diasporic community to produce particular social and cultural relations which may exclude identities protected under UK law. However, we also draw comparison with the US to suggest that these dynamics might begin to change in the near future.

T1  - Interability Contact and the Reduction of Interability Prejudice: Communication Accommodation, Intergroup Anxiety, and Relational Solidarity
AN  - 2273144440
AB  - Guided by intergroup contact and communication accommodation theories, this study tested the effects of U.S. participants’ (N = 286) communication with their most frequent contact who had a visible physical disability and its effects on attitudes toward and stereotypes of people with disabilities as a whole. As predicted, mediation analysis showed the type of interability contact (i.e., nonfamily = 1 and family = 2), and participants’ perceptions of their own communication accommodation during interability interactions with the contact had significant indirect effects on the improvement of attitudes toward and reduction of stereotypes about people with disabilities through relational solidarity and intergroup anxiety as sequential mediators. In addition, communication accommodation had significant positive direct effects on intergroup attitudes. These findings provide insights into the important role played by interability contact, especially in the family context and communication accommodation in developing positive relationships in order to reduce anxiety, prejudices, and biases toward people with disabilities.

T1  - The Law of Bad Smells: Making and Adjudicating Offensiveness Claims in Contemporary Local Law
AN  - 2307314502
AB  - The sense of smell seems to have resisted the kind of objective measurement process that might have facilitated settling competing claims about offensive smells by applying a general rule or standard. As a result, authorities, including courts,cannot avoid making subjective judgements of taste. A nuisance lawsuit out of Ontario regarding a mushroom farm, or rather its smells, is used here as one source of material about the difficulties of adjudication in this subfield of the “law of the senses.” Attention is also paid to a curious quasi-judicial entity, Ontario’s Normal Farm Practices Protection Board, charged with resolving, mainly through mediation, disputes about farm smells between farmers and non-farming neighbours. Overall, the article shows that the ex post facto, situated and complaint-driven logic of nuisance that nineteenth-century law used to govern offensive noises as well as nasty smells, and which left plenty of room for subjective judgements of taste, keeps reappearing in the present day. Nasty smells seem particularly impervious to modernization, that is to being managed through objective measurement and preventive regulation.Alternate abstract:L’odorat semble avoir résisté au processus de création de mesures objectives où l’on applique une règle ou une norme générale. Ce processus aurait pu faciliter la règlementation relative aux réclamations concurrentes sur les odeurs offensantes. Par conséquent, les autorités, y compris les tribunaux, ne peuvent éviter de porter des jugements subjectifs. Une poursuite pour nuisance, qui se déroule en banlieue de l’Ontario, et se rapportant à une champignonnière, ou plus précisément ses odeurs, est d’ailleurs utilisée dans cet article afin d’illustrer les difficultés dans la prise de décision judiciaire relativement au droit des sens. Une attention particulière est également portée à la Commission de protection des pratiques agricoles normales de l’Ontario, une curieuse entité judiciaire qui est chargée de régler, principalement par la médiation, les différends concernant les odeurs agricoles entre les agriculteurs et leurs voisins non-agriculteurs. Dans l’ensemble, le présent article montre que la logique de nuisance a posteriori, située et fondée sur les plaintes, qui était utilisée dans le droit du XIXe siècle afin de régir les bruits offensants et les mauvaises odeurs, et qui laissait une large place aux jugements subjectifs, ne cesse de réapparaître dans le monde actuel. Les odeurs désagréables semblent, en ce sens, particulièrement insensibles à la modernisation, c’est-à-dire à la gestion par des mesures objectives et à une réglementation préventive.

T1  - Transcultural fandom of the Korean Wave in Latin America: through the lens of cultural intimacy and affinity space
AN  - 2250554164
AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

T1  - Liminality and racial hazing of Muslim migrants: media framing of Albanians in Shepparton, Australia, 1930-1955
AN  - 2204182566
AB  - This article is a historical empirical study of the Albanian Muslim migrant community of Shepparton. Through analysing newspaper reports, the authors discuss how these migrants were portrayed as liminal between their first arrival and acceptance as Australians a generation later. This is characteristic of a practice which the authors term "migrant hazing", where a migrant group is demonized as a threat to the society during the liminal phase. Migrant hazing occurs in public discourse, particularly the media, and ceases with the replacement of the group by newer migrants, who are subjected to the same process. Furthermore, migrant hazing remains present in contemporary depictions of Australian Muslims. In this longitudinal study, media reports on Albanian Muslims revolved around three persistent themes: their supposed criminality, the wrongful use of land and the threat of dual-loyalty. These three items constituted the main weapons of the media in hazing the first, liminal generation.

T1  - PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING OF LOW-INCOME COLLEGE STUDENTS: INTERNAL STRATEGIES AND INSTITUTIONAL BRIDGES
AN  - 2188171281
AB  - Purpose: Low-income (LI) college students face unique challenges in their transitions to college and throughout their college experience. The difficulties of leaving home and learning to navigate unfamiliar environments are exacerbated by LI students' experiences of marginalization and encounters with the class- and race-based deficit discourse held by some students, faculty, and administrators. While many LI students are highly resilient and possess coping strategies, the cumulative experience of these challenges can put LI students under additional stress, detract from their sense of belonging, and reduce their psychological wellbeing, all of which diminish the likelihood of graduating from college. Colleges must build institutional bridges between their structures and the internal characteristics of their LI students, tailoring support systems to foster the unique strengths of those students, increase those students' feelings of belonging, promote their academic success and social integration, and enhance their psychological wellbeing. This study explored the internal and institutional characteristics that LI students utilize to succeed in college and generated a list of recommended institutional bridges. Methods: Ten LI college students of diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds were included in this study. Participants were first-generation and continuing-generation students who varied by gender, religiosity, sexuality, grade, and membership in scholarship cohorts. Two rounds of semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant. Traditional interviews, conducted in fall 2017, explored the college application processes, academic and social transitions to college, family relationships, and current academic, social and work experiences. Participants were also asked about how their experiences were influenced and had an influence on their sense of self. Walking interviews, conducted in spring 2018, explored the importance of three campus locations chosen by participants, focusing on the role of place in mediating identity, belonging, and development over time. Transcribed interviews were qualitatively coded and analyzed using grounded theory. Results: Findings include strategies for adaptation and success that participants implemented across domains of their college experiences to navigate through their institution, enhance their sense of belonging, and foster their psychological wellbeing and development. Participants reported engaging in many types of self-management, including goal-setting and self-regulation; establishing a range of mentoring relationships; becoming social justice advocates; and adapting campus places to meet evolving personal needs. Each strategy requires accessible institutional structures, such as experiential education opportunities; faculty and staff willing to take on mentorship roles; classes and organizations that encourage the analysis of social categories and social forces; and the existence of institutional spaces that students can appropriate as student places. Conclusions: While LI students' strategies and institutional structures vary across colleges, conditions contributing to gaps between the strengths of LI students and qualities of institutional offerings remain similar across institutions of higher education. Our typology of strategies and place can be used to inform the development of guidelines for the construction of institutional bridges based on the strengths, not perceived deficits, of LI students.

T1  - FROM FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION TO COMMUNICATION RIGHTS: MARGINALIZED GROUPS AND FEMINIST PERSPECTIVE
AN  - 2462479020
AB  - Communication rights propose ability and accessibility of mass media for all people so that they can access the means of communication for their rights.Today, when the tools of communication are changing and developing very fast and the centralization and monopoly in media growing rapidly, a question is being raised that, is there a healthy environment so that everyone in society can access their right to freedom of expression? In India, constitution of country has guaranteed the freedom of speech and the Indian Supreme court not only protected this fundamental right but also expended it in the favour of common people.But, the civil society in India either has not emerged strongly or the large part of the society still not ready to secure these rights for all. Many times the echo of the past feudal society and noises of orthodoxy create adverse condition for the freedom of speech to be accessible to all. Actually the main victims of mass media dominance are marginalized groups because they are losing their ability to negotiate in social and political systems. The same thing is applicable for women also. The concern of Beijing agenda is obvious that Media has a male prospective which not questions patriarchy and coverage on women's issue is mainly quantitative, it covers only dominant norms. Still, It is a tough path for communication rights to be a reality.

T1  - Street Children Revisited: Critical Perspectives on Street-Connected Children in a Fragile Zimbabwean Socioeconomic Climate
AN  - 2295417072
AB  - The aim of this article, which is based on a review of theoretical and empirical literature including policy documents, is to explore the socioeconomic situation of street-connected children in Zimbabwe's current socioeconomic turbulence. This article will investigate the extent of deprivation and vulnerability among children who live and work on the streets and the perspective of media coverage of their lived experiences. UNICEF defines street children as boys and girls who are less than eighteen years of age. This definition also distinguishes between two main groups: children on the street, who are street connected but home based,, and children of the streets, who are street based. The solution to the problem of street children lies in transforming the existing social security schemes in order to be robust and proactive toward broad-based coverage for these children. This article will establish the need for appropriate intervention, including the adoption of policies that are relevant to social work practice for enhanced child welfare. Finally, it will offer pathways for enhanced social functioning for street children.

T1  - Understanding Ostracism from an Attachment Perspective: Testing a Moderated Mediation Model
AN  - 2287891176
AB  - The perception of being ostracized in a foreign country is a great obstacle that may lead to international students' strain. The present study aimed to understand ostracism from the perspective of adult attachment. We proposed a moderated mediation model in which attachment anxiety was hypothesized as an antecedent of ostracism and as a moderator of the ostracism - strain links. Participants were 119 international students enrolled at a large public university in U.S. Results largely supported the model, which showed that the attachment anxiety exaggerate the harmful effects of perceived ostracism on depression and physical symptoms. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

TT  - Entornos digitales distribuidos y aprendizaje: Empoderamiento personal y transformación social en colectivos discriminados
AN  - 2162705947
AB  - The role of digital media and learning has often been synonymous with the use of open education resources in formal institutional settings. Further, open and distance learning has been criticized for focusing narrowly on educational objectives, ignoring sociopolitical issues of access and participation by marginalized populations. This study examines the lived experiences of female migrant domestic workers (N=20) in Singapore attending Open University. Mobile and social media supplement open and distance learning resources to allow for open practices of consumption, production and sharing in distributed contexts of digital learning. Marginalized students engaged in participation and collaboration activities, with specific privacy practices due to their social positions. Digital learning led to substantive learning for personal empowerment and social transformation, with aspirational strategies often involving digital skills. The discussion reflects on identity management across formal and informal digital settings as a means of transforming societal discourses of discrimination.Alternate abstract:El rol de los medios digitales y el aprendizaje a menudo ha sido sinónimo del uso de recursos educativos abiertos en entornos institucionales formales. Además, el aprendizaje abierto y a distancia (ODL) ha sido criticado por centrarse estrictamente en los objetivos educativos, ignorando las cuestiones sociopolíticas de acceso y de participación de las poblaciones marginalizadas. Este estudio examina las experiencias de vida de un grupo de trabajadoras domésticas migrantes (N=20) en Singapur que asisten a Open University. Los medios móviles y las redes sociales complementan los recursos ODL para permitir prácticas abiertas de consumo, producción e intercambio en contextos distribuidos de aprendizaje digital. Los estudiantes marginalizados intervinieron en actividades participativas y colaborativas, con prácticas de privacidad específicas de acuerdo a sus posiciones sociales. El aprendizaje digital condujo a un aprendizaje sustantivo para el empoderamiento personal y la transformación social, con estrategias de aspiración que a menudo involucran habilidades digitales. La discusión reflexiona sobre la gestión de identidades en entornos digitales formales e informales como un medio para transformar los discursos sociales de discriminación.

T1  - Attitudes towards Muslims and fear of terrorism
AN  - 2117320047
AB  - This article looks at explanatory approaches of fear of terrorism. Until now, empirical studies looking at determinants of fear of terrorism have used the theoretical framework from the field of research regarding fear of crime. We argue that the cognitive link between terrorism and Islam is currently so strong that explanatory models should include measures of attitudes towards Muslims. On an argumentative level, the fear of crime theoretical framework is unconvincing. Our empirical analysis using structural equation modelling shows that fear of terrorism shares almost no determinants with the fear of violent crime. Negative attitudes towards Muslims are the strongest determinant of fear of terrorism and totally mediate all other effects. Discussions about tackling the issue of fear of terrorism should consider these findings as solutions may otherwise be inappropriate, at best. At worst, solutions based on an improper understanding of the determinants of fear of terrorism may serve only to exacerbate the problem.

T1  - Influences of Media Exposure on Chinese University Students' Attitudes and Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 2043766864
AB  - Research on media influence on attitudes and perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent predictor of IPV, is limited. Using a convenience sample of 2057 Chinese undergraduate students, this survey explored influences of media exposure on attitudes and perceptions of IPV the first time in literature. Significant differences (p < .05) of perceptions of IPV were found between respondents who reported developing cognitions of IPV from books, magazines, or newspapers and those who didn't, with the former having better perceptions than the latter. Positive associations were also found between print-based media access and perceptions and negative attitudes concerning IPV.

T1  - Of witch doctors, traditional weapons and traditional medicine: decolonial meditations on the role of the media after the Marikana massacre, South Africa
AN  - 2126946209
AB  - On 16 August 2012, in an incident that shocked the world, 34 mineworkers were gunned down by police in the mining town of Marikana, South Africa. This article focuses on analyses by the print media and argues that the script adopted is that these men-about-town who spend a large part of their lives servicing global markets are painted as 'traditionalists' because they carried 'traditional weapons' and are said to have consulted traditional healers in a bid to foil attack on themselves. These men who were fighting a struggle which has its roots in global capitalism somehow reverted to being 'traditional'. I argue that this is a historical strategy which is used to undermine the struggles for equivalence waged by those who are believed to inhabit the other side of the line of the human. The script advanced by the media is argued to be self-interested in that it camouflages a number of important issues; that analysis is never neutral and is always for someone and towards some end. It is argued that contrary to mainstream media which amplified differences, the only difference mineworkers should rightfully own is that they bear scars of exploitation and exclusion in the South African mineral mining complex.

T1  - Willingness to Falsely Take Blame among Friends: Closeness, Reporting Wrongdoing, and Identity
AN  - 2035225833
AB  - This study examined people's willingness to falsely take the blame for a friend's offense. We sought to identify whether friendship closeness and individual differences would predict false blame-taking. Participants were randomly assigned to think of either a close or casual friend engaging in driver negligence and indicated their willingness to falsely take responsibility. Although self-construal was unrelated to willingness, oneness mediated the relationship between friendship closeness and blame-taking willingness. Negative attitudes about reporting wrongdoing predicted a greater willingness, and men were more willing to take the blame than women. Results may help those in the legal system to better identify false confessions.

T1  - Investigating the Effects of Media Consumption on Attitudes Toward Police Legitimacy
AN  - 2035225750
AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics.

T1  - The Emergence and Transformations of the World Cup for the Homeless: From the Excitement of Soccer to Managerial Decisions between 2003 and 2012
AN  - 2242756825
AB  - An international football-soccer tournament was initiated for socially excluded homeless individuals in July 2003 and has been held ever since, growing annually in terms of size, competing delegations, media attention and corporate involvement. The aim of the paper is to analyze the initial, historical, journey of this World Cup from its conceptual formation until the end of its first decade (2003-2012). The paper looks particularly at the efforts involved in bringing the concept to life and the challenges the organizers faced before achieving the annual frequency of an event dedicated for wider social purposes. However, also discussed is the use of competitive football formats and the organization of the competition for male and female players. As the tournament has become more successful, it is argued that its overall aim of proposing tools beyond sport for homeless people has been displaced in certain ways. The management orientations, the focus on the trophies, images of excitement, and the corporate agendas have brought sensitive contradictions to its principles of inclusion.

T1  - The symbolic violence of tolerance zones: Constructing the spatial marginalization of female Central American migrant sex workers in Mexico
AN  - 2086367756
AB  - In this paper, we explore how the spatial ordering of sex-work in southern Mexico naturalizes the presence of migrant women in designated “tolerance zones”. Drawing on a feminist approach to ethnographic research in the city of Dominguez, Chiapas, we critically analyze the symbolic powers concealed and enacted through the official discourse of “tolerance” in public health regulations on commercial sex and embodied everyday life of migrant women from Central America. We engage with feminist debates regarding geographies of sex work and oppression to illustrate how tolerance zones mediate and maintain the marginal status of female sex workers who, despite their irregular migration status, are constructed (and view themselves) as bodies in “need of tolerance”. Our analysis of spatial practices that govern tolerance zones illustrates how the discourse of tolerance becomes a vehicle for symbolic violence, naturalizing unequal social relations of power in the lives of migrant Central American women.

T1  - From the margins to the mainstream: making and remaking an alternative music economy in Dar es Salaam
AN  - 1950046843
AB  - Since the arrival in Tanzania of American hip hop recordings in the 1980s, a varied, local, rapped music scene has developed. Due to high import duties, hip hop recordings were available only to wealthier Tanzanians, who consequently formed many of the early rap groups. Following liberalization of the media, however, local music incorporating rapping has become widely popular and the practice of rapping more widespread. Tanzanian rapped music has moved from a largely elite pastime to a ubiquitous form of Swahili language popular culture; from the margins to the mainstream. As rapped music has become increasingly popular it has engendered both local musical stars and maandagraundi or 'underground' rappers. Underground rappers define themselves through their marginalization and exclusion from the circuits of commercial musical production, distribution and dissemination in Dar es Salaam. Unplanned settlements, commonly referred to by the term uswahilini, are fundamental to the practice of underground rapping, providing spaces for underground rapping practice and performance. This article will explore the ways in which underground rappers use the marginal and liminal space of uswahilini to engage in productive, creative practices, arguing that rapping acts as a means through which young men contest their marginality and assert their personhood. Rapping is a space in which young men contest not only their marginality but that of uswahilini - sonically asserting their presence in the city.

T1  - “Pretty Pressure” From Peers, Parents, and the Media: A Longitudinal Study of Appearance‐Based Rejection Sensitivity
AN  - 2296041931
AB  - Drawing from the tripartite sociocultural model of body image, the researchers examined whether direct messages and modeling from peers, parents, and media were concurrently and prospectively associated with appearance‐based rejection sensitivity (appearance‐RS) in young adolescents (Mage = 12.0 years). Appearance‐RS was higher among those who concurrently reported more appearance‐related teasing and pressure by peers, more parent teasing, and greater acceptance of media appearance ideals. In prospective analyses, greater increases in appearance‐RS over 1 year were found for adolescents who perceived higher levels of parental appearance‐related teasing and negative attitudes about their own appearance. Moderation analyses indicated the positive prospective association between parental negative appearance attitudes and appearance‐RS was found in younger but not older participants. Gender did not moderate associations.

T1  - Disempowered by the media: causes and consequences of the lack of media voice of Roma communities
AN  - 1969943577
AB  - Roma communities have experienced widespread historical exclusion in most European countries. The media can be a powerful instrument of a group's inclusion into the mental map of a society, or, on the contrary, it can contribute to the group's exclusion and disempowerment. This article builds on a series of content and discursive analyses of the news media's coverage of Hungarian Roma communities since 1993, interviews with stakeholders and focus group discussions in Roma communities. It scrutinises media reporting about Roma and argues that, in general, the scope and the agenda of Roma's portrayal coincide with mainstream society's stereotypes about the group. The article will additionally look at the media's disempowering role from two perspectives: on the one hand, the extent to which Roma have access to influencing media content, and on the other hand, it will consider the role of minority communities in challenging stereotypical images.

T1  - Crossing the Mediterranean: deterritorialised identities in Perdus entre deux rives, Des vacances malgré tout, and La traversée
AN  - 1952107044
AB  - While the term 'Mediterranean Sea' refers primarily to a geographical category, recent scholarship contends that it is also a 'contested concept' used throughout history for ideological purposes. In the context of the Algeria-France relationship, the Mediterranean constitutes an especially complex entity. This article focuses on the shared visual economy between Algeria and France, and examines varying representations of the Mediterranean in three contemporary documentaries: Oujdi's Perdus entre deux rives, les chibanis oubliés (2014), Bensmaïl's Des vacances malgré tout (2000), and Leuvrey's La traversée (2013). Oujdi's Les chibanis is filmed in Marseille and documents the marginalisation of retired Algerian workers. A reading of the opening and closing images of the Mediterranean suggests that the documentary echoes current political debates on access to French benefits and calls for the inclusion of chibanis within French society. In Des vacances, Bensmaïl films a Paris-based family travelling to Algeria to visit family. In this real-life road-trip, the Mediterranean becomes a spatial questioning of national affiliations. The chronological pace underscores the geographical distance that separates Paris and Algiers, but also the emotional and cultural distance between the father and his family. Leuvrey's La traversée presents the Mediterranean as an actual no-man's land, a transitional space where passengers' voices are liberated. The documentary is fragmented, non-linear and superimposes the verbal/historical over the visual/geographical to challenge exclusive definitions of identity. Ultimately, this article addresses the troubled, intertwined history between Algeria and France by analysing how through changing representations of the Mediterranean, Algerian and French identities are contested and negotiated.

T1  - Religiosity, Cultural Values, and Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Services in Turkey
AN  - 1955238721
AB  - Most research with Muslim populations has been conducted with samples of immigrants living in the West as minority populations. This study investigates how the culture-related variables of family values and self-construal relate to religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services among Muslims living in Turkey, a country where over 99% of the population identifies as Muslim. To examine how these cultural variables may relate to attitudes toward psychological services, Muslim Turks completed a survey which included measures of religiosity, hierarchical and harmonious family values, cultural self-construal, and attitudes toward psychological services. Religiosity was associated with negative attitudes toward psychological services. The relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was fully mediated by hierarchical family values such that when the variable hierarchical family values was added to the model, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was no longer significant. The mediation of hierarchical family values on the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was moderated by independent self-construal, so that independent self-construal weakened the mediation while interdependent self-construal had no effect. The results of this study indicate that among Muslim Turks, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services is more fully explained when culture-related variables are considered.

T1  - (Dis)Enfranchised Intersectionalities: Undocumented Migrant Women and Lesbian Relationships in Angelina Maccarone's Unveiled and Shahar Rozen's Round Trip
AN  - 1965552866
AB  - This article compares the representation of lesbian undocumented women and their relationship with citizen women while highlighting the shifting intersectionalities of vulnerable migrants. Cinematic representations of vulnerable migrations have the potential to reduce distance and create an intimacy and immediacy that makes difficult the task to comfortably accept that people are only members of nameless, faceless groups. Films can, however, also reaffirm stereotypical tropes of victimization and lack of agency through simplifying the migrant experience. The two films discussed here represent different examples of how cinema can be a productive or a reductive means to visualize the largely invisible experience of being lesbian and undocumented.

T1  - Extracurricular Activities in Multiethnic Middle Schools: Ideal Context for Positive Intergroup Attitudes?
AN  - 2296041766
AB  - This study examined processes by which extracurricular participation is linked with positive ethnic intergroup attitudes in multiethnic middle schools in California. Specifically, the mediating roles of activity‐related cross‐ethnic friendships and social identities including alliances with multiple groups were examined in a sample including African American or Black, East or South‐East Asian, White, and Latino youth (N = 1,446; Mage = 11.60 in sixth grade). Results of multilevel modeling suggested that in addition to activity‐related cross‐ethnic friendships, complex social identities mediated the association between availability of cross‐ethnic peers in activities and ethnic intergroup attitudes. Results are discussed in terms of how activities can be structured to promote cross‐ethnic relationships and complex social identities, as well as positive ethnic intergroup attitudes.

T1  - A multimodal discourse analytic approach to the articulation of Martini's "desire" positioning in filmic product placement
AN  - 1859439032
AB  - Product placement constitutes an amply used tactic in a marketer's Integrated Marketing Communications roster. Its merits in circumventing negative attitudes to advertising and in integrating brand values in sociocultural narratives in TV and cinematic filmic discourses have been repeatedly stressed. However, little attention has been placed thus far in the idiosyncratic mode that is scrutinized in this paper, that is product placement by leveraging uncertainty, surprise, postponement and displacement as defining characteristics of the discourse of desire. The analysis of the discourse of desire that unravels in a flirting sequence from the blockbuster movie "Hitch" demonstrates that although the concerned brand (Martini) is minimally visible in the analyzed scene, yet it attains to appropriate as part of its core DNA in "stealth" mode the above characteristics of desire by demarcating the cultural field of flirtation. The offered cultural analytic addresses this idiosyncratic product placement mode by drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis and multimodal discourse analysis.

T1  - COMPETITIVE MEMORIES: THE HOLOCAUST AND THE ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT IN CONTEMPORARY BRITISH CULTURE
AN  - 2066572123
AB  - Recent trends in memory studies have focused on the possibility of creating links between different forms of memory and considering these links as non-competitive. Michael Rothberg (2009; 2011) and Max Silverman (2013) propose a concept of memory that creates a productive comparative framework for understanding different types of memory without, however, creating a hierarchy of suffering between them. In this article, I interrogate the idea of non-competitive memories by focusing on the representation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Marina Lewycka's novel We Are All Made of Glue (2009) and Peter Kosminsky's mini-series The Promise (2011) in light of how the Holocaust and the British Mandate in Palestine are remembered in the UK. Offering close readings of the narrative strategies used to engage with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in these works, I argue that Israel/Palestine can be seen as a litmus case to show that even though, in theory, Rothberg's and Silverman's concepts of memory are able to avoid a competition of suffering, in practice the Holocaust is still perceived as a validation of exclusive Jewish rights to territorial sovereignty in metropolitan discourses, thus often overriding the Palestinian history of suffering as well as Palestinian claims to a national homeland.

T1  - ATTITUDE OF EDUCATED URBAN YOUTH TOWARDS RAPE MYTHS
AN  - 1916318067
AB  - Pakistan, being a signatory to almost all international conventions on human rights, stands committed to ending violence against women. Additionally, various national progressive legislation and policies for the protection of women' rights have been initiated during the last couple of years, but the statistics of cases of violence against women in Pakistan are bothersome. Women enduring this agony and mortifying experience may have to face all sorts of negative attitudes of people around them. This study investigated gender differences among university students in their perceptions towards rape myths about female rape victims. Students' perceptions were measured using the indigenous Rape Myth Scale by collecting data from 385 students from the three universities of Lahore. Additionally, information about the demographics of students regarding academic disciplines, residential areas and socio-economic backgrounds of families were also collected. Data was analyzed by using the t-test and ANOVA. The results revealed a significant gender difference in the perception of respondents, all of whom were educated about rape myths. Male students were found to believe more strongly that a woman's willingness is present in rape, women's strong character would prevent them from getting raped, and women's behaviour and dress attracted rapists. Furthermore, the results indicated that academic discipline, residential city and parental socioeconomic background of students were found to play an influential part in determining their perceptions towards rape myths. The findings imply a need to incorporate a gender-sensitive education programme as a part of the curriculum across disciplines at the university level, in order to nurture gender sensitization in society. In this regard, parents, teachers and media, along with policymakers, can play a meaningful role in curbing the incidence of rape by transforming the social mindset of blaming the rape sufferer.

T1  - Constructing immigrants in UK legislation and Administration informative texts: A corpus-driven study (2007-2011)
AN  - 1856412193
AB  - Research has shown that immigrants tend to be negatively constructed in the discourse of the media. In the context of the European Union (EU), British newspapers reportedly offer largely negative or partial constructions of these individuals. These representations contribute to jeopardizing the integration of this group of people, as their social construction reflects and influences the attitudes of EU citizens and the immigration policies. Our research examines the collocational profile of the lemma 'migrant' in the UK legislation and UK Administration informative texts from 2007 to 2011. While our results show that the UK Administration avoids an explicit negative construction of immigrants coming to the United Kingdom, we have found that they are partially constructed as a homogeneous, well-categorized group through an extremely limited set of lexical items that tend to prime their adscription to tiers. We argue that the representation of immigrants in the legislation points to the fact that UK laws and official information during the period 2007-2011 were more focused on legitimating the control over this group of individuals than on creating the conditions for better integration policies.

T1  - The associations between body dissatisfaction, body figure, self-esteem, and depressed mood in adolescents in the United States and Korea: A moderated mediation analysis
AN  - 2046620388
AB  - The perception of one's body image becomes particularly important in adolescence. Body dissatisfaction has been associated with negative psychological functioning, such as self-esteem and depression. Previous findings showed that the decreased self-esteem due to body dissatisfaction explained the association between negative attitude toward body and psychological well-being in different cultural contexts. The present study examined adolescents from the US (N = 1002) and Korea (N = 3993) and replicated and extended the previous findings regarding body dissatisfaction and associated psychological outcomes. The results showed that body dissatisfaction predicted higher depressed mood and that self-esteem mediated this association for both American and Korean adolescents. Notably, the indirect effect of body dissatisfaction and perceived body image on depressed mood via self-esteem was greater for American adolescents than for Korean adolescents. The implications of the cultural difference in the significance of self-esteem in mediating the body dissatisfaction and depressed mood are discussed.

T1  - Interethnic bridging social capital and the significance of ethnocentric interethnic interaction within Malaysian universities
AN  - 1963401115
AB  - This article explores the possible theoretical relationships of ethnocentrism (independent variable) and interethnic interaction (mediating variable) with interethnic bridging social capital (IBSC) (dependent variable). Interethnic bridging social capital is extremely noticeable that there is a lack of such investigation in specifically Malaysian public universities. In an attempt to clarify the current situation, a survey questionnaire was conducted with 343 undergraduate students from the three main ethnic groups. The findings reveal that not only ethnocentrism can effect directly and negatively on IBSC, but also its impact can be partially mediated through interethnic interaction as well. Overall, this article contributes to our understanding of how negative attitudes towards outsiders inhibit trust, reciprocity and cooperation in heterogeneous communities.

T1  - Collective Self-Esteem and Depressive Symptomatology in Lesbians and Gay Men: A Moderated Mediation Model of Self-Stigma and Psychological Abuse
AN  - 1827659489
AB  - The context of stigma, in which lesbians and gay men live in most countries, exposes them to possible discrimination and promotes the internalization of negative attitudes about their own sexual orientation, which may have negative consequences for their mental health. Their psychological distress may increase when lesbians and gay men are exposed to other sources of stress such as intimate partner violence. With the aim of analyzing the relationship between these variables, this study intends to present a moderated mediation model that proposes: (a) self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology; (b) receiving psychological abuse within same-sex couples moderates the relationship between self-stigma and depressive symptomatology. For this purpose we conducted an online survey with a sample of 357 Spanish lesbians and gay men. Our findings show that self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, participants who had higher levels of self-stigma and received more psychological abuse by the partner showed stronger negative effects on depressive symptomatology. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people
AN  - 1817003843
AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention--in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N=105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

T1  - Social inclusion and the Fatosphere: the role of an online weblogging community in fostering social inclusion
AN  - 1795450943
AB  - Overweight and obesity are one of the most salient issues within society today, and the stigmatisation of overweight individuals is prevalent and widespread. Utilising interviews with 44 individuals who blog within an online fat acceptance community known as the Fatosphere, participants' perceptions of inclusion and exclusion were examined within their offline and online environments. Additionally, the effect this had on their offline lives was examined. Participants described a profound sense of exclusion within their offline lives through three agencies: the medicalisation of 'fatness', the weight loss industry and the media, which echoed descriptions of moral judgement. Furthermore, a sense of inclusion was described within the Fatosphere through the protection and support that they found within this 'safe space'. The effects of the Fatosphere influenced their lives in both negative and positive ways, allowing them to better deal with stigma and discrimination, but sometimes effecting their offline relationships in a negative manner. The Fatosphere provides a unique opportunity for corpulent individuals to engage in a community that is removed from the prominent weight-related discourse within modern society.

T1  - Sexualized Avatars Lead to Women's Self-Objectification and Acceptance of Rape Myths
AN  - 1752994178; 201601733
AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

T1  - Group-based discrimination, national identification, and British Muslims' attitudes toward non-Muslims: the mediating role of perceived identity incompatibility
AN  - 1685140999
AB  - In two studies, we tested a model in which the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim (identity incompatibility) was expected to mediate between group-based discrimination and the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims. In Study 1 (N = 76), anti-Muslim discrimination was associated with lower national identification and more negative attitudes toward non-Muslims, and these relationships were mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. In Study 2 (N = 70), we additionally found that anti-Muslim discrimination predicted stronger endorsement of Islamic group rights, and this relationship was also mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. The studies highlight the importance of group-based discrimination in shaping the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim, and, in turn, the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims.

T1  - Will I Ever Think I'm Thin Enough? A Moderated Mediation Study of Women's Contingent Self-Esteem, Body Image Discrepancies, and Disordered Eating
AN  - 1700673229; 201528212
AB  - Low levels of global self-esteem have been shown to be associated with disordered eating such that individuals who possess more negative attitudes about themselves tend to report more disordered eating symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether appearance-based contingent self-esteem (i.e., the degree to which individuals base their self-esteem on their physical appearance) and actual-ideal body image discrepancies influence this association. This goal was accomplished with a sample of 877 college women who completed measures of global self-esteem, body image, appearance-based contingent self-esteem, and eating behaviors. A moderated mediation analysis showed that actual-ideal body image discrepancies mediated the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating and that this simple mediation was further moderated by appearance-based contingent self-esteem. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the ways in which actual-ideal body image discrepancies and appearance-based contingent self-esteem influence the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating. Future research aimed at improving intervention and prevention of eating disorders should address the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on their appearance and consider whether reducing appearance-based contingencies of self-worth may protect individuals from developing patterns of disordered eating.

T1  - Let's get real about the 'riots': Exploring the relationship between deprivation and the English summer disturbances of 2011
AN  - 1700673180; 201527970
AB  - Despite media and political rhetoric to the contrary, there is persuasive evidence to suggest an association between deprivation and those involved in the English riots of 2011, which continues to be downplayed when developing responses to crime and crime prevention policy. This study explores empirical evidence from two major cities in the North West of England, which highlights an association between deprivation and rioting in both criminal charge and sentencing data allowing further exploration of some of these issues. The paper argues that to mask the rioting as 'mindless criminality' is to ignore wider social-structural inequalities and to silence important messages contained in the rioting behaviour from disenfranchised youth and communities about the inequalities they suffer.

T1  - Davabirzhaot! Conflicting claims on public space in Tbilisi between transparency and opaqueness
AN  - 1735658732; 201538290
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the form of young male socialisation referred to as birzha, in its relation to public space in Georgia. Birzha defines a group of young men who meet regularly in urban open spaces in Tbilisi's neighbourhoods. Partly considered as the initial step of a criminal career, belonging to birzha is a mark of identification with one's local group. The contested nature of public space is illustrated by the conflicting relation between birzha's bottom-up use of public space and top-down projects of urban renovation sought by Saakashvili's government. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon literary and media sources, and analysing fieldwork data collected in 2008-2009 and 2014, this study explores how the announced (re)construction of public space under Saakashvili resulted in institutional interventions from above which curtailed public space's accessibility. Findings - The present analysis points out contradictions in Saakashvili's government's political narrative on public space. In the institutional focus on a future of order, transparency, and democracy, birzha is an insistent reminder of an informal and corrupted past. Banned from futuristic projections of the public space, in the present birzha is annihilated by state repression, enforced in opaque zones out of public sight. Originality/value - Focusing on a largely overlooked phenomenon in social science research, the paper highlights the ways in which conflicting approaches to public space affect the relation between political institutions and citizens. Delving into ambivalent public/private divides in post-socialist societies, the study of Georgian birzha offers an original angle for investigating the contestation of urban public space in relation to political legitimacy and transparency.

T1  - Friendships and outgroup attitudes among ethnic minority youth: The mediating role of ethnic and host society identification
AN  - 1735657216; 201537003
AB  - This study investigates among ethnic minority adolescents how friendships with ethnic minority and majority group peers are related to their attitudes towards the majority outgroup. Friendships with majority group peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through host society identification. Friendships with ethnic ingroup peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through ethnic ingroup identification. Hypotheses were tested longitudinally among ethnic minority adolescents (n = 244) who recently entered middle schools in the Netherlands. Lagged structural equation models showed that friendships with majority group peers were related to stronger identification with the host society which was in turn related to improved attitudes toward the majority outgroup. Ingroup friendships and ingroup identification was not related to outgroup attitudes. Additional analyses indicated that the relation between host society identification and majority group friendships was bidirectional. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Homohysteria: Useful Construct? Or an Unnecessary Splitting of Hairs?
AN  - 1680154409; 201517810
AB  - In this commentary to McCormack and Anderson (2014, this issue), I offer my reaction to a relatively new construct-homohysteria-that characterizes heterosexual men's negative attitudes and affective reactions toward gay men in the context of gendered (traditional) behaviors. I propose that similar to other forms of 'isms' used in both academia and the general community (e.g., racism, sexism), little is to be gained by continuing to splinter established terms such as heterosexism or homophobia. More specifically, I argue that by creating new terms for prejudice against gays and lesbians-terms that simply reflect either different degrees or motives of heterosexism-we risk muddling research findings and ultimately trivializing the pernicious phenomenon of prejudice and discrimination against the LGBT community. I also argue that in the absence of empirical support for the validity of homohysteria (as a distinct construct from heterosexism or homophobia), those embracing this new term are investigatively putting the cart before the horse.

T1  - Benefits and barriers to sports participation for athletes with disabilities: the case of Malaysia
AN  - 2059577236
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to explore the benefits and barriers influencing participation for athletes with disabilities from a developing country (Malaysia). Two independent studies were undertaken: Study 1 included a sample of 123 athletes (95 males, 28 females) who participated in the 2006 Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC Games); Study 2 involved focus group discussions with 14 elite athletes. The athletes ranged in age from 15 to 59 years. Data were collected through a questionnaire (Study 1) and focus group discussions (Study 2). The primary reasons for participation in sport were achievement/challenge (58%) and competency/skill development (41%). The main barriers faced by the athletes were structural (facilities, equipment, funding) and the negative attitude from the government, public and media. However, despite these difficulties the majority of athletes were keen to continue to compete. Further work is required to ensure athletes with disabilities are provided with similar opportunities to athletes without disabilities.

T1  - Uncertainty, Threat, and the Role of the Media in Promoting the Dehumanization of Immigrants and Refugees
AN  - 1494750774; 201402863
AB  - Immigration policies and the treatment of immigrants and refugees are contentious issues involving uncertainty and unease. The media may take advantage of this uncertainty to create a crisis mentality in which immigrants and refugees are portrayed as 'enemies at the gate' who are attempting to invade Western nations. Although it has been suggested that such depictions promote the dehumanization of immigrants and refugees, there has been little direct evidence for this claim. Our program of research addresses this gap by examining the effects of common media portrayals of immigrants and refugees on dehumanization and its consequences. These portrayals include depictions that suggest that immigrants spread infectious diseases, that refugee claimants are often bogus, and that terrorists may gain entry to western nations disguised as refugees. We conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for understanding how uncertainty may lead to dehumanization, and for establishing government policies and practices that counteract such effects.

T1  - Explicit and implicit attitudes of Scottish and Maltese children to national identity
AN  - 1373430246; 201329751
AB  - This paper utilised a combination of explicit and implicit techniques to investigate the ways in which children aged 5-16 from two small European nation-states develop in-group favouritism, and positive and/or negative attitudes towards other nation-states. The study adopted a combination of data collection approaches to gain greater evaluation of variability in the responses obtained. Data were analysed statistically for both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings show self-regulation of overt negativity and clearly demonstrate some disquieting outcomes. It poses questions of the extent to which social norms of xenophobia and racism disseminated to children through access to an adult directed media; and what interventions might diminish out-group negativity and prejudice whilst maintaining a level of in-group favouritism that delivers personal self-esteem, and provides the basis for national regard that does not compromise the rights of others.

T1  - Perceptions of smokers influence nonsmoker attitudes and preferences for interactions
AN  - 1433109347
AB  - In two studies, we examined nonsmokers' perceptions of smokers and consequences of the perceptions. In Study 1, smokers answered questions about their sense of self, dependence on smoking, and motivation to quit. Nonsmokers answered questions about their perceptions of these characteristics. Differences between smokers' self-descriptions and nonsmokers' perceptions were observed. Study 2 asked nonsmokers to judge two types of smokers for which the descriptions were based on Study 1 findings. Results showed that nonsmokers held a more negative attitude about and were less willing to engage in different close relationships with the smoker who was described in terms of nonsmokers' perceptions rather than smokers' reports. Attitude mediated the relationship between type of smoker and willingness to date a smoker.

T1  - Mortality salience and uncertainty: Similar effects but different processes
AN  - 1429629368; 201335604
AB  - Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Remote living: Exploring online (and offline) experiences of young people living in rural areas
AN  - 1364702062; 201323652
AB  - This article investigates the online and offline experiences of young people living in rural communities. It draws upon data from the AHRC-funded research project, 'Young people's creative understanding of their mediaworlds' (2008-10), in which young people aged 14-15 created 'identity boxes' to explore the place of media in their lives. The article demonstrates that many young people in rural areas were disengaged with new media and highlights why, for some individuals, online inclusion increased their feelings of cultural exclusion. The article reveals that many young people in rural areas made use of new media technologies only when they saw them as having a practical value relevant to their lives. The article further demonstrates the use of a creative visual method as a process which elicits reflective comments about a taken-for-granted world, and contributes empirically to knowledge about young people's uses of new media within their everyday lives.

T1  - SANDRA WILLSON: A CASE STUDY IN LESBIAN IDENTITIES IN 1950S AND 1970S AUSTRALIA
AN  - 1700673908; 201524793
AB  - In 1959, a young Sydney lesbian, Sandra Willson, shot and killed a taxi driver as a form of protest against social attitudes toward lesbianism. She spent 18 years in prisons and psychiatric hospitals before her release in 1977. Taking Sandra Willson as a case study, this article will explore the ways in which social disapproval of lesbianism was expressed in 1950s Sydney and the impact this had on women's lives, relationships and identities. By the time of Willson's release in the late 1970s, Sydney represented a very different place in which to articulate a lesbian identity; a place in which same-sex desire was beginning to be acknowledged in the press and in cultural media, and where feminist and gay activists were challenging long-standing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Sandra Willson's experience offers an opportunity to trace shifting notions of lesbianism between the 1950s and the 1970s in Sydney and to consider how these broader patterns of cultural change might have impacted on individual women.

T1  - Screening in or out? Selective non-surveillance of unwanted humanity in EU cities
AN  - 1667953094; 201511444
AB  - In Surveillance Studies, routinized surveillance systems are often regarded as public (and corporate) interference in the private lives of citizens. On the other hand, it is often recognised that surveillance of citizens is also often the counterpart of fundamental rights being guaranteed by the state, especially in fields of economic and social rights. Non-surveillance, and highly selective surveillance can thus be counterparts of efforts to exclude some urban residents from the 'right to have rights' in the first place. This paper considers how selective in- and out-screening of undocumented people in EU cities can produce regularised human rights abuses. Only punitive surveillance is routine in the case of this group of the population. Starting with the 2002 EU Directive 'Strengthening the Penal Framework to Prevent the Facilitation of Unauthorised Entry, Transit and Residence', across the EU the goal of policy has been to remove those redefined as unwanted or surplus humanity. The urban dispossessed are denied even the most basic rights through selective out-surveillance and non-collection of data, including, for example, the right to housing, healthcare, education and employment. At the heart of such selective non-surveillance and punitive screening-out is the deterrence logic of immigration policies across the EU. Data about the everyday lives of the undocumented is lacking, and even where there is such data it is not being fed into policy making at national and urban government levels. Undocumented people end up in the parallel economy, and on the streets, being 'caught' up in illegality, liable to the most punitive forms of screening-out surveillance. They are thus liable to detention, imprisonment and deportation. Self-exclusion, avoidance of public institutions, including schools, medical care and migrant support organisations, can be the result of such punitive screening-out. Redefined as 'unwanted humanity', about whom data is not even systematically collected, undocumented people are a 'target group' for policing, the media and law and order policies. Their selective non-surveillance is thus a strong indicator of their unwantedness. We illustrate our argument using examples from UK, The Netherlands and France. The article suggests that broad and general surveillance of all populations within the EU needs to be recognised as a public good for which states should be held accountable. .

T1  - Why are religious people happy? The effect of the social norm of religiosity across countries
AN  - 1429629644; 201337709
AB  - Drawing on social norms theories, we suggest that religiosity substantially increases subjective well-being if it is considered normative in a certain national context. In Study 1, we test this hypothesis using an indicator of a country's social norm of religiosity that includes both the national level of religiosity and the social desirability of religion. The results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average happier and more satisfied with life than non-religious individuals. This effect is stronger in religious countries with dominant negative attitudes towards non-believers. In Study 2, we further examine whether the differences in social recognition of religious and non-religious individuals in countries where religiosity is normative account for this finding. The results of a moderated mediation analysis indicate that in religious countries, religious people report being treated with more respect, which partially explains their higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction.

T1  - Three decades of populist radical right parties in Western Europe: So what
AN  - 1283642735; 201304718
AB  - The populist radical right constitutes the most successful party family in postwar Western Europe. Many accounts in both academia and the media warn of the growing influence of populist radical right parties (PRRPs), the so-called 'verrechtsing' (or right turn) of European politics, but few provide empirical evidence of it. This lecture provides a first comprehensive analysis of the alleged effects of the populist radical right on the people, parties, policies and polities of Western Europe. The conclusions are sobering. The effects are largely limited to the broader immigration issue, and even here PRRPs should be seen as catalysts rather than initiators, who are neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the introduction of stricter immigration policies. The lecture ends by providing various explanations for the limited impact of PRRPs, but it is also argued that populist parties are not destined for success in opposition and failure in government. In fact, there are at least three reasons why PRRPs might increase their impact in the near future: the tabloidisation of political discourse; the aftermath of the economic crisis; and the learning curve of PRRPs. Even in the unlikely event that PRRPs will become major players in West European politics, it is unlikely that this will lead to a fundamental transformation of the political system. PRRPs are not a normal pathology of European democracy, unrelated to its basic values, but a pathological normalcy, which strives for the radicalisation of mainstream values.

T1  - Vindictive but vulnerable: Paradoxical representations of women as demonstrated in internet discourse surrounding an anti-rape technology
AN  - 1347782388; 201322549
AB  - Much media interest surrounded a campaign to raise funds to distribute 30,000 Rape-aXe condoms to women during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The barbed device is worn inside the vagina and attaches to a penis upon penetration. This paper presents an analysis of popular attitudes towards women and rape as identified from comments made upon online news websites and popular blogs in response to this technology. Two over-arching representations emerged; first, that the Rape-aXe would be employed as a weapon for vengeance and deceit, and second, that it was a means of helping women negotiate risk. We argue that such paradoxical representations of women as simultaneously vindictive and vulnerable make problematic the utility of such an anti-rape device. We suggest that the cultural entrenchment of stereotypical and negative attitudes towards women needs to be recognized and counter-acted upon before rape intervention measures, like the Rape-aXe, can have any positive effect.

T1  - "Coming Clean" on Duty of Care: Australian Print Media's Representation of Male Versus Female Sex Offenders in Institutional Contexts
AN  - 1081613903
AB  - Public opinion about sexual abuse of minors is greatly shaped by mass media and the way individual cases are reported. This paper examines Australian print media's representation of sex offenders, focussing particularly on the sex of the offenders and aiming to shed light on some of the misconceptions and deep-rooted prejudices within the population at large. Given the multi-faceted nature of sexual offences, this paper focuses on sexual offences committed by both males and females against minors in the context of a companion breach of duty of care. In order to explore the effect that linguistic tools can have in the Australian print media's way of reporting sexual abuse cases, twenty-nine newspaper articles published in Australian dailies were selected for analysis. The analysis of these articles reveals a marked bias in the manner in which sexual offences perpetrated by males, as opposed to females, are reported, suggesting a male monopoly on sexual abuse. We argue that this biased representation, which hinders adequate profiling of sexual offences against minors, may stem from an androcentric view of sexuality and from the systematic denial of female agency when it comes to sex.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Positive Female Role-Models Eliminate Negative Effects of Sexually Violent Media
AN  - 1650148285; 201503755
AB  - Much debate has focused on the potential negative role of sexualized violent media on viewer attitudes toward women. One potential issue in previous literature is that depictions of sexuality and violence were confounded with subordinate depictions of female characters. The current study addressed this by randomly assigning young adults to watch either neutral media or sexually violent media with either subordinate or strong female characters. Women who watched sexually violent media were more anxious, and males who watched sexually violent media had more negative attitudes toward women, but only when female characters were subordinate. Sexual and violent content had no influence on viewer attitudes when strong female characters were present, suggesting these are not the crucial influence variables. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Is an outgroup member in need a friend indeed? Personal and task-oriented contact as predictors of intergroup prosocial behavior
AN  - 1315600210; 201307390
AB  - Intergroup contact, particularly close personal contact, has been shown to improve intergroup relations, mainly by reducing negative attitudes and emotions toward outgroups. We argue that contact can also increase intergroup prosocial behavior. More specifically, we predict that different forms of contact will differentially impact on prosocial behavior directed at individual outgroup members and outgroups as a whole. Data of two studies (N1 = 264, N2 = 185), conducted with workgroups in two organizations, show that personal contact is a better predictor of prosocial behavior directed at individual outgroup members, whereas task-oriented contact is a better predictor of prosocial behavior directed at an outgroup as a whole. Additionally, Study 2 provides evidence that empathy mediates the path from personal contact to individual-directed prosocial behavior, whereas reward (but not cost) considerations mediate the path from task-oriented contact to outgroup-directed prosocial behavior. Implications for research on intergroup contact and prosocial behavior are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System
AN  - 1504422371; 201407823
AB  - Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Student and teacher perceptions of school involvement and their effect on multicultural education: a Catalonian survey
AN  - 1322718480; 201312385
AB  - In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

T1  - A Nationwide Study of Norwegian Beliefs About Same-sex Marriage and Lesbian and Gay Parenthood
AN  - 1221408406; 201245919
AB  - In Norway, a gender-neutral Marriage Law that secured equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples took effect in January 2009. The aim of the current study was to explore Norwegian beliefs about equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples and the welfare of children with lesbian and gay parents. A sample of 1,246 Norwegians participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire. The majority reported that they were supportive of equal marriage rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples, whilst there was less support for granting gay and lesbian couples equal right to become parents. The negative attitudes towards equal parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples were explained mainly by concerns about the welfare of children growing up with gay and lesbian parents.

T1  - Race, Immigration, and Policing: Chinese Immigrants' Satisfaction with Police
AN  - 898419872
AB  - A considerable body of research focuses on racial and ethnic minorities' perceptions of police, yet non-Black, non-Hispanic minority groups, Asians in particular, are largely overlooked. Meanwhile, despite a fast growing immigrant population and the increasing demand on local police to enforce immigration law, research on police-immigrant relations remains limited. Using data from over 400 Chinese immigrants, this study examines the issues of race/ethnicity, immigration, and policing with a focal concern on Chinese immigrants' attitudes toward police. Results indicate that the majority of Chinese immigrants rate police positively in overall performance and specific areas of effectiveness, integrity, and demeanor. Both universal and immigrant-specific factors are important predictors of immigrants' attitudes. Chinese immigrants' evaluations of police are not only affected by exposure to media coverage of police misconduct, neighborhood conditions, and city context, but also are intertwined with their opinions of their home country police and perceptions of US immigration authorities.

T1  - Emotional distress about weight gain and attitude to goal achievement failure as predictors of self-regulatory efficacy: Does ethnicity make a difference?
AN  - 1928272535
AB  - In spite of alarming increases in obesity, little is known concerning the influence of emotional distress about weight gain on perceived self-efficacy in maintaining self-control when controlling for racial identity. This study found that emotional distress toward goal achievement failure mediated the influence of ethnicity on perceived self-efficacy in resisting eating temptations. White females reporting higher emotional distress about weight gain than their black counterparts displayed lower self-regulatory efficacy, particularly when negative emotions were involved. Negative attitudes toward goal achievement failure among whites played a critical role in undermining perceived self-regulatory efficacy. The implications for public policy are discussed.

T1  - Is anal sex a marker for sexual risk-taking? Results from a population-based study of young Croatian adults
AN  - 1030869079; 201229645
AB  - Background: There is evidence that anal sex is becoming increasingly popular among heterosexual women and men. Several studies carried out in especially vulnerable populations (e.g. sex workers and low-income youth) suggested that anal sex may indicate a more general propensity to sexual risk-taking. Methods: To assess whether this epidemiologically important finding holds in the case of young adults from the general population, we analysed data from a cross-sectional probability survey carried out in 2010 on 1005 Croatian women and men aged 18-25. Results: Anal intercourse was reported by 36.5% of 86l sexually experienced participants (42.7% of men and 29.8% of women). About one-third of them (34%) used a condom at most recent anal intercourse. The experience of anal sex was significantly associated (P< 0.001) with all four indicators of sexual risk-taking (condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse, number of sexual partners in the past year, concurrent sexual relationships and anonymous sex in the past year), as well as with negative attitudes and beliefs about condom use (P< 0.01). Sexual sensation-seeking mediated the relationship between anal sex and some of the sexual risk-taking behaviours. Conclusion: According to the findings, heterosexual anal sex is directly and indirectly associated with increased behavioural risks of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STI). Sex education and STI prevention programs should focus on the importance of using protection when practicing anal sex. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reconsidering Hispanic Gang Membership and Acculturation in a Multivariate Context
AN  - 1928270722
AB  - Previous qualitative research has suggested that Hispanic gang membership is linked to the process of acculturation. Specifically, studies have indicated that those who are less assimilated into mainstream American or "Anglo" society are at greater risk for joining gangs. Building on these observations, this study examines the relationship between acculturation and gang membership within a theoretically and empirically informed multivariate framework. Based on a sample of Hispanic adolescents residing in the American Southwest, results largely supported previous qualitative studies that have suggested that a number of factors, including acculturation, are necessary to an understanding of gang membership within this demographic. Findings from logistic regression analyses indicated that respondents' grade in school, neighborhood drug availability, level of ethnic marginalization, and level of acculturation were all significantly associated with self-reported gang membership. Results also suggested that marginalization may partially mediate the effects of acculturation.

T1  - Decisions for Others Are More Creative Than Decisions for the Self
AN  - 1928274987
AB  - Four studies investigate whether decisions for others produce more creative solutions than do decisions for the self and if construal level explains this relation. In Study 1, participants carried out a structured imagination task by drawing an alien for a story that they would write, or alternatively for a story that someone else would write. As expected, drawing an alien for someone else produced a more creative alien. In Studies 2a and 2b, construal level (i.e., psychological distance) was independently manipulated. Participants generated more creative ideas on behalf of distant others than on behalf of either close others or themselves. Finally, in Study 3, a classic insight problem was investigated. Participants deciding for others were more likely to solve the problem; furthermore, this result was mediated by psychological distance. These findings demonstrate that people are more creative for others than for themselves and shed light on differences in self--other decision making.

T1  - When and why does extended contact work? The role of high quality direct contact and group norms in the development of positive ethnic intergroup attitudes amongst children
AN  - 902083847; 201122117
AB  - This research examines quasi-experimentally for the first time whether direct contact moderates the extended contact effect amongst children, and whether the extended contact effect is mediated by either in-group or out-group norms about cross-ethnic friendships. We tested two forms of extended contact (Dual identity and Common in-group identity) among ethnic majority children aged 6-11 years (white-English, n = 153) with differing levels of high quality (i.e., cross-ethnic friendships) or low quality (i.e., acquaintances) direct contact with the Indian-English out-group. As expected, the extended contact effect was demonstrated only amongst children who reported less high quality direct contact. Furthermore, we found the effect of extended contact was mediated by out-group norms. We also found evidence of moderated mediation, with the indirect effect of extended contact through in-group norms being significantly stronger amongst older children. The implications for extended contact theory and the future development of prejudice-reduction interventions amongst children are discussed.

T1  - Too Close for Comfort: Exploring Gender Differences in Inmate Attitudes Toward Homosexuality in Prison
AN  - 852897769; 201105249
AB  - Since the inception of the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2003, there has been increased interest in not only sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, but all aspects of prison sexuality. Correctional policies have focused on the homosexual population in attempts to protect these individuals from victimization and in attempts to decrease sexual relationships between inmates. While recent research has focused on the prevalence of homosexual behavior and the prevalence of sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, there has been little research on inmate attitudes toward homosexuality and same-sex sexual encounters in prison. The present study adds to the literature base by examining gender differences in attitudes toward inmate homosexuality among a sample of male and female inmates in a large Southern prison system. Findings revealed that male inmates, older inmates, and heterosexual inmates had significantly more negative attitudes toward homosexual inmates. Implications based on these findings are discussed.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 1928170803
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

T1  - Motherhood journey through the eyes of immigrant women
AN  - 1037877248; 201234556
AB  - This paper explores mothering practices and experiences among Southeast Asian women residing in Taiwan. This qualitative study used a series of focus group sessions with photographic documentation to collect information. The transition to motherhood illustrates a dynamics process of gender and international relations and hierarchies. Maternal practices and challenges of these immigrant women were organized into five domains: "A mother is prized because of her son", "I am a mother, not a paid nanny", "Raising children, Taiwanese style", "Shared mothering", and "Immigrant mothering -- More challenges, more promises". The experiences and adaptation of mothering are mediated by a family's socio-economic situation, the power dynamic within the family, and the support and acceptance received from the dominant society. These findings have important implications for healthcare services and immigration policies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Mental Health Stigma, Self-Concealment, and Help-Seeking Attitudes among Asian American and European American College Students with No Help-Seeking Experience
AN  - 1081866077; 201237403
AB  - The present study examined whether mental health stigma (i.e., negative attitudes toward people with a psychological disorder) and self-concealment are unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes in Asian American and European American college students with no history of seeking professional psychological services. The Asian American group had less favorable help-seeking attitudes overall, lower levels of stigma tolerance and interpersonal openness, greater mental health stigma, and greater self-concealment than the European American group. Mental health stigma and self-concealment were unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes overall in both groups. However, mental health stigma was not a unique predictor of recognition of need for psychotherapeutic help and confidence in mental health practitioners, the components of help-seeking attitudes theorized to be most associated with actual help-seeking behavior. Self-concealment was a unique predictor of confidence in mental health practitioners in the Asian American group, but not in the European American group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Anti-Muslim Attitudes in The Netherlands: Tests of Contradictory Hypotheses Derived from Ethnic Competition Theory and Intergroup Contact Theory
AN  - 1018358094; 201212882
AB  - In this study, we set out to explain anti-Muslim attitudes in the Netherlands. Although the presence and immigration of Muslims have become widely discussed, there is little systematic evidence about the determinants underlying anti-Muslim attitudes. Using data from the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands (SOCON) survey (2005, 2006), containing a more detailed measurement of anti-Muslim attitudes, we tested two contradictory mechanisms, derived from ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory. Results from hierarchical structural equation modelling indicate that the relative outgroup size induces both intergroup friendship contact as well as perceptions of ethnic threat. However, only the latter turned out to affect anti-Muslim attitudes directly. Moreover, our findings revealed that contact with colleagues belonging to ethnic minority groups reduces negative attitudes towards Muslims and mediates the effect of individual-level determinants on anti-Muslim attitudes. The complementary nature of both ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory is illustrated by negative correlation between both mediating mechanisms, as well as the support for a curvilinear relationship between outgroup size and perceived ethnic threat.

T1  - Attitudes influence implicit racial face categorization in a perceptual task
AN  - 1018356374; 201212746
AB  - Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

AB  - A sample of 168 African American undergraduates was surveyed to clarify past findings demonstrating a consistent relationship between endorsing negative attitudes about being African American and experiencing negative affect. Specifically, shame was tested as a mediator between participants' endorsement of preencounter attitudes (i.e., anti-Black attitudes) and both feelings of depression and global self-esteem, respectively. As predicted, shame acted as a complete mediator in both equations. Limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Multilevel Mediation Model of Stress and Coping for Women with HIV and Their Families
AN  - 816473157; 21083552
AB  - Families are influential systems and may be an important context in which to consider the stress and coping process. To date, many studies have focused on modeling the stress and coping process for the individual, isolated from the family. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to investigate a cross-sectional stress and coping model for HIV-positive African-American mothers recruited from HIV service facilities in South Florida (n=214) and their family members (n=294). Avoidance coping was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between stress and psychological distress. In addition, the family average of individual stress was hypothesized to moderate the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress. For all constructs, individuals reported on themselves and multilevel modeling techniques were used to account for similarities between members of the same family. The estimated mediation effect was significant. Aggregated family stress significantly moderated the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress. This study suggests that individuals exhibit different relationships between avoidance coping and psychological outcomes and that average stress reported by members of a family moderates the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress.

T1  - Queering Mariel: Mediating Cold War Foreign Policy and U.S. Citizenship among Cuba's Homosexual Exile Community, 1978-1994
AN  - 734812069
AB  - One might imagine that the gay and lesbian Marielitos, or Cubans who entered the United States from Cuba's Mariel harbor, would aim to conceal their homosexuality to better their chances of being admitted into the United States. Homosexuality may have officially been grounds to exclude one from entering the US, and consequently from achieving American citizenship, but most homosexual Marielitos had a different experience. In fact, the evidence suggests the US did not deport a single Marielito solely based on his or her homosexuality. Here, Capo utilizes a number of sources--including articles from the national, local, and gay press; government documents; and autobiographical accounts--to explore how anti-Communism and the persecution of homosexuals in late Cold War America played out simultaneously and altered immigration policies in Cuba and the United States. The evidence suggests that the United States drastically shifted its long-standing antihomosexual stance on immigration and citizenship to reconcile its position as a refuge for those fleeing Cuban Communism.

T1  - An Expectancy/Value Perspective on the Demotivating Effects of Prejudice
AN  - 1866473495
AB  - This study examined whether expecting prejudice is demotivating. Women were led to believe they were being evaluated for a co-manager position. They were randomly assigned to receive information that the evaluator held negative attitudes toward women or that he did not. We hypothesized that compared to women led to believe that the evaluator was unprejudiced, women led to believe the evaluator was prejudiced would: (a) have lower expectations for being chosen as co-manager; (b) place less value on being chosen as co-manager; and (c) be less motivated to perform a task that would influence selection as co-manager. We predicted that the effect of prejudice on motivation would be mediated by expectations and valuing of success. Results were consistent with predictions.

T1  - Stacked Deck: An Effective, School-Based Program for the Prevention of Problem Gambling
AN  - 902082256; 201123890
AB  - School-based prevention programs are an important component of problem gambling prevention, but empirically effective programs are lacking. Stacked Deck is a set of 5-6 interactive lessons that teach about the history of gambling; the true odds and "house edge"; gambling fallacies; signs, risk factors, and causes of problem gambling; and skills for good decision making and problem solving. An overriding theme of the program is to approach life as a "smart gambler" by determining the odds and weighing the pros versus cons of your actions. A total of 949 grade 9-12 students in 10 schools throughout southern Alberta received the program and completed baseline and follow-up measures. These students were compared to 291 students in 4 control schools. Four months after receiving the program, students in the intervention group had significantly more negative attitudes toward gambling, improved knowledge about gambling and problem gambling, improved resistance to gambling fallacies, improved decision making and problem solving, decreased gambling frequency, and decreased rates of problem gambling. There was no change in involvement in high risk activities or money lost gambling. These results indicate that Stacked Deck is a promising curriculum for the prevention of problem gambling.

T1  - Willing to Work: Agency and Vulnerability in an Undocumented Immigrant Network
AN  - 848560986
AB  - Restriction-oriented immigration policies and polarizing political debates have intensified the vulnerability of undocumented people in the United States, promoting their "willingness" to do low-wage, low-status work. In this article, I draw on ethnographic research with undocumented immigrants in Chicago to examine the everyday strategies that undocumented workers develop to mediate constraints and enhance their well-being. In particular, I explore how a cohort of undocumented Mexican immigrants cultivates a social identity as "hard workers" to promote their labor and bolster dignity and self-esteem. Much of the existing literature on unauthorized labor migration has focused on the structural conditions that encumber immigrants and constrain their opportunities. By shifting the focus to workers' agency, I seek to complement these analyses and show how undocumented immigrants actively navigate the terrain of work and society in the United States.

T1  - A Million Dollar Exit from the Anarchic Slum-world: Slumdog Millionaire's hollow idioms of social justice
AN  - 754037723; 201050336
AB  - This article contests the characterisation of the popular and acclaimed film, Slumdog Millionaire, as a realistic portrayal of India's urban poverty that will ultimately serve as a tool of advocacy for India's urban poor. It argues that the film's reductive view of slum-spaces will more probably reinforce negative attitudes towards slum-dwellers, lending credibility to the sorts of policies that have historically dispossessed them of power and dignity. By drawing attention to the film's celebration of characters and spaces that symbolise Western culture and Northern trajectories of 'development', the article also critically engages with some of the issues raised by the film's enormous success.
