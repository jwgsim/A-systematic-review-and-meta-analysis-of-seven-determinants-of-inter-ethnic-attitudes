T1  - Does personality “Trump” ideology? narcissism predicts support for Trump via ideological tendencies
AN  - 2653931474
AB  - Former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory defied expectations. Trump was an unconventional candidate, and his presidency was true to form. What accounts for his popularity? Integrating work on narcissism with the dual-process motivational model of ideology, we propose that individuals higher in narcissism are more likely to adopt right-wing authoritarian and social-dominance oriented attitudes, which lead them to embrace socially and economically conservative policy positions, respectively. Thus, they are receptive to Trump’s anti-immigration stance, a centerpiece of his political messaging from the campaign trail to the White House. The present study (N = 302) yielded results consistent with this analysis: Right-wing authoritarianism and social-dominance orientation mediated the association between narcissism and Trump support, via social and economic conservatism and immigration attitudes. The study represents an initial test of a potentially generative framework on which future research can elaborate.

T1  - Disrupting times in the wake of the pandemic: Dispositional time attitudes, time perception and temporal focus
AN  - 2649931756
AB  - Introduction  The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of people’s lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. People’s positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional pre–COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus.  Methods  One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported.  Results  Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus.  Discussion  Dispositional time attitudes would impact students’ capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Transnational relationships and virtual technology: an ethnographic study of the left-behind wives in Kerala
AN  - 2573430145
AB  - Modern technology plays a complicated role in (re)shaping the transnational relationships between migrated men and their left-behind wives in Kerala. Since the 1990s, the Malabar region in Kerala has witnessed large-scale migration of its workforce to the Gulf countries. As these women juggle between family, migration, and gaps in socio-economic development, multiple forms of technologies and surveillance complicate the institutionalization of patriarchy within the private sphere in the name of women’s safety. Technological devices turn the migrants’ wives into docile bodies, observable at any moment by their husbands’ virtual eyes. This paper argues that using modern technology, which is operated around the idea of surveillance, migrant husbands foster a “mediated patriarchy.” Further, modern technology (re)shapes transnational relationships and functions as a double-edged weapon in the left-behind wives’ lives. Qualitative approaches and ethnography have been used to understand the demographic profile and personal experiences of the left-behind wives in Kerala.

T1  - Emotional Reactions and Coping of Mexican Mixed‐Status Immigrant Families in Anticipation of the 2016 Presidential Election
AN  - 2535619343
AB  - The present study illuminates the emotions of mixed‐status families as they anticipated the 2016 Presidential election. From a 6‐year longitudinal case study of four Mexican immigrant families, we present interviews from May of 2016, prior to the presidential primaries, and from November of 2016, the day before or the day of the presidential election. Using a multiple case study method (Stake, 2006, Multiple case study analysis. Guilford Press, New York; Yin, 2014, Case study research: Design and methods (5th ed.). Sage, Los Angeles, CA), our primary goal was to describe how immigrant Mexican adults and their preadolescent and adolescent children (or grandchildren) personally and collectively reacted emotionally to the events leading up to the 2016 presidential election, and how they managed and coped with their emotions. Our secondary goal was to explain how their emotional reactions changed over time and were influenced by age and immigration status. Initially, participants expressed concern and fear about the anti‐immigration rhetoric by the conservative political movement, but largely felt reassured that such rhetoric would not prevail. In the days immediately preceding the election, a notable change seemed apparent among all participants, regardless of immigration status. They expressed having intense emotions ranging from fear and angst to disbelief, anger, and denial, which they attempted to manage through external (e.g., community involvement, activism, solidarity) and internal (e.g., family communication, cognitive strategies) actions. Older adolescents had a better understanding of the implications of the election for their family than younger adolescents did. We provide recommendations for family practice and policy aimed to support and advocate on behalf of immigrant families.Alternate abstract:➨ResumenEl presente estudio explica las emociones de las familias cuyos miembros tienen distinta situación migratoria mientras esperaban la elección presidencial de 2016. De un caso práctico longitudinal de seis años de cuatro familias de inmigrantes mexicanos, presentamos entrevistas de mayo de 2016, antes de las primarias presidenciales, y de noviembre de 2016, el día antes o el día de la elección presidencial. Utilizando un método de casos prácticos múltiples (Stake, 2006; Yin, 2014), nuestro objetivo principal fue describir cómo los adultos inmigrantes mexicanos y sus hijos preadolescentes y adolescentes (o nietos) reaccionaron personal y colectivamente a los acontecimientos previos a la elección presidencial de 2016, y cómo manejaron y afrontaron sus emociones. Nuestro objetivo secundario fue explicar cómo sus reacciones emocionales cambiaron con el tiempo y estuvieron influenciadas por la edad y la situación inmigratoria. Inicialmente, los participantes expresaron preocupación y miedo acerca de la retórica contra los inmigrantes por parte del movimiento político conservador, pero en su gran mayoría estaban convencidos de que dicha retórica no prevalecería. Los días inmediatamente anteriores a la elección, se hizo evidente un cambio notable entre todos los participantes, independientemente de la situación de inmigración. Ellos dijeron tener emociones intensas, desde miedo y angustia hasta incredulidad, ira y rechazo, que intentaron manejar mediante medidas externas (p. ej.: participación en la comunidad, activismo, solidaridad) e internas (p. ej.: comunicación familiar, estrategias cognitivas). Los adolescentes mayores tuvieron una mejor comprensión de las implicancias de la elección para su familia que los adolescentes más jóvenes. Ofrecemos recomendaciones para la práctica familiar orientadas a apoyar y a abogar por las familias inmigrantes.Alternate abstract:➨摘要本研究阐明了不同地位的家庭成员在期待2016年总统大选结果时的情绪表现。本研究针对四个墨西哥移民家庭展开了为期6年的长期性案例研究，文中报告了2016年5月总统初选之前所做的访谈，以及2016年11月大选前一天或大选当天的采访。本研究的主要目的是描述墨西哥移民家庭的成年人和青春期前、青春期（或者孙辈）的孩子们，他们作为个人和整个家庭面对所有导致2016总统大选前的事件如何做出情感反应的，以及他们如何管理和应对这些情绪的。研究方法使用的是多案例研究方法 (Stake, 2006; Yin, 2014), 我们的第二个目的是解释随着时间的变化，情感反应如何发生变化，如何受年龄和移民身份状态的影响。起初，参与者会对保守派政治运动的反移民言论表达担忧和恐惧，可是他们很放心，这种言论不会盛行。在大选前的几天里，无论移民身份如何，所有参与者都表达了他们的情感在这个期间的明显变化。他们表达了强烈的情绪，从恐惧和焦虑到怀疑，他们也试图通过外部的（如社区参与、行动主义、团结）和内部（家庭沟通、认知策略行动）来控制这些情绪。年纪较大的青少年比年龄较小的青少年更能理解选举对他们家庭的意义。我们代表移民家庭，为旨在支持和倡导移民家庭的家庭实践活动和政策提供建议。

T1  - The coughing body: etiquettes, techniques, sonographies and spaces
AN  - 2533060988
AB  - With newfound relevance in the context of Covid-19, we focus on the coughing body, building on an in-depth qualitative study of three UK lung infection clinics treating people with cystic fibrosis. Conceptually we take our cue from Norbert Elias and the way something as physiologically fundamental as coughing becomes the focus of etiquette and technique, touching also on themes central to Mary Douglas’ anthropology of pollution. This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices. Third, coughing is seen to be central to the sonographic soundscape of the healthcare environment whereby people learn to recognise (and sometimes misrecognise) each other through the ‘sound’ of the cough. Finally, coughing properly can be seen to have both a ‘time and a place’ including the retreat of the cough from public space into risky confined spaces. Our conclusion speculates on the way these insights shed light on aspects of life that, until the Covid-19 pandemic, lay largely hidden.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parents: Examining the Antecedents of Parenting Ability Evaluation
AN  - 2514989020
AB  - Hostility toward same-sex parenting is widespread. Literature supports one persistent argument against same-sex parenting which focusses on the concern for children’s wellbeing, whereas lesbian and gay parents’ ability is sometimes evaluated positively. In particular, the belief that children need both a father and a mother impacts the evaluation that same-sex parents are unfit to raise well-adjusted children. The present research aimed to investigate linking mechanisms and conditional processes underlying the evaluation of same-sex parents’ ability. Cisgender heterosexual Italian participants (N = 320) read one of four vignettes describing a family situation – two types of same-sex (step)parents (i.e., lesbian and gay (step)parents) vs. two types of different-sex (step)parents (i.e., heterosexual (step)parents) – in which a child misbehaved in the context of a mild family disagreement. After reading the vignette, the participants rated parenting ability and to what extent the child’s misbehavior was attributable to the parenting relationship. Moderated-mediation analyses indicated that same-sex (step)parents were perceived as being less capable parents compared to different-sex (step)parents by giving them greater responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, among participants with medium and high levels of gender role beliefs. Implications for research on sexual discrimination are discussed.

T1  - Cross-border reproductive care: Opinions and attitudes of society towards surrogate pregnancy
AN  - 2494827275
AB  - Surrogate pregnancy (SP) has acquired a prominent public profile through the bioethical, legal and media debates this cross-border reproductive practice has raised worldwide. The different social agents involved in the phenomenon frequently appeal to public opinion looking for legitimation and endorsement of their ethical and political positions on the matter. However, opinion polls occupy a marginal place in research about SP. The article presents the findings of the scoping review of 31 scientific articles (1985–2017) analysing public opinion regarding SP in 13 countries. The aim is to single out the main subtopics covered by the studies in order to identify research gaps as well as describe and analyse SP as a socio-cultural construct and ‘social problem’ which is currently situated in a complex multidimensional arena made of conflicting narratives and attitudes that divide international public opinion along each one of the identified subtopics. Additionally, the article presents the results of the survey Opinion and Attitudes of the Spanish Population towards Adoption, Fostering and Gestational Surrogacy (2018), the first conducted in Spain with a representative national sample.

T1  - What is the image of refugees in Central European media?
AN  - 2493941351
AB  - Of late, the national and the international politics of Central Europe have been preoccupied with the issue of migration, an issue labelled ‘the refugee crisis’ by the media. This article examines whether the strong anti-immigrant rhetoric which has become common in the countries of the Visegrad Group (CZ, SK, PL, HU) can also be found in the photographs of refugees produced and circulated by their most popular online media. The systematically designed mixed-method visual analysis, which is applied to pictures from a 1-year period between April 2015 and April 2016, reveals a set of repeatedly displayed visual figures such as a young female victim, children imprisoned behind a fence or a silent mass of bodies. The research shows that these figures are not only common to all the Visegrad countries, but they also significantly correspond to the transnational image of refugees. The text deconstructs a three-part story of the ‘refugee crisis’ and how it was told by Central European online media. It emphasises the stereotypical gender construction of the figures of refugees, links the visual analysis to several theories of the photography of suffering and, finally, provides a description of how a collective symbolic imagination of refugees operates through media in the Central European region.

T1  - Television in Convergent Media Environment: Audience Trends
AN  - 2558153531
AB  - The article focusses on the last decade TV consumption trends in Russia. The concept of media convergence forms theoretical basis of the research. Due to convergence, the configuration of screen consumption, including television and online video, changes. The research provides evidence that in the first half of the last decade there was an increase in the average television viewing time. After 2016, a gradual decline in the audience's attention to television took place. During the latest crisis associated with the pandemic, the trend of a decrease in the Russian television audience reversed. Media convergence processes brings for broadcast television further increase of competition with streaming services, video exchange services, online movie theatres. Based on representative sample of Russian population, the results show that nearly third of the audience believes that television plays an important role in their life and leisure. It is recorded that negative attitude to television is primarily predicted by variables of dissatisfaction with the choice and content of programs; belonging to a group of young people aged 15–24 years; dissatisfaction with the implementation of the information function by Russian television. The author argues that the domination of the commercial imperative and mass formats of postmodern culture forms a moral and emotional content of a significant part of television programs. Often, this does not correspond to the interests of a sufficiently wide audience. Under current conditions, television does not perform a number of social functions important for Russian society

T1  - Immigration, presidential politics, and partisan polarization among the American public, 1992–2018
AN  - 2539413726
AB  - We extend theories about “immigration backlash” and right-wing populism in three ways by analyzing trend data to examine the interplay between views of immigration, partisan polarization, and voting patterns in presidential elections. First, we document how immigration views became more aligned with partisan polarization between 2000 and 2018. Second, we show that immigration views were significantly more predictive of voting for Donald Trump in 2016 compared to Republican presidential candidates in the 1992 through 2012 elections. Due to increased partisan polarization, the indirect effects of immigration views on presidential voting (as mediated through political ideology and party identification) also increased over time, and were stronger in 2016 compared to previous elections. Finally, we show evidence of a post-Trump backlash on immigration views, with political independents and Democrats becoming significantly more favorable toward immigration after 2016. By 2018, the American public was more polarized over matters of immigration than at any time previous in the available data, and these views corresponded more strongly with voting patterns. These findings highlight the increasing importance of immigration for understanding partisan politics in the contemporary U.S., and reiterate the importance of anti-immigrant sentiment and partisan polarization to the success of right-wing populism in electoral democracies.

T1  - Exploring Inconsistencies in the Interpretation of Canada’s Section 161 Order for Sexual Offending
AN  - 2521461068
AB  - Community-based risk management strategies for people convicted of sexual offences (PCSO) can hinder successful reintegration, which plays an important role in reducing sexual recidivism. Section 161 of the Criminal Code is a Canadian risk management strategy, which aims to protect children by prohibiting people convicted of sexual offences against children (PCSO-C) from engaging in behaviours assumed (sometimes erroneously) to be associated with sexual offending. This study was the first to evaluate Section 161 prohibition orders. We explored inconsistencies in the interpretation and (hypothetical) application of these conditions between PCSO-C subject to Section 161 and two non-forensic subsamples of the Canadian public – community members and undergraduate students. Non-forensic participants expressed more negative attitudes towards the treatment of PCSO, which were found to mediate the relationship between group membership and subjective legal decision-making. Degree of support for Section 161 conditions did not appear to moderate this effect. Results raise concerns about the potential for increased personal discretion when enforcing or adhering to ambiguous or overly broad legal conditions. We suggest the need for continued efforts to establish an empirical understanding of the application, efficacy, and potential collateral consequences associated with this Canadian risk management strategy.Alternate abstract:
Les stratégies de gestion du risque dans la communauté pour les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles (PCIS) peuvent nuire à une réintégration réussie, ce qui joue un rôle important dans la réduction de récidive sexuelle. L’article 161 du Code criminel est une stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne, laquelle cherche à protéger les enfants en empêchant les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles contre les enfants (PCIS-E) d’avoir des comportements qui sont présumés (parfois de façon erronée) comme étant associés avec des infractions sexuelles. Cette étude a été la première à évaluer l’ordonnance d’interdiction de l’article 161 et à explorer les incohérences dans l’interprétation et l’exécution de ces conditions entre les PCIS-E contraints par l’article 161 et deux sous-échantillons non judiciaires du public canadien – des membres de la communauté et des étudiants de premier cycle. Les participants non judiciaires ont exprimé des attitudes plus négatives envers le traitement des PCIS, ce qui servait de médiateur entre l’appartenance au groupe et la prise de décision juridique subjective. Un certain soutien des conditions de l’article 161 conditions n’a pas semblé modérer cet effet. Les résultats soulèvent des inquiétudes en ce qui concerne le potentiel d’avoir une plus grande discrétion personnelle lors de la mise en application de conditions légales ambiguës et trop étendues. Nous suggérons que nous devons continuer nos efforts pour établir une compréhension empirique de la mise en application, de l’efficacité et des conséquences collatérales potentielles associées avec cette stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne.

T1  - ‘calling‐out’ vs. ‘calling‐in’ prejudice: Confrontation style affects inferred motive and expected outcomes
AN  - 2474519753
AB  - Laypersons differentiate between two confrontations styles, varying in communication style, perceived motive, and typical context: call‐outs (typically public, non‐accommodating language, and self‐promoting confronter) and call‐ins (typically private, accommodating language, and education‐focused confronter). Popular press espouses a general preference for call‐ins relative to call‐outs, but no empirical work has addressed perceptions of these confrontation styles. To investigate the presumed efficacy of these styles, we modelled communicative differences with Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT), which explores the strategies individuals use to modulate communicative differences with interaction partners. The present studies examined third‐party perceptions of confronter motive and likely outcomes between call‐in and call‐out styles (Study 1) and between typical private and atypical public styles (Study 2) about an anti‐Black comment. We examined responses of participants who imagined themselves taking part in public vs. private call‐in and call‐out confrontations (Study 3). Results showed that these styles are seen as similarly effective in terms of target compliance and internalization, but as operating through different mechanisms. Specifically, call‐in styles facilitated positive inferences of motive, which fostered expectations of positive confrontation outcomes. Additionally, the effects of communication style superseded the impact of context. Results have implications for strategies allies can use to facilitate effective, educational confrontations of prejudice.

AB  - Intercultural communication acts a pivotal part in international activities and there are many barriers involved in it. If the communicators are short of the understanding of the barriers in the process of intercultural communication, especially the affective barriers, the whole interaction will be affected; even worse, there will be some serious conflicts. Thus, this paper will study the affective barriers in intercultural communication, analyze the possible causes of the barriers, and put forward some effective strategies to help communicators enhance their cross-cultural competence.

T1  - Perceptions of Not Equally Tolerable Discriminations: Is Personal Experience so Decisive?
AN  - 2472327776
AB  - Discrimination is nowadays more frequently perceived, whilst not always readily identifiable. This study extends previous research on perceived discrimination by examining, simultaneously, the effects of both direct and indirect personal experiences of discrimination, together with sociodemographic variables (conservatism and social status), on the perception of group‐based discriminations; in addition to the mediating role of discriminatory outgroup attitudes. All of this comparing discriminations that are not understood as equally tolerable (race–nationality vs. age–disability discriminations), in two different nationwide surveys (2013 and 2016), and applying multigroup structural equation modelling. The final models showed different patterns, depending on the type of perceived discrimination. Whilst the effects of experiences were similar in both models, those as a result of sociodemographic variables differed, coupled with the interrelation between outgroup attitudes and perceived group‐based discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes showed to be what most affected both types of perceived discrimination, although in opposite directions.

T1  - Seeing the human in everyone: Multicultural experiences predict more positive intergroup attitudes and humanitarian helping through identification with all humanity
AN  - 2499392584
AB  - Prior research suggests two components of multicultural experiences-contact with cultural members and experiences with cultural elements-predict less prejudice via stronger identification with all humanity (IWAH). However, only one factor of IWAH (bond) was tested, and only United States samples were used. The present research examined both factors of IWAH (bond with, and concern for, all humanity) and used a nationally representative sample from Poland (N = 974), a more ethnically homogeneous and collectivist culture. We explored the association between multicultural experiences and negative intergroup attitudes (measured via fear of refugees, Islamophobia, and ethnocentrism) and humanitarian helping, and also tested the mediating role of both factors of IWAH on these attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. Results largely replicate and extend prior findings, revealing contact with cultural members directly predicted stronger bond with and concern for all humanity, and less negative intergroup attitudes toward "others" (but not humanitarian helping). In contrast, experiences with cultural elements directly predicted stronger concern for all humanity (but not bond) and greater humanitarian helping (but not intergroup attitudes). Bond with all humanity mediated the association between contact with cultural members and less negative intergroup attitudes, while concern for all humanity mediated the association between both components of multicultural experiences and greater humanitarian helping. Findings support the benefits of multicultural experiences and their association with stronger IWAH and more positive intergroup outcomes beyond the United States, and also indicate unique roles for the IWAH bond and concern factors. Cultural differences, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Is Fascism the Main Danger Today? Trump and Techno-Neoliberalism
AN  - 2455574211
AB  - In his analysis of political language during the Trump era, Kelly argues that Donald Trump, far from being the fascist that his left-liberal opponents make him out to be, has overseen a continued weakening of state power in the face of a rising neoliberal techno-capitalism. Looked at closely, Trump's policies, such as the enforcement and tightening of immigration laws, have not actually deviated significantly from those of prior administrations, even if the anti-immigrant rhetoric has been ramped up. The more serious threats to liberal principles such as freedom of expression have come from the social media companies that have colluded to banish right-wing populist messages from the internet. He concludes that Trump's opponents are fighting the battles against fascism, racism, and sexism of a bygone era when today's true dangers lie with the neoliberal shift of power away from the state and toward the corporations that now increasingly control both state policy and the public sphere itself.

T1  - Superficial ingroup love? Collective narcissism predicts ingroup image defense, outgroup prejudice, and lower ingroup loyalty
AN  - 2448123183
AB  - We examined the associations between the need for personal control, different types of ingroup commitment, and group‐related outcomes: (1) defensive responses to ingroup criticism, (2) ingroup disloyalty, and (3) outgroup attitudes. We assumed that collective narcissism (i.e., a belief in ingroup’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and stems from frustrated individual needs) should be concerned with defending the ingroup image and derogating outgroups, but not necessarily with being loyal to the ingroup. Secure ingroup identification (i.e., a confidently held ingroup evaluation, which stems from satisfied needs), in contrast, should predict greater ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. We expected these effects to be especially strong once we account for the overlap between collective narcissism and group‐level self‐investment – a key component of ingroup identification. In a nationally representative sample of Polish adults (n = 1,007), collective narcissism (net of group‐level self‐investment) mediated between low personal control and ingroup image defense, lower group loyalty, and less positive outgroup attitudes. Secure ingroup identification (group‐level self‐investment net of collective narcissism) mediated between high personal control and ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. It was not associated with ingroup image defense. Implications for understanding the role of identification in inter‐ and intra‐group relations are discussed.

T1  - Discursive shifts and the normalisation of racism: imaginaries of immigration, moral panics and the discourse of contemporary right-wing populism
AN  - 2435504490
AB  - Looking at mediated, political and wider public discourses on immigration in Poland since 2015 and exploring these in the context of the country’s right-wing populist politics, the paper develops a multi-step normalisation model which allows analysing how radical or often blatantly racist discourse can not only be strategically introduced into the public domain but also evolve into an acceptable and legitimate perspective in perceptions of immigrants and refugees. The paper highlights the strategic as well as opportunistic introduction of anti-immigration rhetoric in/by the political mainstream in Poland in recent years, often on the back of the so-called post-2014 European “Refugee Crisis”. It explores normalisation as part and parcel of a wider multistep process of strategically orchestrated discursive shifts wherein discourses characterised by extreme positions have been enacted, gradated/perpetuated and eventually normalised as an integral part of pronounced right-wing populist agenda. The paperfurthers a view that normalisation entails the creation and sustainment of a peculiar borderline discourse wherein unmitigated radical statements are often married with seemingly civil and apparently politically correct language and argumentation. The latter are used to pre-/legitimise uncivil or even outright radical positions and ideologies by rationalising them and making them into acceptable elements of public discourse.

T1  - Filial discrepancy and mortality among community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study
AN  - 2430093089
AB  - Objectives: Adult children play a significant role in ageing parents’ health and well-being. However, the evidence is mixed regarding whether the parent-child relations will affect older adults’ longevity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between filial discrepancy and mortality risk.Method: Data were derived from a prospective cohort study from 2011 to 2017 of US Chinese older adults aged 60 and above in the Greater Chicago area, with a median of follow-up of 5.28 years. Filial discrepancy was assessed by the gap between filial expectation and receipt, including six domains (discrepancy in respect, greet, care, obey, make happy, and financial support). Mortality ascertained during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used.Results: Among 3,021 participants, care expectation was least fulfilled while financial expectation was better fulfilled compared with other filial discrepancy domains. Compared with no respect discrepancy, older adults with respect expectation above receipt had higher risk of mortality (HR, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.07–1.94). Older adults with higher greet expectation than receipt experienced greater risk of mortality (HR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.16–2.09) than those with no greet discrepancy. Older adults with care receipt above expectation had lower risk of mortality (HR, 0.75; 95%CI, 0.56–1.00).Conclusion: This study extends the relative standards model to investigate mortality outcomes. The findings add new insights to the association between parent-child relations and mortality risk. It is suggested that educational programs could focus on fostering young immigrants’ attitude and behavior to provide more respect and greeting for aging parents to strengthen the family protection role.

T1  - Nada sobre nosotros sin nosotros: Reflections on the TPS movement and its fight for permanent residency
AN  - 2358999597
AB  - After the election of Donald Trump, the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) community faced an uncertain future that pushed many to mobilize politically. As a Salvadoreña, I have paid special attention to how these changes affect Salvadoran communities in the United States. Since 2001, more than 200,000 Salvadorans had lived in the United States legally under the TPS program. As the name suggests, the program was supposed to provide temporary relief for Salvadorans fleeing devastating earthquakes that rocked El Salvador. As other national disasters, prolonged droughts, and gang-related insecurity continued to plague El Salvador, US presidents renewed TPS for eighteen-month increments. When Trump became president, the fate of all communities with TPS was under attack as Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric spread throughout the country. At that historical moment, TPS holders and their allies organized their community to take political action. Launched in 2017, the National TPS Alliance comprises more than forty local communities and organizations, including the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) and the Central American Resource Center in Los Angeles (CARECEN-LA). The alliance has emerged as a diverse group of communities rallying to reshape the TPS program and challenge their liminal legality. Inspired by popular education values of solidarity and collective work, members of the National TPS Alliance have organized, lobbied, and marched to demand that the US government pass legislation that would provide a path to permanent residency. Individuals from the thirteen countries that once held TPS status have used various tools, including storytelling, to garner support from their own communities and their allies. At the same time, allies have held social media campaigns to urge their representatives to publicly support TPS extension. For example, #BakeforBaker encouraged residents of Massachusetts to bake a cake for Charlie Baker, the Republican governor, to support the TPS cause. By encouraging TPS and non-TPS holders, citizens and noncitizens, adults and children, the alliance has created a new movement of solidarity and action grounded in the community’s social consciousness.

T1  - Female Video Game Players and the Protective Effect of Feminist Identity Against Internalized Misogyny
AN  - 2234287504
AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one’s own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women’s gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

T1  - Chapter 7: "I had to get tougher": An African Immigrant's (Counter)narrative of Language, Race, and Resistance
AN  - 2507952304
AB  - Background/Context: With the incessant wave of anti-Black and anti-immigrant sentiments, the extant political situation in the contemporary United States presents an ideal space, place, and time to investigate Black immigrant students' experiences and examine the ways in which dominant racial and linguistic ideologies shape their literate identities and position them in schools and society. While the Black immigrant population overall continues to increase, the Black immigrant student population in United States K–12 schools has experienced a steady upward trend. This student population shares some of the racialized experiences of Black American students but also reflects distinctive cultural, linguistic, and literate identities, and experiences that we, as educators, must acknowledge and embrace if we are to help them effectively navigate the educational and social terrain of the U.S. Purpose/Research Questions: The purpose of this article is to amplify (counter)narratives that highlight one adolescent African immigrant's (Noemi) identities and languages within and beyond school spaces, to exemplify the ways in which she utilizes alternative literacies to accommodate, and/or resist racial and immigration status-based microaggressions. The study was guided by the following questions: 1) What are Noemi's literacy, language, and identity practices in and beyond school spaces? 2) What are the ways in which she utilizes these practices to resist stereotypes and other forms of marginalization? Research Design: Utilizing a narrative case study approach, the article highlights the lived experiences of a single participant - Noemi. Narrative case study allowed me to intentionally give life to Noemi's stories regarding her home and school experiences, the ways in which she has been positioned due to her unique identity, language, and literacy practices, and her methods of resistance. Data Collection and Analysis: Data sources included two semistructured interviews and a Venn diagram that consisted of a comparison of the focal participant's home and school literacies. A relational content analysis was conducted using the information provided in the Venn diagram, and interview data were transcribed and analyzed using the constant comparative method. Critical race theory, a raciolinguistic perspective, and resistance theory were considered in the analysis and framing of the resulting counternarratives. Findings/Results: Noemi's counternarratives were characterized by three emergent themes: (a) being raised African in America, (b) racial literacies, music, and social media, and (c) race, language, and the sociopolitical climate. Each of the themes and their corresponding subthemes were supported by elements of critical race theory and a raciolinguistic perspective. In addition, Noemi's counternarratives consisted of numerous "clapbacks" (effective responses to criticisms, stereotypes, and dominant ideologies) that served as indicators of resistance. Conclusions/Recommendations: Noemi's counternarratives suggest three acknowledgments to be made. First, educators must acknowledge identity practices beyond those seen in academic spaces and tap into the vast metaknowledge of their immigrant populations. Second, we must not lose sight that dominant, hegemonic messages with regard to languages, literacies, and cultures are not only produced by the dominant group, but that they are also (re)produced by the media and nonwhite people to marginalize and maintain structural hierarchies. Therefore, critical conversations are needed with native nonwhite groups to prevent discriminatory practices and maltreatment of immigrant students. Finally, if we are to create equitable and socially just academic environments, educators must acknowledge manifestations of resistance (in its many forms) and use this knowledge to help transform schooling environments in which immigrants, like Noemi, are expected to thrive. They must also identify the ways in which they function as part of institutional norms, to create situations that require students to leverage "clapbacks" in schools.

T1  - "With the Utmost Practical Speed": Eisenhower, Hungarian Parolees, and the "Hidden Hand" Behind US Immigration and Refugee Policy, 1956–1957
AN  - 2361951576
AB  - From December 1956 to May 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower made unprecedented use of the parole statute of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act in order to rapidly admit 38,000 Hungarian refugees to the United States. Characterizing this decision as a reactive effort to repair strained relationships with Western European allies following the Soviet invasion of Budapest, previous scholarship has correctly recognized that Eisenhower's actions "stretched American immigration law beyond belief"; at the same time, by assuming that sympathetic American legislators were eager to work with the president to find ways around legal obstacles to the admission of anti- Communist Hungarians, scholars to date have sidestepped the question of exactly how he managed to bypass congressional authority without provoking a constitutional crisis. Drawing upon sources including the president's personal papers, NSC memoranda, and State Department memos in order to more fully excavate the fraught process by which the president compelled Congress to cede control of immigration and refugee policy to the executive, this article argues that Eisenhower saw his use of the parole statute not only in reactive geo- political terms, but also as a proactive means of creating momentum for the reform of the nation's restrictive immigration policies. Asserting that the president sought deliberately to bypass legislators whose public expressions of sympathy obscured their lack of an affirmative commitment to the admission of Hungarian "freedom fighters," it further demonstrates that Eisenhower preemptively deployed a high- powered team of public relations professionals as part of a media-driven "end run" around restrictionist legislators whom he expected to oppose his use of the parole statute. Finally, highlighting the centrality of representations of Hungarian whiteness and Christianity to the executive- driven PR campaign that accompanied Eisenhower's refugee resettlement program, the article concludes that mid- century American notions of race and religion played a crucial role in generating public sympathy for displaced Hungarians and, by extension, in ensuring congressional acquiescence to Eisenhower's bold interventions into the jealously guarded sphere of refugee policy-making.

T1  - How to Enhance the Effects of Mediated Intergroup Contact? Evidence from Four Countries
AN  - 2334265612
AB  - We bridge the theorizing on mediated and imagined contact and integrate these two contact forms in one sequence within a single design. We experimentally examine whether (1) encouraging people to imagine a positive intergroup encounter prior to reading a personal story of an outgroup member as well as (2) mediated contact with an outgroup member similar or dissimilar to the ingroup prototype, improve outgroup attitudes. We also test the affective and cognitive mediators through which these effects emerge. Data from four different countries that test attitudes toward four distinct immigrant groups find that although imagined contact and similarity do not consistently improve outgroup attitudes, enhanced interest in the story of an outgroup member and positive emotions mediate the effects from similarity, and - in two countries - from imagined contact. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Values Predict Willingness to Interact With Immigrants: The Role of Cultural Ideology and Multicultural Acquisition
AN  - 2327883912
AB  - As globalization advances, immigration has increasingly been contested. Psychological studies of immigration, which are frequently conducted in Western contexts, have established a link between attitudes toward immigrants and individual values. In two studies, the present research investigates this link between values and favorability toward immigrants in an Asian nation with a high proportion of immigrants, Singapore, and considers differences in cultural ideologies and multicultural acquisition, based on the assumption that cultural ideologies and multicultural acquisition share broader underlying motivations with self-transcendence (growth and anxiety-free) and conservation values (protection and anxiety-avoidance). In Study 1, the cultural ideologies of multiculturalism and color blindness, as reified in the Singapore context, explained how self-transcendence and conservation values predict willingness to interact with immigrants. Greater support for multiculturalism mediated the positive relationship between self-transcendence values and favorability toward immigrants. Lower support for color blindness mediated the negative relationship between conservation values and favorability toward immigrants. In Study 2, experimentally induced self-transcendence and conservation values interacted with multicultural acquisition to affect willingness to interact with immigrants. Self-transcendence increased favorability toward immigrants for people with greater multicultural acquisition. Conservation decreased favorability toward immigrants for people with less multicultural acquisition. This research has implications for demonstrating that the cultural context matters for addressing how and among whom to improve intercultural contact in diverse, globalized societies.

T1  - Marry who you love: Intergroup contact with gay people and another stigmatized minority is related to voting on the restriction of gay rights through threat
AN  - 2312955855
AB  - The study examined factors associated with discrimination against gay people in a public referendum aimed at the restriction of gay rights. We tested whether positive and negative intergroup contact with gay people and intergroup contact with another stigmatized minority, the Roma, were associated with how the heterosexual majority voted in the referendum (i.e., discrimination). We tested two mechanisms underlying the link between intergroup contact and discrimination—the mediation by intergroup threat and the mediation by outgroup attitudes. We found that negative contact with both gay people and the Roma was associated with a higher probability of gay discrimination while positive contact was associated with a lower probability of gay discrimination. Intergroup threat, not intergroup attitudes, mediated the link between intergroup contact and discrimination. In the case of contact with gay people, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through threat from gay people. In the case of contact with Roma, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through the generalization of threats from the Roma to gay people but not via the generalization of outgroup attitudes. Our research brings novel evidence that contact with one minority can affect discrimination against another minority in both positive and negative way and that perceived threat, but not attitudes, plays a key role in majority's decision to discriminate against gay people.

T1  - Driven by Context? The Interrelated Effects of Parents, Peers, Classrooms on Development of Prejudice Among Swedish Majority Adolescents
AN  - 2309792151
AB  - Prejudice is one of the major threats to the cohesion of multicultural societies and adolescent years play a key role in its development. How social contexts contribute to adolescent prejudice is, however, not yet well-known. This 3-wave study of Swedish majority adolescents (N = 659; MageT1 = 13.41; MageT3 = 17.33) examined the effects of parents' and peers' attitudes on changes in youth attitudes toward immigrants as well as an interplay between parent, peer, and school context. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that within-person fluctuations in youth attitudes were positively related to fluctuations in peers' but not parents' attitudes. Both parents' and peers' attitudes, however, significantly predicted the differences in level and rate of change in attitudes between adolescents. In addition to these direct effects, mediation analysis showed that parents' attitudes predicted youth attitudes indirectly, via the attitudes of the peers youth associate with, suggesting an overall greater importance of parental bias. Peers' attitudes did not moderate the effects of parents but youth from ethnically diverse classrooms were less affected by their parents' prejudice than youth from less diverse classrooms. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of social context in the development of prejudice. They suggest that while parents set the stage, peers explain the day-to-day variation in prejudice, and that classroom diversity offsets some of the negative effects of parental bias.

T1  - Receptivity to dating and marriage across the religious divide in Northern Ireland: The role of intergroup contact
AN  - 2287776732
AB  - Intergroup contact has long been recognized as an important factor in promoting positive intergroup attitudes. However, in operationalizing intergroup attitudes, previous studies have rarely investigated attitudes toward one of the most intimate forms of contact, romantic relationships. In this study (N = 176), we expand the intergroup contact literature to examine the association between intergroup contact and, arguably, a litmus test of intergroup attitudes: receptivity to intergroup romance. We do so in Northern Ireland, a context that is historically and presently characterized by sectarian division and tension between Catholics and Protestants. Our findings reveal that intergroup contact is positively associated with receptivity to both dating and marrying an outgroup member. These associations are mediated by ingroup norms toward outgroup romances. General outgroup attitudes were also found to be positively associated with contact but, in contrast to romantic attitudes, this association was shown, for the first time, to be simultaneously mediated by ingroup norms, anxiety, empathy, and trust. In addition, strength of ingroup identification played a moderating role, with a stronger positive relationship between contact and both romantic and general outgroup attitudes among higher identifiers. The findings highlight the importance of examining attitudes toward intergroup romantic relationships, as well as understanding the different mediating and moderating mechanisms which may account for how contact influences general attitudes and romantic attitudes. In the wake of the UK vote to leave the European Union, they also serve as an important reminder of how intergroup contact can be effective in promoting peace in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Words hurt: Political rhetoric, emotions/affect, and psychological well-being among Mexican-origin youth
AN  - 2236174746
AB  - We examined the effect of political rhetoric on the targets of that rhetoric. Drawing from scholarship on anti-Mexican and anti-immigrant rhetoric found readily in various media and scholarship on emotions, we tested four hypotheses. Hypotheses 1 and 2 predicted that positive and negative political rhetoric would increase and decrease positive and negative emotions, respectively. Hypotheses 3 and 4 then predicted that emotional responses to positive or negative political rhetoric would influence perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Data collection occurred between August 2016 and June 2017 at a university in California. A sample of 280 Mexican-origin youth, defined broadly as having at least one ancestor born in Mexico or the participant themselves born in Mexico, participated in an experiment where they were randomly assigned to one of three study conditions: viewing (1) positive or (2) negative political rhetoric about immigrants and Latinos in general, or (3) neutral rhetoric as a control condition before providing qualitative responses to open-ended questions and completing measures of positive and negative affect, perceived stress, subjective health, and subjective well-being. Qualitative responses indicated that negative and positive political rhetoric elicited a range of negative emotions and positive emotions, respectively. Quantitative analysis with independent samples t-tests, ANOVA, and linear regression models found that negative political rhetoric elicited higher negative affect than positive and neutral rhetoric, and positive rhetoric elicited higher positive affect than negative and neutral rhetoric. Negative emotional responses, in turn, were associated with participants’ higher perceived stress, lower subjective health and lower subjective well-being. Conversely, positive emotional responses were associated with lower perceived stress, higher subjective health, and higher subjective well-being. Positive political rhetoric, by eliciting positive emotions, can have a salubrious effect. Altogether, these findings suggest that political rhetoric matters for the targets of that rhetoric.

T1  - Combined Forces: Thinking and/or Feeling? How News Consumption Affects Anti-Muslim Attitudes through Perceptions and Emotions about the Economy
AN  - 2207926729
AB  - This study develops a model that contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between economic motivations and anti-Muslim attitudes by analyzing the underexplored role of news consumption. Using a large-scale Dutch panel dataset (n = 2694), we test a structural equation model theoretically grounded in group conflict theory, in which the relationship between news consumption and anti-Muslim attitudes is mediated by perceptions and emotions about the economy. Findings offer sound empirical support for the hypothesized model: news consumption increases pessimistic economic perceptions and negative emotions about the economy, which in turn strengthens anti-Muslim attitudes. The mechanism, however, largely depends on the type of news outlet and genre: watching television seems more decisive than reading newspapers; moreover, especially exposure to soft and popular news formats plays a dominant role.

T1  - The fight against sexual violence
AN  - 2215486771
AB  - Seared into my memory'. This was one of the phrases animating the cover of Time magazine on 15 October 2018. It was taken from Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony to the US Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court, quotes from which were arranged into a striking cover image (see opposite). It also reflects how I and many other survivors felt about Dr Ford's testimony of sexual assault by Justice Kavanaugh, especially when juxtaposed with his statements. In an image circulated widely on social media, Kavanaugh was shown shouting into a microphone during a speech in which he called the process a national disgrace and a grotesque and coordinated character assassination', fuelled by 'anger about President Trump and revenge on behalf of the Clintons. The 2016 Brexit referendum in the UK captured growing (or perhaps increasingly explicit) anti-immigrant sentiment, as well as a backlash against experts, elites and social justice movements (which were often positioned as one and the same).

T1  - Economic Vulnerability, Cultural Decline, and Nativism: Contingent and Indirect Effects
AN  - 2190948013
AB  - ObjectiveNativism, or anti‐immigrant preferences, is increasingly evident within democratic mass publics. In this article, we explore whether economic concerns, perceptions of social decline, or some combination of the two shape these attitudes.MethodOur data are comprised of more than 8,000 survey respondents from nine Western, industrial democracies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Using mediation analysis, we test for the extent to which economic anxiety and perceptions of cultural decline exert direct and indirect effects on nativism.ResultsOn balance, the effect of economic anxiety—concern regarding job loss and negative economic assessments—on nativism is mostly indirect, affecting nativism by influencing perceptions of cultural decline.ConclusionGiven the strong association between perceptions of social decline and nativism, it appears as though anti‐immigrant sentiments draw from cultural rather than economic concerns. The story, however, does not end there. Perceptions of societal decline are strongly influenced by economic anxiety.

T1  - Exposure to Neoliberalism Increases Resentment of the Elite via Feelings of Anomie and Negative Psychological Reactions
AN  - 2190816412
AB  - For several decades now, neoliberalism has been the dominant economic and political ideology throughout large parts of the world. In many places, its rise has gone hand in hand with growing social inequality and a cultural emphasis on individualism and competition. Lately, concerns are being raised about the effects of these developments on politics and societies. The renewed rise of populism in Europe, the United States, and other countries has been attributed to economic insecurity among the working and middle classes by politicians, journalists, and academics alike. Similarly, the spread of nationalist and anti‐immigration sentiments is frequently interpreted as a result of fears over job security and perceived competition in a hostile economic climate. We examined the effect of neoliberalism on two types of prejudice (anti‐elitism and anti‐immigrant prejudice) across two studies in Germany (N = 198) and the UK (N = 173). Results show that priming neoliberalism leads to higher levels of anti‐elitism but not anti‐immigrant prejudice and that this effect is mediated by anomie and negative psychological reactions (feelings of threat, unfairness, and hopelessness). Thus, our research suggests that while neoliberalism is linked to lower social cohesion and increased outgroup derogation, this is not primarily directed against disadvantaged social groups but against those at the top.

T1  - White Danish Love as Affective Intervention:
AN  - 2340246455
AB  - Through a close reading of media reporting from 2017 to 2018 on the case of the Chinese girl Liu Yiming, who was first denied then granted residency in Denmark due to public pressure, this article analyses how regulation of family reunification involving children is negotiated in the Danish public imaginary in the context of strong anti-immigration sentiments. This imaginary projects the white Danish public as eager to love Yiming and as affectively invested in reversing the injustice done to her and her family. The article suggests, however, that the outpouring of white love, which functions as an affective intervention imbued with the promises of reversing Yiming’s deportation, is deeply embedded in exceptionalist notions of the ‘integrated’ migrant and that it works to restore an idealised image of a Danish nation defined by ‘human decency’ as a core value. Thus, the analysis raises critical questions to the politics of white love and its promise of securing social change for the ‘integrated’ migrant through collective acts of white feeling.

T1  - Through the Lens of Sexual Stigma: Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gay Parenting
AN  - 2204269790
AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice.

T1  - Overpopulation Discourse: Patriarchy, Racism, and the Specter of Ecofascism: PGDT
AN  - 2186585742
AB  - As our current climate crises increase in severity, discussions on solutions have found themselves at the forefront of mainstream media, and talked about by political actors and economic elites. While many of these solutions may seem ethical or even the answer to our ecological problem, we must take a critical look at the root causes in order to understand what actions are necessary. Without this, our discussions fall short, and tend to negatively affect marginalized communities. Family-planning programs aimed at the suppression of certain populations is one example used when discussing how to combat overpopulation in order to alleviate climate change. This superficial, Western, capitalist-driven idea and discussion, laced with sexist and racist undertones, is the discourse we will be analyzing. By employing a critical decolonial and ecofeminist lens, we will critique this discourse, and argue that it’s an all-too-common tool of deflection and scapegoating that white environmentalism employs in order to ignore historic power relations. Further, we will illuminate historical roots and trends around the family-planning movement, such as anti-immigrant sentiment, nationalism, and ecofascism.

T1  - Introduction: European Social Policy and Society after Brexit: Neoliberalism, Populism, and Social Quality
AN  - 2161096834
AB  - The narrow referendum decision for British exit from the European Union (Brexit), and its explosive political consequences, has become a lens through which decades-long tensions in European society can be viewed. The result, which was expected to be a clear Remain victory, has been interpreted as various combinations of: the unleashing of xenophobic and racist anti-immigrant sentiment; a kick back against disinterested elites by ‘left behind’ people; the fermenting of nationalist populism by political and media actors; a clash of cultural values; a rejection of ‘market is all’ globalisation in favour of national borders; or as a reaction against austerity, inequality and insecurity (Corbett, 2016; Goodwin and Heath, 2016; Hobolt, 2016; Inglehart and Norris, 2016; Kaufmann, 2016; Pettifor, 2016; Room, 2016; Seidler, 2018; Taylor-Gooby, 2017). This British-made shock has parallels in and consequences for wider European society. In the Referendum, the EU became an emblematic representation of the distrusted, remote, technocratic elites, who are said to be responsible for an unbelievably large number of societal ills. Meanwhile across Europe there are varieties of Eurosceptic populism and distrust of elites on both the right and left (Ivaldi et al., 2017).

T1  - Does a multicultural perspective shape unbiased minds? The moderating role of outgroup threat
AN  - 2132137259
AB  - The multicultural perspective is an ideological orientation that values the recognition and inclusion of diverse ethnic and cultural groups as sources of identity and culture that are favorable to society, because they promote positive intergroup relations and social equality. However, there are conditions that moderate the constructive effects such a perspective potentially yields. In this research, we used experimental procedures to examine the effects of a multicultural perspective on levels of implicit and explicit prejudice aimed at Gitanos (Spanish Roma). In Study 1, we manipulated the content of a newspaper article to generate three conditions, which were (a) the multicultural perspective, (b) the use of counter‐stereotypical exemplars, and (c) the control. In Study 2, we not only evaluated the effect of the manipulation of the multicultural perspective relative to the control, we also assessed the extent to which symbolic and realistic outgroup threats moderate the effect of a multicultural perspective on implicit prejudice. Results showed lower levels of implicit prejudice in the multicultural condition than in the control condition. The multicultural perspective effectively reduced implicit prejudice when the perceived threat was low, but yielded no such observable effect when the perceived threat was high.

T1  - From emotion to action among Asian Americans: assessing the roles of threat and identity in the age of Trump
AN  - 2571083730
AB  - The prevalence of anti-Asian and anti-immigrant rhetoric throughout the 2016 election season provides an opportunity to examine the factors shaping Asian Americans’ emotional responses to a threatening political environment. Comparing interracial trends in emotional expressions and political behavior in the 2016 Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey (CMPS), we find Asian Americans expressing fear on par with other minority groups, while expressing less anger. In a significant departure from scholarly expectations, we uncover a strong positive association between expressed fear and participation among Asian Americans. This mobilizing effect of fear distinguishes Asian Americans from other racial groups, providing better insight into the political behavior of this group in contexts of threat. We discuss how and why fear may shape Asian American participation, while mediating the effects of racial identity on action.

T1  - The print media in the construction of contemporary South Asian identities in Kenya: The Asian Weekly and AwaaZ
AN  - 2076426507
AB  - This article reads The Asian Weekly and AwaaZ, two cultural magazines that are widely associated with Kenyans of South Asian ancestry, as emblems of cultural/ political reconfigurations of contemporary racial identifications in the context of national(ist) contestations in Kenya. Following a tradition similar pan-Africanist magazines of the late colonial to post-colonial Africa, the magazines aspire to create pan-Asian identities in specific geographic and temporal zones while acknowledging the links with India and its European and North American diasporas. I argue that The Asian Weekly and AwaaZ are, firstly, popular cultural discursive spaces that are used to reify the labour, intellectual, and social heritage that Kenyan South Asians are heirs to; secondly, that these magazines bridge the gap between the past and the present, media and literature, by simultaneously archiving emerging and old memories while imagining new ones.

T1  - The Processes Underlying the Quality of Contact With the Primary Out-Group and In-Group Importance on Support for the Syrian Resettlement in a Post-Accord Context
AN  - 2110458557
AB  - The current sociopolitical climate of Northern Ireland presents an intriguing setting to examine how, following a 30-year period of sectarian violence, individuals in a society of protracted intergroup conflict respond to other victimized groups. Syrian refugees were identified as the novel out-group due to the 2,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled in Northern Ireland through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. This article was interested in understanding if the perceptions one has about the primary out-group in Northern Ireland, generalize to a novel out-group entering the setting. It was hypothesized that higher quality of contact with the primary out-group would be positively related to support for Syrian resettlement in Northern Ireland, whereas high in-group importance would be negatively related to this outcome. Moreover, the authors wanted to identify potential mechanisms through which the predictor variables influenced support for the Syrian resettlement. Participants (N = 378; M = 27.40, SD = 11.31 years; 70% female; 58% Catholic, 42% Protestant) were recruited from community groups, local businesses, and universities. The results of the chain mediation models indicated the quality of contact with the primary out-group and in-group importance were related (positively and negatively, respectively) with support for the Syrian resettlement via perspective taking and intergroup attitudes. These findings highlight that interventions to improve intergroup attitudes may facilitate support prior to and during resettlement. Application and relevance to social policies related to refugee resettlement are discussed.

T1  - Introduction: Teaching and Resistance in the Time of Trumpism
AN  - 2157781423
AB  - [...]Trump(ism) can be too easy and tempting a diversion for both students and teachers.

Yet we think it is important to honor the new, justifiable fears raised by Trump's openly racist campaign as well as his near-total absence of concern about media and public critique-his disparagement of immigrants from "shithole countries"; the equivalence he drew between white supremacist violence and non-violent anti-racist protestors in Charlottesville, VA in August 2017; his avowedly Islamophobic remarks and immigration bans; his xenophobic description, proclaimed during the news conference announcing his run for the presidency, of Mexican immigrants as "criminals and rapists"; his termination of DACA and suspension of Temporary Protected Status for many Central Americans; the anti-LGBTQ and especially anti-transgender policies and administrators he has brought to Washington 3 ; his characterization of the mainstream media as "enemies of the people"; his denial of the human causes of global warming and undermining of federal climate change policy via the appointment of Scott Pruitt to head the EPA; his rupture of the données of foreign policy and diplomacy, to name only some.

Rodriguez's "#shitholes syllabus" both imitates the generic college syllabus and echoes the phenomenon of online aggregated syllabi that formed around specific issues connected to the histories of racial violence in the United States (most notably the #Charlestonsyllabus after the 2015 murder of nine parishioners of the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church by a white supremacist and the #Fergusonsyllabus, which contextualized the murder of an unarmed black teenager by a police officer and the subsequent protests in Ferguson, MO in 2014).

[...]the semester, Schultz's students created their own collective artistic response to the current moment: a sculptural anti-border-wall which they installed in the college's art building, and which asked viewers to think critically about the racist cultural and social implications of US immigration policies.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect among children: The role of social dominance orientation and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2064683830
AB  - Research has provided evidence that the effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction are not limited to the outgroup one has contact with (primary outgroup). Rather, they extend to secondary outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation (secondary transfer effect; Pettigrew, 2009, Social Psychology, 40, 55). We aimed to provide the first empirical evidence for the emergence of the secondary transfer effect among children. Majority (Italian) and minority (with an immigrant background) elementary schoolchildren were administered a questionnaire including measures of contact with the primary outgroup (minority children for the majority, majority children for the minority), prejudice towards the primary outgroup and towards a dissimilar secondary outgroup (disabled children), and social dominance orientation. Results revealed that among the majority group, contact with the primary outgroup had indirect associations with reduced prejudice towards the secondary outgroup. Specifically, we found evidence for sequential mediation by social dominance orientation and prejudice towards the primary outgroup. No secondary transfer effects emerged among minority group members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings, arguing for the importance of identifying the core processes driving the secondary transfer effect.

T1  - The impact of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility for harm on victim groups' perceptions of justice, power, and intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2047415574
AB  - Acknowledgement of responsibility for in‐group harmdoing is considered a precondition for reconciliation. However, we know little about its impact on victim groups. Using a mixed methods approach, in two studies in Bangladesh we examined the role of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility on intergroup outcomes. Study 1 used an open‐ended survey to assess Bangladeshis' perceptions about acknowledgement and denial of responsibility for the mass violence committed by the Pakistani army on Bangladeshis during the 1971 war. Study 2 experimentally examined the effects and the potential mechanisms (emotional reactions, perceived injustice, and relative power) through which acknowledgement and denial of responsibility impact two intergroup outcomes: out‐group animosity and willingness for contact. Both studies demonstrated the importance of anger and perceived injustice as mediators of the effects of acknowledgement and denial of responsibility on intergroup outcomes. We draw implications for theory and for strategies to address past victimization across different contexts of conflict.

T1  - Do you think like me? Perceived concordance concerning contact and culture maintenance on international students’ intentions for contact with the host-society
AN  - 2069025538
AB  - An experimental study was conducted to analyse if perceived concordance on intergroup contact and culture maintenance might influence the attitudes and behavioural investment of international students toward the majority members. The mediating role of metastereotypes and some intercultural communication factors (self-disclosure, contact avoidance, and certainty) were investigated. The participants were 114 international students in Italy (mean age = 22.83), who were categorized into different levels of concordance with respect to culture maintenance and intercultural contact. Our findings showed that perceived concordance with respect to culture maintenance influenced international students’ desire for contact with majority members. Conflict avoidance mediated the relationship between concordance with respect to culture maintenance and behavioural investment. No other mediational relationships were statistically significant. This research is one of a small number of studies examining how concordance of acculturation preferences can influence the intergroup attitudes and intentions of international students. Specifically, the most positive outcomes were produced when majority members were perceived as sharing ideas concerning culture maintenance with international students. Interventions that aim to improve majority–minority relations should consider not only the preferences of minority members with respect to acculturation, but also the way minority members perceive the expectations of majority members and, more notably, the interplay between preferences and perceptions.

T1  - And What About Siblings? A Longitudinal Analysis of Sibling Effects on Youth’s Intergroup Attitudes
AN  - 1993516063
AB  - Within the process of political socialization, the family is of particular importance. Apart from parents, however, little is known about the role of other close family members. The present study examined if siblings affect each other’s intergroup attitudes (i.e., intolerance towards immigrants, social dominance orientation). Drawing on a sample of 362 sibling dyads (older siblings: Mage = 17.77, 53.6% female; younger siblings: Mage = 13.61, 61.3% female), the results showed that older siblings’ intergroup attitudes predicted younger siblings’ attitudes, but this effect was moderated by gender. Specifically, older siblings’ intolerance and social dominance orientation were only found to affect their younger sisters, yet not their younger brothers. Although younger siblings’ intergroup attitudes had no main effect on older siblings, a significant moderation by age indicated that younger siblings affected older siblings’ social dominance orientation with increasing age. These moderation effects of age and gender were not mediated by the quality of family relationships. The findings also remained the same when parental intergroup attitudes were taken into account. While siblings were generally identified as an important agent of political socialization in youth, the results also highlight the necessity to further examine the mechanism that either facilitate or hinder sibling effects.

T1  - Excerpt from The New Immigrant Whiteness: Race, Neoliberalism, and Post-Soviet Migration to the United States
AN  - 2258149574
AB  - Mapping representations of post-1980s immigration from the former Soviet Union to the United States in interviews, reality TV shows, fiction, and memoirs, Claudia Sadowski-Smith shows how this nationally and ethnically diverse group is associated with idealized accounts of the assimilation and upward mobility of early twentieth-century arrivals from Europe. As it traces the contributions of historical Eastern European migration to the emergence of a white racial identity that continues to provide privileges to many post-Soviet migrants, the book places the post-USSR diaspora into larger discussions about the racialization of contemporary US immigrants under neoliberal conditions. "The New Immigrant Whiteness" argues that legal status on arrival — as participants in refugee, marriage, labor, and adoptive migration — impacts post-Soviet immigrants’ encounters with growing socioeconomic inequalities and tightened immigration restrictions, as well as their attempts to construct transnational identities. The book examines how their perceived whiteness exposes post-Soviet family migrants to heightened expectations of assimilation, explores undocumented migration from the former Soviet Union, analyzes post-USSR immigrants’ attitudes toward anti-immigration laws that target Latina/os, and considers similarities between post-Soviet and Asian immigrants in their association with notions of upward immigrant mobility. A compelling and timely volume, "The New Immigrant Whiteness" offers a fresh perspective on race and immigration in the United States today.

T1  - REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOR OF STUDENTS IN GEORGIA
AN  - 2123183255
AB  - The presented paper is based on the sociological research conducted by the Institute of Demography and Sociology in recent years that considered studying the regularities and specifics of socio-demographic modernization of a family. The research has found that in the post-Soviet Georgia, prolonging the learning process, along with the economic factor, has had a major impact on the students` reproductive behavior. It has been confirmed that the in public’s youngest, intellectual section, the traditional attitude towards the family and marriage relationships is deeply rooted. A sharply negative attitude was identified with respect to giving birth to an extramarital child. The young people believe that a family shall only be created based on love, not on mercenariness. It was found that for them, the process of study, career promotion and marriage are the factors which are incompatible. Therefore, a small share of students were observed to have a wish to get married within the next 5 years. For most of all, the reluctance to take a decision to get married it associated, most of all, with the difficulty to choose a partner. This has been conditioned both by the intention to become economically independent as well as by the psychological immaturity for creating a family. It was identified that this is also an outcome of the gaps existing in the family upbringing and educational system. In particular, along with training the youth in different regular subjects, they are not trained for family relationships. This shall be taken into account for determining family policy measures and developing educational programs. Mass media are able to make great contribution to that process. Unlike their parents’ generation, students intend to have more children that will not worsen the country’s demographic situation. While determining a future child’s gender, no gender-specific bias has been observed so far. It was also identified that the parents` influence on marriage and on determining the number of children to be born has been dramatically reduced; however, the feeling of obligation towards the senior generation has not gone. Also, it was found that in the light of intense globalization, despite vaster opportunities to leave one’s own country, the intense interaction with different cultures has, presumably, further highlighted the feeling of ethnic identity.

T1  - Les femmes musulmanes et le « droit de choisir librement »
TT  - Muslim Women and the « Right to Freely Choose » Las mujeres musulmanas y el « derecho de elegir libremente »
AN  - 2095791045
AB  - Tout en soulignant qu’il s’avère illusoire de vouloir séparer les situations personnelles des conditions historiques et politiques de leur émergence, cet article propose une réflexion critique de la notion de libre choix, que l’auteure inscrit dans un réseau de facteurs macrosociaux tels que les tensions internationales ou encore la violence et la pauvreté structurelles. La notion de « libre choix » possède une charge idéologique qui se reflète dans la distinction souvent établie entre les femmes occidentales libérées et la femme musulmane dépourvue de libre choix et victime passive de l’oppression patriarcale. Le libre choix tend aujourd’hui à (re)devenir un critère discriminatoire permettant de distinguer les sociétés les « plus civilisées » (choix et liberté pour les « Occidentales ») de celles qui le sont moins (contrainte et servitude pour les « Orientales »). La violation du libre choix des femmes peut alors contribuer à légitimer l’intervention des industries humanitaire et militaire pour « sauver les musulmanes », comme cela a été le cas dans la guerre d’Afghanistan, à la suite des événements tragiques du 11 septembre 2001. Qui a le pouvoir de réduire « l’Autre », et particulièrement les musulmanes, à des sujets assujettis incapables d’émerger comme sujets agissants ? Des musulmanes souffrent d’un libre choix limité, mais ceci est-il réductible à l’islam ? Le libre choix des Occidentales relève-t-il d’un idéal fantasmé ? Faudrait-il plutôt investiguer la notion de libre choix dans sa complexité intrinsèque reliée aux relations de pouvoir ? Réduire les vies poignantes et tellement complexes des femmes musulmanes à une question de choix plus ou moins libre et éclairé est d’une totale insatisfaction pour l’anthropologue. Afin de mieux saisir cette complexité, l’auteure puise dans son travail ethnographique s’échelonnant sur une vingtaine d’années en milieu rural égyptien pour souligner l’importance du travail (micro)ethnographique qui permet de dépasser les généralités et les simplicités galvaudées par certains médias et romans à sensation (« pulp nonfiction ») qui font et défont l’opinion publique. L’auteure compare ces généralités essentialisantes avec des exemples de vies socialement complexes et ethnographiquement riches de villageoises égyptiennes.Alternate abstract:Are Muslim women veiling out of choice or is this form of dress a dark sign of coercion by patriarchal families, religious traditions, or authoritarian states ? Should women be allowed to choose what they wear or do states that want to protect individual freedom, secular values, or the security of others have the right to legislate what women can and cannot wear ? Yet choice is also regularly deployed as a key symbol in the culture wars that pit the freedoms of the liberated West against the oppressions suffered by « the Muslimwoman » (in Miriam Cooke’s 2007 felicitous phrasing) to justify everything from border control and immigrant policing to military invasions and development projects. This article examines the value of « freely choosing » that is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to argue, both on theoretical grounds and in light of the everyday dilemmas of women in one Egyptian village in which I have worked for over twenty years, that this ideal rests on a false confidence that one can know when a choice is freely made and an ideological conviction that freedom is the ultimate good. On a theoretical level, this view of choice ignores the most basic insights of Michel Foucault about the ways we are all made into subjects and subjects of power – the social process he calls subjectivation. And it ignores the critique some anthropologists have made of the ways liberal feminism excludes desires for social or moral conformity from the definition of agency. Looking closely at the ways some women and girls in this Egyptian village talk about veiling and arranged marriage, two of the practices critical to judgments of « the Muslimwoman’s » lack of choice, I argue that it is better to understand how choices are produced within specific configurations of power and culture to which women are subjected, and within which they become subjects of their own lives than to bask in the comforting fantasy produced by popular pulp nonfiction memoirs about abused Muslim girls that Western women in contrast do have choice, do have freedom, and do not suffer.Alternate abstract:Subrayando el hecho que es ilusorio querer separar las situaciones personales de las condiciones históricas y políticas donde surgen, este artículo propone una reflexión crítica de la noción de libre elección, que la autora inscribe en el conjunto de factores macro-sociales como las tensiones internacionales o la violencia y la pobreza estructural. La noción de « libre elección » posee una carga ideológica que se refleja en la diferenciación, con frecuencia empleada, entre las mujeres occidentales liberadas y la mujer musulmana desprovista de la libertad de elección y victima pasiva de la opresión patriarcal. La libertad de elección actualmente tiende a (re)devenir un criterio discriminatorio que permite distinguir las sociedades « más civilizadas » (elección y libertad para las « Occidentales ») de las que son menos (coerción y servidumbre para las « Orientales »). La violación de la libre elección de las mujeres puede así contribuir a legitimar la intervención de las industrias humanitaria y militar para « salvar a las musulmanas », como ha sido el caso en la guerra de Afganistán a raíz de los hechos trágicos del 11 de septiembre. ¿ Quién tiene el poder de reducir al « Otro » y particularmente a los musulmanes, a sujetos sometidos incapaces de surgir como sujetos actuantes ? Las musulmanas sufren una limitada libertad de elección, ¿ pero acaso esto se reducible al Islam ? ¿ La libre elección de las Occidentales es una idea fantasmagórica ? ¿ Deberíamos más bien investigar la noción de libertad de elección en su complejidad intrínseca ligada a las relaciones de poder ? Reducir las vidas conmovedoras y tan complejas de las mujeres musulmanas a una cuestión de elección más o menos libre e informada, es algo totalmente insatisfactorio para la antropóloga. Para captar mejor dicha complejidad, la autora recurre a su trabajo etnográfico, que se escalona durante unos veinte años en el medio rural egipcio, para subrayar la importancia del trabajo (micro)etnográfico que permite contornear las generalidades y simplicidades trilladas de ciertos medios y novelas sensacionalistas (« pulp nonfiction » que hacen y deshacen la opinión pública. La autora compara dichas generalidades esencialistas con ejemplos de vidas socialmente complejas y etnográficamente ricas de campesinas egipcias.

T1  - Victims or Intruders? Framing the Migrant Crisis in Greece and Macedonia
AN  - 2057257455
AB  - Representations of immigrants in media are considered a major factor in shaping immigration attitudes. In the context of the migrant crisis in Europe, we analyze how news content about the migrant crisis is framed by media in Greece and Macedonia, two neighboring countries on the Balkan migrant route. By using framing theory as analytical framework, this study applies Benson's (2013) paradigmatic "security/threat" and "humanitarian/victim" frame dichotomy in migration coverage to the concept of issue framing. The content analysis of six print media outlets in both countries (N = 660) investigates the variety of subframes and framing devices within the scope of the two overarching frames, finding dominant portrayals of refugees as illegal trespassers, potential terrorists and social burdens in both countries. However, positive depictions of migrants are more common in Greece, which we attribute to the absence of ideological consensus and differences between the countries' political and media systems.

T1  - Majority members’ endorsement of the acculturation integrationist orientation improves their outgroup attitudes toward ethnic minority members: An electronic-contact experiment
AN  - 1939922414
AB  - An electronic intercultural contact intervention was deployed in the present study to enhance Israeli majority students' level of Integrationist endorsement toward Israeli Ethiopian minority members. The study intervention involved synchronous text-chat across three sessions administered online over three weeks, and required pairs of majority students (n = 44) and Ethiopian students (n = 44) to work collaboratively on planning a social-cultural trip and come up with a 'travel guide' that satisfies the needs of the interacting students' cultural groups (Integration). The study evaluated both short-term (one week) and long-term (six weeks) effects of the intervention on majority members' outgroup attitudes. The study findings revealed that, compared to majority controls (n = 41), participants in the intervention condition reported a greater decrease in intergroup bias and anxiety in the short- and long-terms. A mediation effect of intergroup anxiety was also found; the intervention reduced majority members' intergroup anxiety in the short-term which was related to reduced long-term intergroup bias. These encouraging findings highlight that carefully designed cooperative electronic-contact programs tailored to promote majority individuals' endorsement of the Integrationist orientation, can offer an efficacious route to acculturation researchers interested in promoting this strategy, improving in turn majority members' outgroup attitudes toward minorities.

T1  - Romanians' current perception of threat from immigrants in a context of co-ethnic migration: assessing the role of intergroup conflict and active/passive contact
AN  - 2008942928
AB  - This paper investigates the predictors of natives' perception of the immigrant threat in Romania, an interesting site given immigrants' marginal presence in the total population and the sizeable proportion of co-ethnic immigrants. Yet the interplay between nationalism and religion shapes an ideological frame that favours unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants that challenge the Romanian identity forged along ethnic and religious ties. The authors used regression to analyse immigrant threat according to several dimensions: cosmopolitanism, group conflict and intergroup contact. In order to reflect specificities of this particular context, the latter dimension is conceptualized so as to include active and passive contact with immigrants. This distinction is relevant because of immigrants' low presence in Romania. Findings suggest that variables from conflict theory explain more of the variation in the perceived threat, while indirect contact through mass-media exposure to immigrant content has the potential to reduce the perception of immigrant threat.

T1  - Tweetment Effects on the Tweeted: Experimentally Reducing Racist Harassment
AN  - 1928618790
AB  - I conduct an experiment which examines the impact of group norm promotion and social sanctioning on racist online harassment. Racist online harassment de-mobilizes the minorities it targets, and the open, unopposed expression of racism in a public forum can legitimize racist viewpoints and prime ethnocentrism. I employ an intervention designed to reduce the use of anti-black racist slurs by white men on Twitter. I collect a sample of Twitter users who have harassed other users and use accounts I control ("bots") to sanction the harassers. By varying the identity of the bots between in-group (white man) and out-group (black man) and by varying the number of Twitter followers each bot has, I find that subjects who were sanctioned by a high-follower white male significantly reduced their use of a racist slur. This paper extends findings from lab experiments to a naturalistic setting using an objective, behavioral outcome measure and a continuous 2-month data collection period. This represents an advance in the study of prejudiced behavior.

AB  - In 2012 Amsterdam Gay Pride Canal Parade hosted a Turkish Boat, organized by Dutch citizens of Turkish decent. The newspaper articles consistently emphasized what an advancement this was for the Turkish migrants, considering their 'cultural background.' Simultaneously, public opinion on the former immigrants from Turkey and Morocco as intolerant towards LGBTI people and how they are 'gay bashing on the streets' was still present. The scholarship on homonationalism and gay imperialism has been dealing with questions of Orientalism, islamophobia and racism since the 2000s. The question of agency within this scholarship, however, was not dealt with extensively. This paper will engage with this question by mapping out Dutch homonationalism and focusing on how this specific context produces historically contingent subject positions - such as gay, lesbian, Muslim, Turkish or Moroccan-Dutch - that are hierarchized within the Dutch public sphere. None of them is innocent of power or neutral, the power configurations among these subject positions lay the ground of agency upon which the subject can act.

T1  - On Cologne: Gender, migration and unacknowledged racisms in Germany
AN  - 1925337524
AB  - The events of Cologne represented a turning point in the debate about refugees in Germany. After the ‘long summer of migration’ and the much anticipated German Willkommenskultur, the reported sexual assaults in Cologne sparked a discussion about the dangers of ‘political correctness’, ‘too liberal’ immigration policies and, once again, ‘Muslim patriarchy’. ‘The terror of Cologne’ prompted the political and media mainstream to defend the ‘German value’ of gender equality, after decades of political indifference towards sexual violence. However, instead of addressing the inadequate laws governing sexual offences, the debate focused on expelling those who were believed to endanger post-feminist Germany. Cologne illustrates the intersectional workings of racism and anti-feminism in a discursive climate where misogyny has allegedly been overcome and can only be traced in racialised Others. Whilst feminism is usually deemed extreme, ideological and religion-like, mainstream media outlets and politicians were very quick to declare what happened in Cologne an attack on German gender norms. Calls to teach refugees about the ‘European value’ of gender and sexual equality became louder. The long overdue rape legislation was tightened and linked to immigration law with a conviction of sexual assault leading to deportation in addition to criminal sanctions. Whilst Cologne advanced post-feminist ‘common-sense’ narratives that view gender equality as integral to German society, anti-racist feminism was denounced as ideological, extreme and dangerous for the nation. We will argue that Cologne needs to be theorised within a broader frame of German racial and gender politics, and we will particularly explore the relationship between race-denial and anti-feminism.

T1  - An Analysis of Portrayals of Crime, Criminals, and Cops in Icelandic Televsion
AN  - 1949736150
AB  - This work examines what defines a crime, a criminal offender, and a “good or quality cop” from an Icelandic television perspective. Here, as a scholar of crime and popular culture and a critical member of a viewing audience that watches “cop shows,” I make commentary on the similarity and differences in Icelandic and American crime dramas. I find most notably that: American crime shows are obsessed with violent street crime, hyper-masculine policing attitudes, and getting the “bad guy” at all costs. Icelandic shows on the other hand, focus on corporate and governmental deviance, alternative and empowered gendered models of policing, and procedural justice. If television shows are an effective means of presenting and forcing debate on issues of crime and justice, then we have much that we can learn from the (televised) model of Icelandic crime shows and presentations of policing.

T1  - When School-Shooting Media Fuels a Retributive Public: An Examination of Psychological Mediators
AN  - 1873914736
AB  - Despite evidence suggesting proactive responses to youth crime are advantageous, juvenile justice relies heavily on punitive practices. This discrepancy is in part affected by public preferences for retribution, which are skewed by sensationalized media portrayals of youth crime. This experiment (N = 174) explores how youth crime media exposure translates into retributive attitudes by testing the hypothesis that media portrayals of school shootings increase retributive attitudes indirectly through either dehumanization or mortality salience. Statistical analyses suggest that dehumanization mediates the relationship between school-shooting media portrayals and retributive attitudes toward crime-involved youths. To promote support of less retributive juvenile justice policies, advocates may benefit by focusing emphasis on humanizing elements of young offenders.

TT  - Sud Africains blancs de classe moyenne traversant Le Cap: rencontres mobiles avec des étrangers; Sudafricanos blancos y de clase media trasladándose a través de Ciudad del Cabo: encuentros móviles con desconocidos
AN  - 1848148454
AB  - Drawing on photo-elicitation interviews with 60 middle-class, white residents of two privileged suburbs of Cape Town, this paper focuses on the particularities and the potential effects of mobile encounters with strangers. Starting from discourses about different means of transportation, it is demonstrated, first, that middle-class, white South Africans prefer cars over public transit not only for safety reasons or matters of practicality but also to circumvent interactions with those whom they consider to be strangers. Yet, based on the ambiguous and ambivalent sensations of fear, shame, guilt, sympathy, apathy and anxiety provoked by glances and glimpses of strangers on drives through the city, it is clarified that particular forms of visual encounter which develop on-the-go can stimulate privileged residents of a very unequal city to develop new engagements with strangers. By analyzing how unfocused interactions through the windshield add up to focused interactions at home and at work, it is shown, more specifically, how different types of encounters at different places complement each other to encourage middle-class, white residents to see the humanity of those whom they had considered to be strange or dangerous before.

T1  - Valuing diversity in Spain and Canada: The role of multicultural ideology in intergroup attitudes and intentions to reduce inequalities
AN  - 1878076691
AB  - Multicultural ideology proposes that group memberships should be not just acknowledged but also valued in order to accommodate diversity and attain equality. In three studies conducted in Spain and Canada we analyzed, using different measures, the relationship between multicultural ideology on the one hand and prejudice, support for social policies, and motivation for social change on the other hand. In Spain we focused on responses to Gitanos (Spanish Roma) and, in Canada, on First Nations people. Results showed that multicultural ideology was related in both cases to lower prejudice and higher support for social policies to support the minority group and motivation for social change. The internal motivation to control prejudice was an important mediator of this relationship in both countries. In contrast, the way in which social identities are represented played a different role as a function of country: whereas a dual identity representation played a mediating role in Canada, a common identity representation was the mediator in Spain. These results support the importance of valuing cultural diversity to harmonize intergroup relations and to reduce inequalities between majorities and minority groups.

T1  - Predicting support for collective action in the conflict between Turks and Kurds: Perceived threats as a mediator of intergroup contact and social identity: GPIR
AN  - 1830218141
AB  - Two studies investigated the role of perceived realistic and symbolic threats in predicting collective action tendencies, and in mediating effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action in the context of an intractable conflict. Extending earlier research on collective action, integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding collective action and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of collective action can help to explain collective action tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts.

T1  - (How) does positive and negative extended cross-group contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes?
AN  - 1735657053; 201536816
AB  - Knowing that fellow ingroup members have cross-group contact can affect how people think, feel, and behave towards an out-group. Previous research on extended contact focused almost exclusively on positive cross-group interactions, neglecting the fact that extended contact can also be negative. In this contribution, we introduce negative extended contact and investigate how both forms of extended contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes. In two cross-sectional studies (N1=286, N2=237), we found evidence that positive and negative extended contact uniquely predict intergroup attitudes, and that direct cross-group contact mediates this effect. In Study 2, we also provide initial evidence that extended contact might either prepare for or impair direct contact by changing ingroup norms and intergroup self-efficacy, which in turn influence feelings of intergroup anxiety.

T1  - The Influence of Episodic and Thematic Frames on Policy and Group Attitudes: Mediational Analysis
AN  - 1718067792; 201531354
AB  - An experiment examined how episodic and thematic political message frames affect attitudes toward older adults and Social Security. When exposed to messages about abolishing Social Security, participants exposed to episodic frames were significantly more likely to endorse message-consistent attitudes than participants exposed to a thematic frame. In mediation analyses, an episodic frame featuring a counterstereotypical exemplar increased endorsement of individual responsibility for retirement planning, which then led to more negative attitudes toward Social Security. These effects did not occur with a stereotypical exemplar in an episodic frame. The same mediated pathway influenced attitudes toward older adults in a more complex manner. Results provide support for individual responsibility attributions as a mediating mechanism underlying the effects of certain episodic frames. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1708525439; 201528961
AB  - The current study content analyzes the 345 most viewed U.S. television shows within 12 separate television seasons spanning the years 1987 to 2009. Using multilevel modeling, the results from this comprehensive content analysis then are used to predict national-level racial/ethnic perceptions (between the years 1988 and 2008) with data from the American National Election Studies (ANES). Content analysis results reveal severe underrepresentation of Latinos, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, and a tendency to depict ethnic minorities stereotypically (e.g., overrepresentation of hyper-sexualized Latino characters). Multilevel-modeling analysis indicates that both the quantity and quality of ethnic media representations contributes to Whites' racial attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rush, Rachel, and Rx: Modeling Partisan Media's Influence on Structural Knowledge of Healthcare Policy
AN  - 1728661647; 201534847
AB  - Examining the impact of various media sources on knowledge has a long tradition in political communication. Although much of the extant research focuses on the impact of traditional media on factual knowledge, research is expanding to include a variety of media sources and multiple dimensions of knowledge, in addition to understanding processes that better explain these relationships. Using a nationwide, opt-in online survey (n = 993), we examine the relationship between partisan media and structural knowledge, which assess how interconnected people see political concepts. Utilizing understanding of the Affordable Care Act as the content area of interest, we examine whether exposure to partisan media has differential effects on attitudinal ambivalence -- holding both positive and negative attitudes toward an object -- based on the political ideology of the respondent, and whether this impact of ambivalence influenced structural knowledge. Our results show that exposure to attitude-consistent media decreased attitudinal ambivalence. This exposure to attitude-consistent media results in a positive indirect effect on structural knowledge through this decrease in ambivalence. We find the reverse effect for use of attitude-inconsistent media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Political affiliation, collective self-esteem and perceived employability of immigrants: Inducing national identity polarizes host-nation employers
AN  - 1559005951; 201432150
AB  - Host-nation employers' political affiliation and national identity both may be relevant to seeing immigrant job-seekers as employable. However, whether national identity alters differences in links between political affiliation and evaluations of immigrants is not well articulated, and this includes a potential for national identity to either bolster or lessen harshness toward immigrant job-seekers. Moreover, research has yet to identify psychological mechanisms that could transmit a conjoint effect of political affiliation and national identity. In this study, we examined the capacity of national identity to accentuate links between political affiliation and perceived employability of immigrants. Liberal and conservative employment experts (human resource professionals and managers) were experimentally primed to elicit either a personal or national (U.S.) identity, and measures of attitudes toward immigrant job-seekers were collected. Results suggested a polarizing effect of national identity: conservative employers viewed immigrants as less employable when primed with national identity, while liberal employers rated immigrants as more employable. Among conservatives, priming national identity also resulted in greater collective self-esteem -- feelings of self-worth derived from group membership. Moreover, increases in collective self-esteem mediated the link between primed national identity and less perceived employability among conservatives. Overall, this research contributes to emerging literature by suggesting that the capacity of national identity to either bolster or lessen harshness toward immigrants may depend on political affiliation. In addition, we suggest that transient changes in collective self-esteem can result from priming national identity, and that such changes may transmit links between national identity and evaluations of immigrants among conservatives.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1543801794
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: "empathy," "cultural openness," "in-group bias," and "intergroup anxiety." British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Can Fostering Children's Ability to Challenge Sexism Improve Critical Analysis, Internalization, and Enactment of Inclusive, Egalitarian Peer Relationships?
AN  - 1543801785
AB  - Elementary school-age children (N = 137, 70 boys, ages 4-10) were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of lessons aimed at increasing the inclusiveness of peer relations and improving children's ability to identify bias in media. Children in the pro-social condition were taught to identify and respond to undesirable/unfair social behaviors (e.g., teasing), whereas children in the pro-egalitarian condition were taught to respond to these same behaviors, with additional attention to gender bias (e.g., teasing about gender role nonconformity). After five lessons, children completed immediate and 6-month delayed measures of egalitarian attitudes, intergroup liking, responses to hypothetical peers' sexist remarks, and ability to identify sexism in media. The lessons did not differentially affect children's gender egalitarian attitudes and intergroup liking. As expected, however, children in the pro-egalitarian condition were better able to identify sexism in media and to respond to peers' sexist comments than were children in the pro-social condition.

T1  - Benefits and barriers to sports participation for athletes with disabilities: the case of Malaysia
AN  - 1692288171; 201521457
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to explore the benefits and barriers influencing participation for athletes with disabilities from a developing country (Malaysia). Two independent studies were undertaken: Study 1 included a sample of 123 athletes (95 males, 28 females) who participated in the 2006 Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC Games); Study 2 involved focus group discussions with 14 elite athletes. The athletes ranged in age from 15 to 59 years. Data were collected through a questionnaire (Study 1) and focus group discussions (Study 2). The primary reasons for participation in sport were achievement/challenge (58%) and competency/skill development (41%). The main barriers faced by the athletes were structural (facilities, equipment, funding) and the negative attitude from the government, public and media. However, despite these difficulties the majority of athletes were keen to continue to compete. Further work is required to ensure athletes with disabilities are provided with similar opportunities to athletes without disabilities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Muslim communities attitudes towards and recruitment into the British police service
AN  - 1559007723; 201433228
AB  - Recent UK media reports have often portrayed Muslim communities in a negative light (Allen, 2010). Indeed, the frequent media focus of Muslim's being arrested for counter-terrorism offences have been reported in great length. Yet the Muslim community remains diverse and is one of the longest established UK communities within Britain. However, previous studies show that there remains a tense relationship with the police and Muslim communities (Awan, 2011) with negative attitudes held by many young British Muslims towards the police (Kundnani, 2009), and indeed negativity remains stronger from young people from minority ethnic communities. The focus and aim of this research was to gather perceptions from the Muslim community in Birmingham as regards whether they would choose or recommend a career within the police service. Thus the objective for the study was to try and get a better understanding of Muslim perceptions about police recruitment. This article reports on the findings and implications of a small-scale study conducted in 2011 comprising of interviews with two Muslim groups namely the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities from Birmingham (in the UK), where 20 people were interviewed in four groups consisting of (5) participants. The categories included Young People (aged between 15 years and 18 years); Community Leaders; Mosque Representatives and Female Groups (aged between 18 years and 30 years) which aimed to identify and gather the views of Muslim communities in respect to their views about choosing a career with the police service. Analysis revealed that the Muslim community responded in a fairly homogeneous way: they had a lack of trust towards the police and also issues were raised about the legality of counter-terrorism policing operations; a perception that the police service were a racist organisation and that the police had failed to engage with the Muslim community in Birmingham which had left a negative experience of Muslim communities and the police.3 Recommendations to improve the image and recruitment into the police service include more pro-active work with local communities and the use of community policing as a means to reach out to otherwise 'hard to reach groups'.

T1  - Combating the mental health stigma with nostalgia
AN  - 1448995371; 201342739
AB  - We report research implicating nostalgia as an intrapersonal means of warding off the stigmatization of persons with mental illness. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person with mental illness improves attitudes toward the mentally ill. In Experiment 1, undergraduates who recalled an encounter with a mentally ill person while focusing on central (vs. peripheral) features of the nostalgia prototype reported a more positive outgroup attitude. This beneficial effect of nostalgia was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with a mentally ill person subsequently showed a more positive outgroup attitude. Results supported a serial mediation model whereby nostalgia increased social connectedness, which predicted greater IOGS and outgroup trust. IOGS and outgroup trust, in turn, predicted more positive outgroup attitudes. We ruled out alternative explanations for the results (i.e., mood, perceived positivity, and typicality of the recalled outgroup member). The findings speak to the intricate psychological processes underlying the prejudice-reduction function of nostalgia and their interventional potential. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudice toward American Muslims: An Integrated Threat Analysis
AN  - 1718067858; 201530688
AB  - This study explores prejudice toward American Muslims. Prejudice is conceptualized using Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory (ITT). ITT identifies four kinds of threat that can lead to prejudice: realistic threats, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Data were gathered in the United States (N = 281) among self-identified Christians. Findings confirm: 1) a positive correlation between real and symbolic threats, and stereotypes, 2) increased contact with an immigrant group, in this case Muslims, is negatively correlated with perceptions of real and symbolic threat, and 3) levels of prejudice differ based on level of education. Theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between prejudice, interpersonal contact/communication, and education are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Distancing Disease in the Un-black Han Chinese Politic: Othering Difference in China's HIV/AIDS Media
AN  - 1567046396; 201435877
AB  - This article seeks to understand the meanings associated with HIV/AIDS in China's media and examine how the 'distance' many urban Chinese people feel toward HIV/AIDS is sustained, despite major changes in public health campaigns that indicate otherwise. It draws on evidence from China's press and public health media, which remain overlooked in studies on attitudes toward HIV even though 90 percent of urban Chinese learn about HIV from the media, making it supremely important in informing urban understandings of the virus. In particular, the article examines how susceptibility to infection has become associated with racial and gender characteristics through the early portrayal of Africans in China's media reports on HIV/AIDS. It suggests that the geographical and corporeal signification of Africa and Africans establishes an understanding that connects the 'dark' consequences of HIV with skin color and a supposed lack of sociomoral and economic development, thus enabling Chinese audiences to perceive themselves as distant from or even immune to the virus. Finally, the article suggests that if attitudes toward HIV/AIDS are to be addressed, then the racialized attitudes in media toward HIV need to be analyzed, challenged, and changed.

T1  - Affective mediators of intergroup contact: A three-wave longitudinal study in South Africa
AN  - 964187094; 201207308
AB  - Intergroup contact (especially cross-group friendship) is firmly established as a powerful strategy for combating group-based prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Great advances have been made in understanding how contact reduces prejudice (Brown & Hewstone, 2005), highlighting the importance of affective mediators (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). The present study, a 3-wave longitudinal study undertaken among minority-status Colored high school children in South Africa (N = 465), explored the full mediation of the effects of cross-group friendships on positive outgroup attitudes, perceived outgroup variability, and negative action tendencies via positive (affective empathy) and negative (intergroup anxiety) affective mediators simultaneously. The target group was the majority-status White South African outgroup. As predicted, a bidirectional model described the relationship between contact, mediators, and prejudice significantly better over time than either autoregressive or unidirectional longitudinal models. However, full longitudinal mediation was only found in the direction from Time 1 contact to Time 3 prejudice (via Time 2 mediators), supporting the underlying tenet of the contact hypothesis. Specifically, cross-group friendships were positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes (via affective empathy) and perceived outgroup variability (via intergroup anxiety and affective empathy) and were negatively associated with negative action tendencies (via affective empathy). Following Pettigrew and Tropp (2008), we compared two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship between intergroup anxiety and affective empathy over time. Time 1 intergroup anxiety was indirectly negatively associated with Time 3 affective empathy, via Time 2 cross-group friendships. We discuss the theoretical and empirical contributions of this study and make suggestions for future research. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Anti-Slavic imagery in German radical nationalist discourse at the turn of the twentieth century: a prelude to Nazi ideology?
AN  - 1531933839; 201423301
AB  - By applying methods of cognitive metaphor theory, Jaworska examines metaphorical scenarios employed in the discourse of anti-Slavism, which featured prominently in radical nationalist propaganda in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. She does so by analysing metaphorical expressions used to refer to the Polish population living in the eastern provinces of Prussia, in the so-called Ostmark. Her article is based on an analysis of a range of pamphlets and newspaper articles written by some of the leading figures of two nationalist organizations: the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband) and the Eastern Marches Society (Ostmarkenverein). The main research questions it addresses are: What kind of metaphoric scenarios were used to depict the Polish minority, and to what extent were the metaphorical patterns of anti-Slavic imagery similar to those employed in the antisemitic propaganda of the Nazi era? Is there a discursive continuity between the radical nationalism of imperial Germany and the National Socialism of the Third Reich at the level of metaphorical scenarios? Ultimately, Jaworska attempts to contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying radical and essentially racist attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial Identity and Gender as Moderators of the Relationship Between Body Image and Self-esteem for African Americans
AN  - 1081861887; 201238052
AB  - This study explored whether multiple dimensions of racial identity and gender moderated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem for African American men and women (N=425) using an intersectional approach. Centrality (strength of identification with racial group), private regard (positive feelings about racial group), public regard (positive feelings others have about racial group), and gender moderated the relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem for a sample of men (n=109) and women (n=316) college students from three regions of the United States. Body dissatisfaction was related to lower self-esteem only for those African Americans for whom race was less central to their identities. High private regard and low body dissatisfaction were synergistically associated with higher self-esteem. Similarly, low public regard and high body dissatisfaction were synergistically related to lower self-esteem. There was a positive main effect for assimilation ideology (emphasis on similarities between African Americans and Western society) on self-esteem; however it was not a significant moderator. The relationship between body dissatisfaction and self-esteem was stronger for women than for men. This study extends our knowledge of the ways in which racial attitudes and gender shape how African Americans experience their bodies and are related to self-esteem. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudicial Distribution of the HPV Vaccine
AN  - 1030869732; 201229848
AB  - Release of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on the market sparked controversy: Teen girls, sex, politics, religion, and cancer intersected in the push to inject the vaccine into arms. The focus of this paper is the mythology of the vaccine, and the means in which various standpoints have created a discourse about HPV vaccine. I draw my findings from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public discussion and debate about the vaccine, including such literature as biomedical journal articles, newspaper articles and opinion pieces, blogs, internet sites devoted to the HPV or other vaccines (both pro and anti), and pharmaceutical company literature, to explore manipulation in the discursive practices of collective representation. I do not intend to argue against HPV vaccine as a protection against cervical or other cancers. Certainly the vaccine is to be credited for saving women's lives, particularly in areas where access to preventive health care is low. Rather, this work explores the collective representations surrounding the vaccine. At issue is a medical intervention, yet this intervention is laden with social meanings. The HPV vaccine is the only vaccine to be targeted toward women. This targeting has resulted in a language of manipulation and, in the case of school-based mandates, outright coercion. The discourse is filled with a variety of threats to further the aim of powerful social groups, including those interested in vaccinating women, such as pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and public health, and those in protest of the vaccine, such as some fundamentalist religious groups and vaccine safety organizations.

T1  - Class, ethnicity, gender and Latino entrepreneurship
AN  - 887747560
AB  - For Salvadorans, strong communities characterized by ethnic cohesion and ethnic-based social capital are essential features that help establish Salvadoran entrepreneurship, especially in light of their lower class status and their culturally rooted distrust of market institutions, which hinder their access to class-based resources.  "Institutional gatekeepers" (169) confirm entrepreneurs' perception that structural opportunities and federal support for Latino small business is limited and generally ineffective; at the same time, government leaders and gatekeepers suggest that Latinos need stronger leaders and community organizers to combat the barriers to enterprise that Latinos face, which include the recent economic downturn of the economy and a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - THE LATINO CYBER-MORAL PANIC PROCESS IN THE UNITED STATES
AN  - 907929171; 201125068
AB  - In the past few decades, the anti-immigrant sentiment in the United States has been influenced, in part, by the massive immigration of Latinos to the United States. The internet technology in the Web 2.0 age offers a new medium in which this anti-immigrant movement can appear and create what Cohen calls a 'moral panic', which we claim to has become a Latino cyber-moral panic. Of a subsample taken from 170 anti-immigrant websites, the authors examine the role of internet in the creation of a cyber-moral panic against Latinos in the United States in which they find the classic stages of moral panic must be modified and updated. Facilitated by the internet, a 'call for civil action' stage is added to the classic moral panic process in which donations and direct civil and political action are sought from online visitors. Recycled information is spread via other anti-immigrant websites, blogs, forums, and other social media, helping to accelerate the moral panic process due to the ability to quickly spread information, reach those who have access to online technologies and hardware, the assumption of anonymity, etc. Using the updated moral panic process model, the authors apply these stages to the current nativist movement which has resulted in a wave of hate crimes against immigrants, several pieces of new anti-immigrant legislation, and fostered an environment widespread discrimination, oppression, and dehumanization against the contemporary 'folk devils', or Latinos in the United States.

T1  - Community Perceptions And Treatment-Seeking Behaviour Regarding Reproductive Tract Infections Including Sexually Transmitted Infections In Lao PDR: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 896180851; 201121072
AB  - Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTF), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Rhetoric of Ethnic Identity Construction Among Taiwanese Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1037876707; 201232013
AB  - The construction of ethnic identity is often influenced by the surrounding culture and in some cases anti-immigrant sentiment in a new country. Because Taiwanese identity is already troubled and unsettled before immigration to the United States, the construction of ethnic identity within this diasporic Taiwanese community becomes a very challenging process that deserves scholars' attention. The authors argue that the combination and interaction of both physical and virtual spaces created by the Internet will produce a distinctive environment where ethnic identity among diasporic Taiwanese immigrants will be formed. They use a qualitative textual analysis method to examine websites and discussion groups on the Internet to discover the process, strategies, and characteristics of constructing a Taiwanese American identity through the Internet.

T1  - When extended contact opens the door to future contact: Testing the effects of extended contact on attitudes and intergroup expectancies in majority and minority groups
AN  - 902083830; 201122124
AB  - The present research tests whether extended contact can predict positive intergroup expectancies, as well as positive intergroup attitudes, among majority and minority group members. Our results replicate and extend prior work by showing that extended contact predicts both positive intergroup attitudes and intergroup expectancies among both majority (Spanish) and minority (immigrant) participants, even when controlling for direct friendship and the quantity and quality of prior intergroup contact. These effects are partially mediated by intergroup anxiety, perceived ingroup norms, and perceived outgroup norms, and the positive effects of extended contact on intergroup attitudes were also partially mediated by the inclusion of ingroup in the self. Additionally, the mediating role of outgroup norms was stronger among immigrant participants than among Spanish participants. Implications of these findings and the value of extended contact for promoting positive intergroup expectancies and preparing people for future contact are discussed.

T1  - Race, Racial Resentment, Attentiveness to the News Media, and Public Opinion Toward the Jena Six
AN  - 862596171; 201109644
AB  - Objective. We outline the role of race, racial resentment, and attentiveness to news in structuring public opinion toward the prosecution of the Jena Six, the name given to six African-American high school students who beat a white student, five of whom were subsequently charged with attempted second-degree murder. Method. We rely on a telephone survey of 428 registered voters collected in the aftermath of the protests in Jena, Louisiana. Results. Public reactions were heavily filtered by race and associated with measures of racial resentment. African Americans followed news about the protests more closely, believed race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute, and believed the decision to prosecute was the wrong decision. Racially conservative white respondents were less likely to believe race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute and were more likely to believe that the decision to prosecute was the right decision. Consistent with theories of agenda setting and framing, attentiveness to the news influenced perceptions regarding the importance of race in the decision to prosecute but not whether the decision was the right decision. Conclusions. At least within the context of the Deep South, race and racial attitudes continue to be an important predictor of public reactions to racially charged events. Attentiveness to the news influenced the lens through which events were interpreted, but not perceptions of whether the outcome was the right decision. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of Spanish-Language Media on Latino Public Opinion and Group Consciousness
AN  - 902083233; 201122263
AB  - Objective: This article determines if the use of Spanish-language media among Latinos influences public opinion on various policy issues and group consciousness. Methods: Using a 2004 national public opinion survey of U.S. Latinos, a multivariate analysis is run to determine the effect of language media preference on immigration policy, abortion, same-sex marriage, and three measures of group consciousness. Results: I find more frequent use of Spanish-language media leads to more liberal attitudes toward immigration, but has no effect on opinions toward abortion and same-sex marriage. I also find increased use of Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness. Conclusions: The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness among Latinos by reinforcing roots in Latin America and the commonalities among Latinos of varying national origin.

T1  - People's perceptions of HIV/AIDS as portrayed by their labels of the disease: the case of Botswana
AN  - 1429627563; 201338399
AB  - It is typical of societies to come up with their own labels or names to any phenomenon that may befall them in the course of their life time. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been no exception to this practice. In Botswana most of these labels are either in Setswana or English whereby an Eglish expression is simply adopted and used to refer to HIV/ AIDS. This study looks at the different labels or names that have been used to refer to HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It is an attempt to provide insights into perceptions of HIV/AIDS by the local communities portrayed through the naming of this disease. The study demonstrates how, through the different labels, the local communities started in denial distancing themselves from this disease and in some cases associating AIDS with ailments already known to them, cultural practices and taboos. Some of these labels further demonstrate the negative attitudes that may have fuelled HIV-related stigma in the country. Based on the informants' responses, the paper further attempts a categorisation of these labels influenced by different attitudes to HIV/AIDS, some of which are self-perpetuating and may continue to be a hindrance to the fight against the disease.

T1  - Child Abuse in a Disciplinary Context: A Typology of Violent Family Environments
AN  - 1037880849; 201234112
AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify and validate types of violent family environments based on child abuse in a disciplinary context. The study is original in that it simultaneously takes into account the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the parental role as it relates to the degree of family violence in a child's life. Cluster analyses were performed on a representative sample of 3,148 families. The Abusive profile applied to families who reported at least one severe assault on a child within the past year. This profile also had the highest levels of domestic violence, psychological aggression, and corporal punishment. The Harsh profile is nevertheless similar to the Abusive profile, despite the fact that these families reported no severe assault. The key difference is the lower score levels: the attributes are the same, but less intense. The Nonabusive profile accounted for the families with the lowest rates of domestic and parental violence, together with a negative attitude towards corporal punishment and a heightened awareness of the consequences of violence. Although the families who matched the Paradoxical profile reported very little violence, they are the least aware of the consequences of violence and the most in favor of corporal punishment. The four profiles were replicated with another cluster analysis performed on an independent representative sample of 2,465 families. Then the profiles were compared with regard to the variables used to create the clusters and other variables theoretically associated with the appearance of maltreatment. These validation methods enhance the credibility of the proposed typology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reassessing the Impact of Hispanic Stereotypes on White Americans' Immigration Preferences
AN  - 818800043; 201072239
AB  - Objectives. There is disagreement in the literature on immigration attitudes regarding the relative importance of ethnic stereotypes and more general cultural and economic concerns about increasing immigration in the formation of those attitudes. We argue that the impact of stereotypes relative to these other factors may have been underestimated for a variety of reasons. Methods. impact of stereotypes on immigration preferences in data from the Multi-Ethnic Module of the 2000 General Social Survey. Because the dependent variables analyzed herein are ordinal, we estimate ordered logistic regressions that correct for diagnosed hetereoskedacticity. Results. Statistical analyses confirm that negative stereotypes are a significantly larger predictor of ethnicity-specific immigration preferences relative to general attitudes about immigration. Intervening variables analyses also suggest that the impact of stereotypes has been underestimated relative to cultural and economic anxieties because these variables significantly mediate its observed impact. Conclusions. results suggest that ethnic stereotypes are significantly more important in determining immigration preferences among Americans than has been reported in previous research.

T1  - Interracial public-police contact: Relationships with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and behavior
AN  - 822521967; 201072821
AB  - In a sample of Flemish police officers (n = 172), we examined whether interracial public-police contact is associated with police officers' racial and work-related attitudes and self-reported behavior. Complementing previous studies, it was revealed that interracial contact (both positive and negative) is related to prejudiced behavior toward immigrants via the mediating role of racial attitudes. Moreover, intergroup contact was also shown to be related to police officers' organizational citizenship behavior toward colleagues and superiors via their perceptions of organizational fairness. We elaborate on the severe impact of negative contact as well as the applied consequences of our findings within police organizations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Yes We Can!: Prejudice Reduction Through Seeing (Inequality) and Believing (in Social Change)
AN  - 1910818168
AB  - We investigated the effect of differential perceived efficacy to reduce racial inequality (in the context of increased awareness of illegitimate in-group advantages) on White Americans' intergroup attitudes and antidiscrimination behavior. White American university students read a passage describing the underrepresentation of African Americans in their university's faculty and then wrote letters to the university administration in support of appointing more African Americans to the faculty. We experimentally varied feedback concerning efficacy to change institutional racism. Before writing their letters, participants were told that there was a low, moderate, or high chance that their efforts would be effective. Later in the experiment, participants' perceived efficacy to influence their university system was measured. Intergroup attitudes improved and antidiscrimination actions increased among participants with higher perceived efficacy in comparison with participants with low perceived efficacy. Collective guilt partially mediated the effects of efficacy beliefs on antidiscrimination actions and fully mediated the effects of efficacy beliefs on intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Constructive feedback in cross-race interactions
AN  - 758124200; 201056727
AB  - In two experiments, White college students provided a local high-school student with feedback on her substandard college admissions essay, via electronic mail. Motivation to provide appropriate feedback was manipulated by alleging comparison to experts or novices. Experiment 1 compared feedback to White versus Black recipients, with the expectation that accountability would attenuate previously observed positivity biases in cross-race feedback. Experiment 2 manipulated concern about being prejudiced by providing false scores on an Implicit Associations Task (IAT)-type task; this experiment examined whether accountability plus attenuated concern about prejudice could encourage feedback to Blacks that was objectively helpful. Feedback characteristics included evaluative connotation, communication style, subjective feedback helpfulness and objective feedback quality. Findings generally supported these hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings for intergroup contact situations, including the potential pitfalls that face feedback-givers responding to superior performance.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives' Opinions Toward Immigration in North Carolina
AN  - 758121612; 201057035
AB  - This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - Immigration in the 2008 Virginia presidential election: A cultural issue remains puissant despite an economic crisis
AN  - 754048532; 201054353
AB  - In 2006 and 2007, many analysts expected that immigration would be one of the top domestic issues in the 2008 campaign. However, in the 2008 presidential general election, immigration issues were never a major topic between candidates John McCain and Barack Obama. This was partially because McCain has more moderate views toward immigration reform than the passionate anti-immigration faction of the Republican Party. Prior research suggests that an issue in a presidential campaign can remain influential even when the media and campaigns are not discussing or addressing the issue, even when the candidates or parties do not differ greatly on the issue. In a survey of Virginia residents conducted just before the November election, immigration attitudes were a differential factor between McCain and Obama. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Does a common ingroup identity reduce intergroup threat?
AN  - 754037940; 201049577
AB  - Intergroup threat is regarded as a cause of negative outgroup attitudes; however, little research has attempted to examine ways of reducing intergroup threat. Two studies examine the effectiveness of a superordinate identity for reducing intergroup threat. It was predicted that when two groups were aware of a shared identity, intergroup threat would be lowered and attitudes would become more positive. In Study 1, perceptions of common identities among Black and White students were related to decreases in intergroup threat and increases in positive outgroup attitudes. In Study 2, when their shared identity as Americans was made salient, Democrats and Republicans experienced less threat and more positive outgroup attitudes compared to when political party identities alone were salient. In both studies, intergroup threat acted as a mediator of the relationship between common identity and outgroup attitudes, suggesting that a common identity increases positive outgroup attitudes by first reducing intergroup threat.

T1  - A Paradox of Integration? Interracial Contact, Prejudice Reduction, and Perceptions of Racial Discrimination
AN  - 743066950; 201043232
AB  - A random digit dialing survey (N = 596) investigated the relationship between quantity and quality of interracial contact and Black South Africans' perceptions of racial discrimination in postapartheid society. Results showed that harmonious contact was associated with lower levels of perceived collective discrimination, an effect that was mediated by racial attitudes and personal experiences of racial discrimination. The implications of the survey's findings are discussed in relation to two models of social change in social psychology (cf. Wright & Lubensky, 2008): a model of change grounded in the rehabilitation of the prejudiced individual and a model of social change grounded in collective awareness of, and resistance to, systemic inequality.

T1  - Speaking With a Nonnative Accent: Perceptions of Bias, Communication Difficulties, and Belonging in the United States
AN  - 743065601; 201042833
AB  - Whereas past research on nonnative accents has focused on the attitudes and perceptions of listeners, the current research explores the experiences of speakers with nonnative accents. Two studies investigated the role of nonnative accents and their strength in perceptions of stigmatization and discrimination, problems in communication, and feelings of social belonging. Study 1 demonstrated that individuals with nonnative accents experienced two different, but related facets of stigmatization: expectations of stigmatization and problems in communication. Study 2 extended this research by examining the effects of the experience of stigma and communication problems associated with nonnative accents on social belonging in the United States The results showed that speaking with a nonnative accent, but not a regional native accent, was significantly associated with feeling less belonging, and this difference was mediated by perceived problems in communicating.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 743057741; 201043757
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

T1  - The Role of Cultural Inertia in Reactions to Immigration on the U.S.-Mexico Border
AN  - 60351557; 201017711
AB  - Assimilation and multiculturalism are often contrasted as opposite interethnic ideologies about cultural integration. Here, we address models of assimilation and multiculturalism and how group identity influences attitudes toward immigrants. One overlooked issue concerns the dynamic processes involved in integration. It is proposed that cultural inertia, defined as the desire to avoid cultural change, or conversely, to continue change once it is already occurring, can account for a number of seemingly discrepant findings. In particular, cultural inertia predicts that majority groups should prefer assimilation type models, whereas minority groups should prefer multicultural models. Resistance to change is the mediating process. Cultural inertia is used as a model to understand discrepant attitudes toward assimilation and multiculturalism across different groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Political groups in contact: The role of attributions for outgroup attitudes in reducing antipathy
AN  - 60355474; 201017261
AB  - In two cross-sectional surveys and one experiment, we tested the hypothesis that attributions for outgroup ideologies would mediate the relationship between quality of contact and reduced prejudice. In Study 1, a British sample (N = 85) rated their perceptions of, and attributions for, their political outgroup's (i.e., conservative or liberal) belief system. Supporting our hypothesis, the relationship between contact and outgroup attitudes was mediated by rationality attributions - attributions that outgroup members obtained their views via rational thought processes. Study 2 was a replication of Study 1 with an American sample (N = 229) and expanded construct measurement. The results of Study 2 replicated those of Study 1, showing support for rationality attributions as a mediator of the contact-prejudice link. In Study 3 (N = 132), we experimentally manipulated the priming of past positive or negative outgroup contact with individual outgroup members and measured the proposed mediational constructs with respect to that outgroup encounter. Results further supported the role of rationality attributions as mediators of the contact-prejudice link. The implications of these findings for perceptions and relations between antagonistic ideological groups are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]
