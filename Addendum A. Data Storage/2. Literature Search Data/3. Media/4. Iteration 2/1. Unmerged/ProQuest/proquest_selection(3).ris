T1  - Linkage from Self-Sacrifice to Hope Through the Intervening Roles of Perceived Family Support and Attitudes to Aging in Chinese Older Adults
AN  - 2699221882
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between self-sacrifice and hope as well as the possible intervening roles of perceived family support and attitudes to aging in this relationship among Chinese older adults. A total of 475 older adults participated in the current study. They completed measures related to self-sacrifice, hope, perceived family support, and attitudes to aging. Attitudes to aging measured the extent to which older adults hold positive and negative attitudes toward aging in three domains of physical change, psychological growth, and psychosocial loss. The results showed that self-sacrifice was positively associated with older adults’ hope. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived family support mediated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that attitudes to physical change moderated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope, and attitudes to psychological growth moderated the relationship between perceived family support and older adults’ hope. Specifically, the association between self-sacrifice and hope was stronger for older adults with less positive attitudes to physical change than for those with more positive attitudes to physical change. The association between perceived family support and hope was stronger for older adults with more positive attitudes to psychological growth than for those with less positive attitudes to psychological growth. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between self-sacrifice and hope and can aid in designing effective interventions aimed at improving older adults’ hope.

T1  - Fraternity Membership and Negative Racial Attitudes among U.S. College Students
AN  - 2689912123
AB  - Over the years, race‐related incidents involving Greek letter organizations (GLOs), especially fraternities, continue to arise despite the ensuing controversy and negative media attention that inevitably follow such incidents. The present study examines whether there is an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes given a range of relevant psychological, sociological, and political theories about ethnoracial attitudes. Building on insights from microclass research on attitudinal structuring and drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Freshmen (N = 2,817), results of linear regression models indicate that GLO membership is associated with heightened negative ethnoracial attitudes, particularly among white male students. Moreover, a measure of ethnoracial group affiliation partially mediates this effect. This latter finding suggests that among the various ethnoracial attitude theories, group position theory may be better formulated to explain an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes, given its consideration of both ingroup boundary formation and organizations. The results also support microclass processes and suggest future research to more clearly account for pre‐occupational structuring that later feeds into occupational processes.

T1  - Public “agendamelding” in the United States: assessing the relative influence of different types of online news on partisan agendas from 2015 to 2020
AN  - 2691165446
AB  - Using Gallup survey data and online news from 2015 to 2020, this study explored the degree to which audiences “meld” agendas from a wide array of news sources for the five most popular issues in the U.S.: the government and politicians, immigration, the economy, race relations, and healthcare. Overall, audiences of varying ideology had agendas that were congruent. Media agendas also appeared congruent, except on the issue of the economy. Conservative news media had a strong influence on audience issue salience. Horizontal (all partisan) and vertical (nonpartisan) media were in a virtual tie for influence among audiences. Despite an erosion in media trust, conservatives were receptive to issue salience from news media of all types, including liberal media. Liberals did not mirror elite media issue saliences, but were influenced by all other types of media, including conservative media. Moderates were influenced by the entire media landscape, to a somewhat even degree. Four out of the five issues studied here showed varying news media influence with no one media group nor ideology owning the agendas of an issue. The exception observed here was the issue of healthcare, which was influenced exclusively by liberal media for all three ideological groups.

T1  - Reducing social distance caused by weight stigma: Nostalgia changes behavior toward overweight individuals
AN  - 2673616621
AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward the overweight, can lead to discriminatory practices, as well as increase overweight individuals' vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and low self‐esteem. We propose that a nostalgia induction can attenuate weight stigma. Participants identified an overweight individual, before writing about an interpersonal encounter with that individual, characterized by either central (e.g., “keepsakes” and “childhood”) or peripheral (e.g., “wishing” and “daydreaming”) features of the construct “nostalgia.” Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported more positive feelings and beliefs toward overweight individuals in general. Moreover, nostalgia influenced behavior: Nostalgic (vs. control) participants reduced their social distance when anticipating an interaction with an overweight individual. The effect of nostalgia on all three outcomes (i.e., positive feelings, beliefs, and behavior) was mediated by greater social connectedness, which in turn was associated with higher inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust.

T1  - The Role of Just World Beliefs in Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2666121422
AB  - This study investigated whether people’s personal belief in a just world (BJW) is linked to their willingness to physically distance themselves from others during the COVID-19 pandemic. Past research found personal BJW to be positively related to prosocial behavior, justice striving, and lower risk perceptions. If social distancing reflects a concern for others, high personal BJW should predict increased interest in social distancing. If social distancing reflects a concern for one’s personal risk, high personal BJW should predict decreased interest in social distancing. Results of a pre-registered internet-based study from Germany (N = 361) indicated that the higher people’s personal BJW, the more they generally practiced social distancing. This association still occurred when controlling for empathy, another significant predictor of social distancing. There were no mediation effects of empathy and risk perception. The findings extend knowledge on the correlates of social distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic which could be used to increase compliance among citizens.

T1  - Reframing everyday life. Implications of social distancing in Italy
AN  - 2646104571
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the measures of social distancing and home confinement have been perceived and experienced in the Italian socio-cultural context, how they reshaped everyday life and which are their social implications.Design/methodology/approach>The study was exploratory and interpretative in nature and a qualitative research design was adopted accordingly. A total of 60 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted.Findings>Research findings highlight the fact that the boundaries of everyday practices have been completely reframed during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Italy. Informants show that scarcity of personal spaces, intertwined with the collapse of the boundaries between private and professional life, and also the lack of physical contact, resulted in a complex management of different social roles and in a stress overload.Originality/value>There are no prior studies that critically analyse the lived experiences of individuals during the lockdown and the impact of home confinement on their meaning-making processes. This paper sheds light on the reframing of everyday life, thereby enhancing our understanding of a novel issue that is of primary concern for social scientists.

T1  - Effect of Social Exclusion on Social Maladjustment Among Chinese Adolescents: A Moderated Mediation Model of Group Identification and Parent–Child Cohesion
AN  - 2622755185
AB  - Social exclusion is a covert and widespread social behavior. Different from previous studies on the role of internal and social functions in the relationship between social exclusion and maladjustment, the study aims to explore the influence of individual interaction on the individual–group relationship as well as the impact of relationship changes on adolescent social maladjustment. Based on an integration of social information processing theory and social identification theory, we analyzed the association between social exclusion and adolescents’ social maladjustment, especially the mediating role of group identification and the moderating role of parent–child cohesion. Participants were 1,506 Chinese adolescents (Mage = 16.18 years, SD = 0.81). The results demonstrated that the association between social exclusion and adolescent social maladjustment was partly mediated by group identification. Parent–child cohesion was found to moderate the direct effect and first half of mediating path after splitting gender variable. Our findings expand the extant insights on how social exclusion could contribute to adolescent social maladjustment and highlight the important role of father in later adolescence development.

T1  - Knowledge, attitude, and practice related to the COVID-19 pandemic among undergraduate medical students in Indonesia: A nationwide cross-sectional study
AN  - 2621916545
AB  - Introduction 
The potential role of medical students in raising awareness during public health emergencies has been acknowledged. To further explore their potentials as public educators and role models for the communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of these students toward COVID-19.
 Methods 
An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students in Indonesia. Socio-demographics characteristics, social interaction history, information-seeking behavior, as well as knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were collected through a self-reported questionnaire. A p-value of <0.05 indicated statistical significance.
 Results 
Out of 4870 respondents, 64.9% had positive attitude and 51.5% had positive practice toward COVID-19, while only 29.8% had adequate knowledge. Knowledge was slightly positively correlated with attitude and practice (ρ = 0.074 and ρ = 0.054, respectively; both p<0.001), while attitude was weakly correlated with practice (ρ = 0.234, p<0.001). Several factors including age, sex, place of residence, institution type, academic level, family income, history of chronic illness, prior volunteering experience, and perceptual awareness on COVID-19 were significantly associated with either knowledge, attitude, and/or practice toward COVID-19. Furthermore, health institution’s and the government’s press releases, as well as health expert opinions were deemed as the most reliable sources of COVID-19-related information–yet trivially none of these sources were associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice in the study population.
 Conclusion 
Many undergraduate medical students in Indonesia had positive attitude and practice against COVID-19, yet only a few had adequate knowledge. This warrants further interventions to keep them updated with COVID-19 evidence to maximize their potentials in raising public awareness on COVID-19.

T1  - Understanding Public Attitudes to Hate: Developing and Testing a U.K. Version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale
AN  - 2605163669
AB  - Against the backdrop of an increase in reported hate crimes, we present the development of a U.K.-focussed instrument designed to evaluate the nature of public beliefs about hate crime, legislation, offenders and victims. In Study 1, 438 participants completed an Anglicized version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Factor analyses revealed three subfactors: Denial (high scores represent a denial of hate crime severity and need for legislation), Compassion (high score reflect compassion toward victims and affected communities) and Sentencing (higher scores reflect more punitive attitudes). In Study 2 (N = 134) we show that scores on Denial are positively associated with those on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), ideologies known to be associated with prejudice. Compassion was negatively associated with these ideologies. Mediation analyses showed that Big Five personality traits Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness predicted Denial and Compassion via RWA, whereas Agreeableness and Openness predicted scores via SDO, consistent with a dual-process motivation model of hate crime beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of hate crime beliefs and the importance of understanding public attitudes which may support undesirable social norms and influence jury decision making in trials of hate related offenses.

T1  - A push–pull–mooring view on technology-dependent shopping under social distancing: When technology needs meet health concerns
AN  - 2604520576
AB  - Due to COVID-19, we have witnessed an accelerated digitalisation process in shopping activities as consumers embrace a variety of digital technologies that facilitate their 'in-home' or contactless shopping lifestyle. This study aims to investigate the emerging phenomenon of technology-dependent shopping under social distancing. Exploratory factory analysis and structural equation modeling are employed for data analysis. Anchored on the push–pull–mooring framework, our findings suggest that consumers' health concerns (push factors), technology needs (pull factors), task–technology fit considerations (mediators) and pandemic-induced psychological states (mooring factors) are all critical contributors to the adoption of technology-dependent shopping with varied explanatory powers. The findings also provide guidelines for retailing operators to direct consumers towards the contactless shopping channel as a responsive strategy to the pandemic.

T1  - The State Owes Us: Social Exclusion and Collective Actions of China’s Bereaved Parents
AN  - 2579054014
AB  - China’s one-child policy has come to an end, but its ramifications continue. This article explores the issue of bereaved parents who lost their only child as an unintended consequence of the one-child policy and provides a social and political analysis of their suffering and resistance. Chinese social institutions and cultural norms traditionally discriminate against bereaved parents, excluding them from social support and social relations. As a result, bereaved parents often cut ties with their extended families, networks, and other social relations; they are stigmatized, marginalized, and isolated. However, through the internet and social media, these parents have begun forging new social relations and associations among themselves. They mobilize collective protests fueled by shared grief and the moral appeal of their patriotic sacrifice for the state, demanding official government recognition and compensation for their losses. This article treats bereavement as a subject of analysis and shows how state power shapes or even damages people’s everyday lives in a specific family-centered cultural context.

T1  - Left Out—Feelings of Social Exclusion Incite Individuals with High Conspiracy Mentality to Reject Complex Scientific Messages
AN  - 2605135488
AB  - We investigated linguistic factors that affect peoples’ trust in science and their commitment to follow evidence-based recommendations, crucial for limiting the spread of COVID-19. In an experiment (N = 617), we examined whether complex (vs. simple) scientific statements on mask-wearing can decrease trust in information and its sources, and hinder adherence to behavioral measures. In line with former research on social exclusion through complex language, we also examined whether complexity effects are mediated via feelings of social exclusion. Results indicate that negative effects of text complexity were present, but only for participants with a strong conspiracy mentality. This finding informs how to increase trust in science among individuals with a high conspiracy mentality, a population commonly known for its skepticism towards scientific evidence.

T1  - Connected while apart: Associations between social distancing, computer-mediated communication frequency, and positive affect during the early phases of COVID-19
AN  - 2583392149
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered life for individuals worldwide. Specifically, at the time of data collection (late April 2020), most forms of face-to-face interactions were limited and, in some cases, prohibited, as close contact with others increases the rate of transmitting the virus. As social beings, engaging in social distancing may have negative consequences on well-being. However, many individuals maintained their social connections by means of computer-mediated communication (CMC), such as hosting FaceTime happy hours or family reunions. Utilizing a nationally representative sample of 985 adults from the United States, this study investigated the association between social distancing adherence and positive affect and the extent to which this association might be mediated by CMC frequency. Results did not indicate a direct effect of social distancing adherence on positive affect. However, an indirect effect between these two variables occurred when mediated by CMC frequency. Specifically, greater social distancing adherence predicted greater frequency of CMC, which predicted greater positive affect. These findings held controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, relationship status, and income. Results suggest that despite social distancing, CMC may be a beneficial way to engage with others during and, perhaps, beyond COVID-19.

T1  - Arguing about social distancing and family relationships
AN  - 2583392047
AB  - With the COVID-19 pandemic, families are having to coordinate their behaviors to face new challenges, such as negotiating the social distancing measures that the family will or will not take in their daily interaction. This study utilizes Family Communication Patterns Theory to examine conversations that young adults reported having with their family members about social distancing measures and what factors predicted the outcomes of these disagreements. A family’s level of conversation orientation and the interaction of conversation orientation and conformity orientation predicted change in relational closeness due to the argument and the perceived positivity level of predicted outcome value levels for future interaction with these family members. Additionally, level of conformity orientation predicted perceived relational harm from disagreements about social distancing.

T1  - Public attitudes toward pandemic triage: Evidence from conjoint survey experiments in Switzerland
AN  - 2586552129
AB  - The question of how to implement medical triages has become highly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be actively discussed. It is important to know how members of the general public think about this issue. For one, knowledge about the public's standpoint can help resolve important questions where ethical considerations are by themselves not sufficient, for instance whether the patient's age should matter. It can also help identify if more communication with the public about medical ethics is needed. We study how members of the Swiss public would allocate intensive medical care among COVID-19 patients using data from two original conjoint survey experiments conducted in Switzerland in the context of the first and second pandemic waves in 2020 (N = 1457 & N = 1450). We find that our participants would not base triage decisions on the patient's age. However, they do give much importance to the patient's behavior prior and during illness, discriminate against non-nationals, and assign only a relatively small and inconsistent role to medical considerations. Our findings suggest that there is a need for more communication with the public about the ethics of medical triage.

T1  - Effects of digital use on trust in political institutions among ethnic minority and hegemonic group – A case study
AN  - 2575534529
AB  - The current study was based on data from a nationwide Annual Social Survey to investigate the correlation between types of Internet usage (seeking information, e-government use, e-mail, social media and peer-to-peer Internet telephony) and trust in political institutions in Israel's Jewish majority and Arab minority. Trust in government, parliament, and political parties was found to be significantly higher among Jews than Arabs. Our findings show that first level digital divide reflected in Internet use vs non-use does not correlate with political trust. Among Internet users we found different patterns of association between digital uses and trust in political institutions, which may presumably be explained by different group status. E-government use and social media use were positively correlated with political trust only among Jews. Seeking information and e-mail use were negatively associated with trust in political institutions only among Arabs. Peer-to-peer Internet telephony was negatively correlated with trust in government among both groups. Our important finding is that in spite of the processes of digitization, the effects of digital use on political trust are still relatively marginal. In both groups, the primary predictor of political trust is attitudes toward the functioning of different public institutions.

AB  - Australia is highly polarised about its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, with the available literature indicating that public, political, and media discourse routinely constructs them as culturally incompatible with the broader society. These discourses present refugees and asylum seekers as undesirable ‘others’ and in turn, their deservingness of protection becomes contingent upon arbitrary notions of who gets to belong (and why). Rhetoric about what it means to be Australian pervade these discussions, however little is known about the various linguistic functions these ideas serve. This paper presents the findings arising from Critical Discourse Analysis of interviews with 24 Western Australians. Findings revealed that notions of ‘Australian values’ were regularly called upon to further arguments that both deny and advocate for the nation's acceptance of people seeking asylum. While some constructed ‘Australian values’ as incompatible with asylum seekers’ cultural practices and beliefs, others asserted that open, compassionate, and charitable treatment of people seeking asylum is a key facet of ‘being Australian’. Examined with consideration of the literature on Social Exclusivism and Cosmopolitan Acceptance, I discuss the discursive features of these contrasting ideas, emphasising key implications for both societal and scholarly understandings of Australia’s ongoing asylum debate.

T1  - Social and parasocial relationships during COVID-19 social distancing
AN  - 2553719745
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic provided an extraordinarily unique opportunity to investigate how sudden, involuntary alterations to social routines influenced not just social relationships, but also parasocial relationships with fictional characters and celebrities. Results from a four-wave panel survey administered during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 166) revealed that social relationships maintained their stability during social distancing, particularly among participants who increased mediated social engagement with friends and those low in attachment anxiety. Parasocial closeness with media personae increased over time, suggesting that favorite media personae became more meaningful as participants engaged in social distancing. Parasocial closeness increased with greater intensity among participants who increased parasocial engagement, reduced face-to-face social engagement with friends, increased mediated social engagement with friends, and those low in attachment anxiety. Results are discussed in terms of the potential influence of increased mediated social engagement with real-life friends on the parasocial processing of celebrities and fictional characters.

T1  - Information processing of social exclusion: Links with bullying, moral disengagement and guilt
AN  - 2572615215
AB  - The Social Information Processing (SIP) theory and the Social Cognitive Theory of Moral Agency were integrated to investigate the associations between SIP and bullying, guilt, and moral disengagement. Participants were 341 children and early adolescents (Mage = 11.14). Two social exclusion vignettes were administered to assess three SIP steps (step 2: Attribution of hostile intent; step 3: Selection of antisocial goals, and step 4: Generation of aggressive responses). Guilt was assessed through five vignettes. A self-report measure was used to assess moral disengagement and peer nominations were used to assess bullying perpetration. Moderated mediation analyses were performed to test the hypotheses. Findings indicated that attribution of hostile intent was associated with selection of antisocial goals, which in turn, was associated with the generation of aggressive responses among participants with high levels of bullying and low levels of guilt and moral disengagement. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical relevance.

T1  - A Populist Paradox? How Brexit Softened Anti-Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 2543259356
AB  - Recent political contests across Europe and North America have been propelled by a wave of populist, anti-immigrant resentment, and it was widely expected that these populist victories would further fan the flames of xenophobia. This article reports the results of an experiment around the Brexit referendum, designed to test how populist victories shape anti-immigrant attitudes. The study finds that anti-immigrant attitudes actually softened after the Brexit referendum, among both Leave and Remain supporters, and these effects persisted for several months. How could a right-wing, populist victory soften anti-immigrant attitudes? The authors use causal mediation analysis to understand this ‘populist paradox’. Among Leavers, a greater sense of control over immigration channelled the effects of the Brexit outcome onto anti-immigrant attitudes. Individuals' efforts to distance themselves from accusations of xenophobia and racism explains the softening of attitudes towards immigration observed among both Leavers and Remainers.

T1  - The role of social distance in the relationship between police-community engagement and police coercion
AN  - 2520067233
AB  - While there is a considerable body of evidence on the influence of individual and situational, and to a lesser extent community factors, on police use of force, little is known about the influence of police agency factors on use of force by police. Greater use of community policing approaches has recently been recommended for U.S. policing agencies, in the wake of a series of high-profile police-involved deaths of predominantly African American citizens. However, there is limited empirical evidence that community policing can influence or impact the use of force by police. The current study uses an online survey of Australian police officers to examine whether frequency of community engagement affects officers’ attitudes towards coercive and non-coercive policing responses to a vignette, and whether social distance might explain this relationship. Regression analyses demonstrated that community engagement was positively related to endorsement of non-coercive policing responses and negatively related to endorsement of coercive policing responses. Social distance mediated the former relationship, but not the latter. These results suggest that community policing approaches may increase the propensity for non-coercive policing responses, and that a reduction in social distance to the community is one pathway through which this occurs.

T1  - Theorizing race, marginalization, and language in the digital media
AN  - 2593906648
AB  - Digitization of the communication medium has transformed the mute, marginalized 'audience' into a heterogeneous and credible content 'producer.' Drawing on this dynamics and operation of the digital media, it has urged the need to re-theorize 'marginalization' and 'race.' Hence, this paper critiques the digital-media tool, blogs, using a rhetoric-textual analysis method and critical discourse analysis method for the fictional text, Americanah. These methods employ the psychoanalyticalAlthusserian critique of Adichie's fictional narrative, Americanah. In the psychoanalytical sense, blog-writing can qualify as a mechanism of 'sublimation' in the post-modern world. In the Althusserian sense, blogs become persuasive mechanisms for a subject's interpellation into non-dominant ideology. Among the plethora of marginalized global communities, African-Americans are enormously embracing the virtual communication trends for socio-political motives. This paper theorizes the correlations between race-related blogging, psychoanalytic sublimation, and the socio-political repudiation of power structure by employing the literary text as material evidence. Accordingly, the literary study has concluded that digital-mediums (i.e., in this case, political blogs) can depose the power vested in the ideologicalstate-apparatuses and impose a high potential for expression of unrestrained, credible, and democratic voice of the marginalized. It also validates that blogs/blogging influences and moulds national/political/racial discourses by lending a liberated voice and context-independent perspective to the racially oppressed.

T1  - Hegemonic masculinity, gender, and social distance: the mediating role of perceived dangerousness
AN  - 2509921960
AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people’s desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting ‘toxic’ attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression.

T1  - Beliefs on COVID-19 Among Electronic Cigarette Users: Behavioral Responses and Implications for COVID Prevention and E-Cigarette Interventions
AN  - 2498914120
AB  - E-cigarette users’ beliefs about COVID-19 may shape their responses to the pandemic and their e-cigarette consumption. A U.S. national cross-sectional survey of 562 e-cigarette users was conducted in April 2020. Participants self-reported nicotine consumption, COVID-19 beliefs, beliefs about e-cigarettes, social distancing, COVID-19 disruptions, cessation considerations, and individual characteristics. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression provided unstandardized, and standardized coefficients. Frequency of e-cigarette use is inversely associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (β = −0.215). Beliefs e-cigarettes are addictive, harmful, or pose a risk to future health were positively associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (β = 0.171; β = 0.164; β = 0.203), beliefs the media are truthful on COVID-19 (β = 0.133; β = 0.136; β = 0.137), and beliefs e-cigarette users are at greater risk (β = 0.279; β = 0.411; β = 0.447). All three COVID-19 beliefs (COVID relevant; media truthful; and greater risk) were positively associated with social distancing (β = 0.307; β = 0.259; β = 0.115), work disruptions (β = 0.134; β = 0.135; β = 0.130), family disruptions (β = 0.232; β = 0.131; β = 0.164), friendship disruptions (β = 0.214; β = 0.139; β = 0.133), and considerations of quitting (β = 0.250; β = 0.222; β = 0.620). Strong associations between e-cigarette beliefs and COVID-19 beliefs exist. COVID-19 beliefs are associated with behavioral responses, such as social distancing and considerations of e-cigarette cessation. Interventions may be able to leverage COVID-19 beliefs to reduce e-cigarette consumption or promote cessation during the pandemic.

T1  - Self-Perceptions of the Risk of Discrimination and Social Exclusion: Assessing the Six-year Aftermath of the National Strategy for Roma Integration in Bulgaria
AN  - 2492799968
AB  - The research hypothesis of this paper stems from the argument that the Bulgarian authorities and the broader audiences decode Roma integration through the prism of an inequalities-poverty-social exclusion framework, meaning that the growth of ‘being integrated’ is viewed as a gradual decrease of the value of indicators related to social exclusion and a steady rise in indicators of well-being. In elaborating their argument, the authors consult the recent ‘integration literature’ and then theoreticize the Bulgarian NRIS and the change of ‘integration’ vocabulary over time. A representative sociological survey is deployed as an empirical foundation for proving, or disputing, that the effects and consequences of the NRIS can be assessed based on the presented data. The explored data represent the self-assessment of individual exposures to the risk of discrimination and social exclusion in access to healthcare, employment and public services alongside the progress of NRIS. In addition, a baseline from an earlier period is used to visualize the course of social processes.

T1  - Close‐knit ties through thick and thin: Sharing social exclusion and acceptance enhances social bond
AN  - 2509211816
AB  - Three experiments investigated whether and why sharing experiences of social exclusion or social acceptance with others strengthens social bonds. Participants experienced either social exclusion or social acceptance alongside another co‐participant who either also experienced the same outcome, or experienced a different outcome, as them. Multilevel modeling results showed that participant dyads who shared the experience of social exclusion or social acceptance felt closer to each other than those who experienced different outcomes, and that perceived similarity mediated the effect of shared experiences on social bonds. Interestingly, participants felt closer to one another after having shared social acceptance, more so than when they have shared social exclusion. Implications of the present findings are interpreted in light of theories of social exclusion, shared experiences, and social bonding.

T1  - Ethnic Stereotype Formation and Its Impact on Sojourner Adaptation: A Case of “Belt and Road” Chinese Migrant Workers in Montenegro
AN  - 2576412652
AB  - Ethnic stereotypes are cognitive markers that are formed and modified because of intercultural contact with a new cultural group. There is now much empirical evidence that explicates how stereotypes of ethnic groups can impact individuals’ acculturation experiences. However, what is unknown is how previously nonexistent ethnic beliefs are formed as a result of contact with the local culture. One hundred and seventy-four (N = 174) overseas Chinese construction workers were contacted through the Chinese Consulate in Montenegro and agreed to participate in the present study. The online questionnaire asked workers to describe Montenegrin majority members in terms of five characteristics. These traits formed the stereotype markers that were classified as positive, neutral, or negative. Sojourners also answered questions that measured perceived cultural distance, social exclusion, knowledge of Montenegrin culture, feelings of social exclusion, and their sociocultural adaptation. Results show that both positive and negative stereotypes are correlated with less social exclusion and better socio-cultural adaptation. Perceived cultural distance, knowledge of host culture and length of stay was mediated by stereotypes on adaptation outcomes. Interestingly longer sojourn did not lessen the type of stereotype, nor did it reduce cultural distance. Contribution to the stereotype literature and practical understanding of how Chinese sojourners see majority members will be discussed.

T1  - Impact of Income, Deprivation and Social Exclusion on Subjective Poverty: A Structural Equation Model of Multidimensional Poverty in Hong Kong
AN  - 2509630985
AB  - Multidimensional poverty in urban cities has become an increasing global concern. Income poverty, deprivation, social exclusion and subjective poverty have been commonly used as measurements for poverty. However, the path relationship among these various dimensions has been ignored. This study aims to fill this research gap by focusing on the impact on subjective poverty. A random sample survey of 1979 adult participants in Hong Kong was used for the analysis. Structural equation modelling was applied in studying the path relationship among the monetary, material, social and subjective dimensions of poverty. Subjective poverty was predicted through a mediated model, with deprivation and social exclusion as the mediators. The result of this structural equation modelling indicated that the impact of income on subjective poverty was partially mediated by the material and social dimensions of poverty. In an age group comparison analysis, deprivation showed a larger influence on the elderly group, whilst social exclusion had a larger mediating effect on the younger group. The implication of these results and limitations are discussed.

T1  - Social distancing as a critical test of the micro-sociology of solidarity
AN  - 2471475125
AB  - Face-to-face (F2F) embodied interaction is the initial ingredient of interaction ritual (IR), the buildup of shared emotion, mutual focus of attention, and rhythmic entrainment that produces interpersonal solidarity. What happens when a natural experiment (the COVID-19 epidemic) prevents most F2F encounters or limits the modes of micro-interactional communication by masking? The paper examines evidence of the effects of masking and social distancing on public behavior, family life, remote schooling and remote work, prohibition of large audiences and assemblies, and attempts to substitute non-embodied electronic media. Most effects are consistent with IR theory predictions.

T1  - Social exclusion and multi-domain well-being in Chinese migrant children: Exploring the psychosocial mechanisms of need satisfaction and need frustration
AN  - 2451173005
AB  - While it is well established that social exclusion has negative effects on well-being, there have been few thorough investigations into the mediating mechanisms through which social exclusion affects the well-being of children. Combining the social exclusion framework with the self-determination theory, this study aims to examine whether the satisfaction and frustration of psychosocial needs for autonomy, relatedness and competence mediated the relationships between social exclusion and well-being of migrant children. The study drew on a sample of 484 Chinese migrant children (mean age = 11.65, 52.9% girls) residing in Kunming, China. A sequential mediation model was tested using structural equation modeling to validate our hypotheses. The results indicated that a higher level of structural-economic exclusion was associated with a higher level of socio-relational exclusion, which in turn pointed to a negative association with need satisfaction and a positive association with need frustration, thereby explaining lower levels of child well-being. The present study expands current knowledge and deepens our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how social exclusion affects child well-being and sheds light on practical implications for policymakers and social workers to promote the well-being of migrant children in China.

T1  - Television’s undoing of social distancing
AN  - 2431181969
AB  - At this critical moment in time, April 2020, when we are living with the cataclysmic event of Covid-19, television – a medium declared almost dead at the beginning of this millennium – has become a vital resource for solace, daydreaming, social ritual, knowledge and storytelling. In conditions of lockdown, we turn towards television, not away from it (Ellis, 2020; Negra, 2020). We are checking news on national channels, and tuning to live broadcasting for campaigns to help the health services and communities in need, such as with the globally broadcast One World: Together At Home special. We are curling up on the sofa to engage with gripping drama, like Ozark streaming on Netflix, re-watching favourite series from the beginning, such as Buffy or Breaking Bad, and taking part in television quiz shows like Pointless, even watching repeats, to recreate a pub quiz atmosphere in the living room. On a darker note, we are also overloaded with corona news; the ritual evening news bulletin can be a source of anxiety and a cause of sleeplessness. Television infrastructure can break down, from broken satellite dishes to lost remote controls, which are tricky to fix when technicians are not so readily available to help; and television can be an economic burden. The cost of streaming Breaking Bad can push the limits of monthly contracts and data packages. Television both lightens and darkens the mood of domestic spaces and social relations in lockdown culture.

T1  - Shifting Can Be Stressful for African American Women: A Structural Mediation Model
AN  - 2447808516
AB  - The present study was designed to examine shifting, the phenomenon of altering or modifying one’s self-presentation in different social contexts, as a mediator of the predictive effects of African American women’s acculturation on their perceived race-related stress. To explore this issue, measures of African American acculturation, shifting, and race-related stress were examined within a structural model. The current study quantitatively examined the relationships of these variables among a sample of 366 African American women. Results of a structural equation model indicated full mediation; greater levels of immersion in African American acculturation resulted in greater levels of shifting, which, in turn, generated increased levels of race-related stress. These data extend previous work and expand the literature regarding African American women’s shifting. Implications for clinical work and future research with African American women are also discussed.

AB  - COVID-19 is a threat to everyone’s health but can be especially devastating to older individuals. To prevent spread of the virus, social distancing has become the norm worldwide. However, with social distancing comes significantly less face-to-face interaction, which may be particularly harmful to older adults given their existing levels of loneliness. While social technologies can be used to provide critical social interaction during this time of necessary physical distancing, older adults tend to either lack access to these technologies or the skills and experience necessary to use them effectively. Once online, older adults face the additional challenge of being outsized targets of misinformation and scams, both of which abound in the context of COVID-19. In this essay, we discuss the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic, as well as highlight some of the population’s untapped strengths which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. Finally, we provide recommendations for actions which key stakeholders can take to support older adults in this pursuit.

T1  - Raoult, social distancing and the rebelious French ‐ A reflection on COVID‐19 treatments online debates
AN  - 2431010961
AB  - France was in lockdown since 17 March untill 11 May 2020 and, in this measure against the COVID‐19 pandemic that could be the plot for a dystopic bad movie, social life has gone online. However, many in France believe that they have found the solution to the crisis in Didier Raoult from Marseille’s IHU Mediterranée Infection. Raoult, a professor in infectious‐disease studies with a research focus on viruses, claimed in February to have found a cure for COVID‐19. According to him, the chloroquine molecule, used to treat malaria, combined with azithromycin, is able to reduce the virus infection in patients. This reflection is not an examination of the validity of that claim or the validity of Raoult’s research but rather a look at the communication around Raoult on social networks such as Facebook, as these virtual gathering sites have become the new public space.

T1  - Does Rejection Still Hurt? Examining the Effects of Network Attention and Exposure to Online Social Exclusion
AN  - 2353474620
AB  - Social media platforms archive the content and flow of social exchange across communication networks. This may present challenges for individuals because using these platforms increases the probability of observing exchanges among their friends in which they were unintentionally excluded. This study randomly assigned 194 participants to conditions where they were presented with written scenarios describing hypothetical online conversations between their close friends in which they were excluded or included. Results suggest that participants in the excluded condition experienced the most negative and least positive emotional responses. Further, participants with the tendency to devote cognitive resources to understanding their social networks—a construct we call network attention—were particularly sensitive to the stimuli. Network attention predicted negative emotional responses in the excluded condition and positive emotional responses in the included condition. Results are discussed in the context of communication and cognition via social media.

T1  - Exploring U.S. Shifts in Anti-Asian Sentiment with the Emergence of COVID-19
AN  - 2635380834
AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019–June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

AN  - 2395331890
AB  - This paper is aimed to document the observed social exclusion and discrimination in the outbreak of COVID-19 across the world and inside of China. Discrimination and social exclusion has occurred in various forms, while 25.11% of respondents overseas experienced discrimination in the breakout of COVID-19, and 90% of respondents inside of China exhibited discriminatory attitudes. The discrimination and social exclusion also lead to a range of damaging social outcomes. Thus, this is an urgent call for the inclusiveness in policy and media in the face of this public health emergency.

T1  - Campus Racial Incidents, Hate Crimes, and White Male and Female Students’ Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2328370215
AB  - Despite popular claims that the United States has reached a “post-racial” era—one in which race no longer matters for determining one’s life chances—college students continue to have strong views toward whether or not racial discrimination is still a major problem in this country. Utilizing multilevel modeling on data merged from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program’s (CIRP) 2005 Freshman Survey (TFS) and 2009 College Senior Survey (CSS), as well as the Integrated Postsecondary Educational Data System (IPEDS) and the Office of Postsecondary Education Campus Safety and Security database, this study examined individual and institutional predictors of white male and female college students’ senior-year views on whether racial discrimination is still a major problem in the United States, with a particular focus on campus racially biased incidents and hate crimes. Results show that having a reported hate crime on campus did not have a significant association with white students’ senior-year views, while a higher level of news coverage of campus racially biased incidents significantly predicted white women’s senior-year views on racial discrimination. Implications of the findings with respect to higher education research, policy, and practice are discussed.

T1  - Social Support Versus Emotion Regulation: Mediators of Attachment and Psychological Problems After Social Exclusion
AN  - 2331210016
AB  - Introduction: Secure parental attachment improves the perception of available social support and the socialization of emotion regulation strategies. Research has suggested that both perceived social support and emotion regulation help individuals reappraise stressful situations as less stressful. Individuals under stress are at an increased risk for psychological problems. Method: The current study examined whether social support, emotion regulation, and psychological inflexibility mediated the relation between parental attachment and psychological problems after a social exclusion task. Results: Results indicated that secure parental attachment was associated with an increased ability to up-regulate emotions and with an increase in the perception of available social support. Secure attachment to either parent was indirectly associated with psychological problems reported after social exclusion. Discussion: Indirect effects were found only for pathways from attachment through emotion regulation strategies, which suggests that emotion regulation may be a driving factor between attachment to parental figures and stress induced psychological problems. Further results, limitations, and implications were discussed.

T1  - Attitudes Towards and Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) Among Older Adults in Italy and Sweden: the Influence of Cultural Context, Socio-Demographic Factors, and Time Perspective
AN  - 2223139520
AB  - This study examined determinants of attitudes towards and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in older adults, including variations in cultural context, socio-demographic factors (age, education, and gender) and the individual’s time perspective. Towards this end, 638 older adults in Italy (n = 262, M = 71.7 years) and Sweden (n = 376, M = 69.9 years) completed the Swedish Time Perspective Inventory (S-ZTPI), the Attitude toward Technologies Questionnaire (ATTQ), and questions regarding use of specific digital technologies (e.g. Internet, Skype, Facebook); data were collected in 2013–2014. The results showed more positive attitudes toward ICTs in Swedish compared with Italian elderly as well as more frequent use of technologies. Regardless of nationality, younger age and higher levels of educational attainment was positively associated with attitudes towards ICTs. Male gender was associated with higher ATTQ scores in the Italian, but not in the Swedish, sample. Time perspective accounted for significant variance beyond the foregoing variables. S-ZTPI Past Negative, Future Negative and Present Fatalistic in particular, were (negatively) related to ATTQ scores, with a similar pattern for ICT use. Future Positive and Present Hedonistic were positively associated with ATTQ scores, across the samples. In conclusion, between-person differences in time perspective organization are an important factor to account for variability in attitudes towards and use of ICTs in old age, and appears to exert an influence over and beyond other significant predictors, such as cultural context, age/cohort membership, and educational level.

T1  - The Socio-Political Context Behind the Malayan Insurgency, 1948-1960
AN  - 2345784011
AB  - This article examines the socio-political context surrounding the Malayan Insurgency (1948-1960) and how it shaped the outcome of counter-insurgency (COIN) operations in the Malayan peninsular. It will put forward the idea that the success of British COIN in Malaya was primarily due to the structure of Malayan society that was inhospitable towards a communist insurrection by analysing the significance of race relations, religion, culture and the impact of diaspora towards the changing social landscape of Malaya.Alternate abstract:Artikel ini mengkaji konteks sosio-politik semasa Darurat Tanah Melayu (1948-1960) dan bagaimana ia telah menyumbang kepada kejayaan operasi-operasi menentang komunis di Malaya/Semenanjung Malaysia. Esei ini akan mengemukakan idea bahawa kejayaan pihak British dalam memerangi komunis di Tanah Melayu adalah terutamanya disebabkan oleh struktur masyarakat Malaya pada masa itu yang tidak bersekutu dengan ideologi komunis. Untuk menyokong hipotesis ini, analisis akan dibuat ke atas kepentingan hubungan kaum, agama, budaya dan kesan diaspora kepada landskap sosial Malaya.

TT  - Public Attitudes on Energy (In)Security: Evidence from Spain
AN  - 2283307735
AB  - Este estudio investiga cómo perciben los ciudadanos los retos de la seguridad energética, analizando los datos originales de una encuesta realizada en una muestra de cuota de ciudadanos españoles (n=339). Los resultados demuestran que la seguridad energética en general y la asequibilidad de los precios de la electricidad en los hogares en particular son motivo de gran preocupación para los ciudadanos. Los ciudadanos mayores de nuestra muestra parecen estar más preocupados por el acceso equitativo a los servicios energéticos que la población más joven. Los ciudadanos con más educación parecen ser más conscientes de los riesgos de la seguridad energética. La creación de vínculos más estrechos entre el público y los responsables políticos, mediante la sensibilización sobre cuestiones energéticas y el fomento de un debate público en torno a la cuestión de la seguridad energética, podría reducir el desajuste entre las necesidades energéticas de los usuarios de energía y las políticas energéticas y, en última instancia, aliviar los problemas energéticos de los más desfavorecidos.Alternate abstract:This study investigates how citizens perceive energy security challenges, by analysing an original survey data fielded in a quota sample of Spanish citizens (n=339). Findings demonstrate that energy security in general and the affordability of household electricity prices in particular is of extremely high concern for the citizens. Older citizens in our sample seem to be more worried about the equitable access to energy services than the younger population. Citizens with more education seem to be more aware of energy security risks. Creating closer ties between the public and policy makers, by raising awareness on energy matters and fostering a public debate around the issue of energy security could decrease the mismatch between the energy needs of energy-users and the energy policies, and eventually alleviate energy troubles of the most disadvantaged.

T1  - Challenging Geographical Disadvantages and Social Exclusion: A Case Study of Gendered Rural Transformation in Mountain Villages in the Western Black Sea Region of Turkey
AN  - 2257532646
AB  - This article discusses the gender‐specific effect of the changing economic structure of mountain villages in Turkey. Rural women, who are conventionally unpaid family workers, have begun entering into off‐farm work due to declining household incomes in recent years. The implications of this for gender relations are found to be contradictory in much recent research. In this study, we employed the concepts of the hybridity of rural communities and the multiplicity of social exclusion in a globalising countryside. We used a qualitative methodology employing multiple sources of data. In addition to in‐depth interviews with 27 village women, we conducted semi‐structured interviews with village headmen and structured interviews with 218 village women to understand the structural context behind the women’s narratives. We found that the dimension of social exclusion varies with gender and age within the community. While middle‐aged men are increasingly unemployed and have withdrawn into uncompetitive rural life, young women engage in wage work and challenge geographical disadvantages by spending their meagre earnings on transportation and communication technologies. The reconfiguration of marginality within the community, rather than the total marginalisation of villagers, is an ongoing process.

T1  - Stress and positive attitudes towards violent discipline are associated with school violence by Ugandan teachers
AN  - 2256519400
AB  - Background Globally, the use of violent discipline methods by teachers to manage child behavior is still highly prevalent despite enactment of laws that prohibit school violence. In the case of Uganda there is a dearth of accurate prevalence statistics on school violence and factors associated with the use of violence by teachers. Objectives Therefore, the current study examined the prevalence of and attitudes towards violence. The study also explored the association between teachers' stress, positive attitudes towards violence and the use of violent discipline management methods. Methods A representative sample of 291 teachers and 702 students from 12 public secondary schools in southwestern Uganda responded to anonymous self-administered questionnaires. Data were collected from April to November 2017. Results Findings indicated that 86.5% of the teachers reported having used violent disciplinary methods on students in the past month while 91.5% of the students reported experiencing violence by teachers. Teachers (88.3%, n = 256) endorsed positive attitudes towards violent discipline. Teachers' stress was related to higher levels of violent discipline (β = 0.20). This relation was mediated by positive attitudes towards violence (0.06, SE: 0.01, 95%-CI: 0.035–0.092). Conclusions Our findings indicate that teacher reported stress was associated with their use of violent behavior and positive attitudes and that positive attitudes reduced the association between teachers' stress and violent behavior. Therefore, interventions aiming to reduce violence by teachers may need to integrate effective stress management skills, in addition to nonviolent discipline strategies, and fostering attitudinal change towards the use of violent methods.

T1  - Identity Politics: Intentional Divisions for Political Profit
AN  - 2251595283
AB  - This paper reviews the issue of identity politics and the divisiveness of government solutions, rather than human factor improvements in society. The paper begins with a brief recounting of a city of Chicago cold case crime reflective of the injustice perpetrated against African American citizens at the time. The paper compares that environment and time in our nation 's history with more current times in terms of race relations, overall civility and economic opportunity for people of all backgrounds. While the media paints a picture of a very unequal and unjust society, the argument is made that, while still not perfect, the United States of American has made significant strides and continual efforts to offer fairness, justice, and prosperity to all of its citizens. Further, the argument is made that those who perpetuate identity politics ensure division and animosity rather than supporting a unifying goal of equaljustice and abundant of economic opportunity.

T1  - Motivated gratitude and the need to belong: Social exclusion increases gratitude for people low in trait entitlement
AN  - 2162912666
AB  - Three studies examined effects of social exclusion on reactions to receiving an unexpected gift. Trait Psychological Entitlement was also measured as a potential moderator in all studies. In Study 1, participants wrote about a time they felt rejected, accepted, or something neutral. Compared to the control condition, social exclusion increased self-reported gratitude and observer-rated gratitude. These effects were found among people scoring low on narcissistic entitlement. For these participants also, social rejection increased perception of the benefactor’s warmth, and this increase in perceived warmth mediated the increase in gratitude. Study 2 measured trait need to belong (rather than manipulating it via social rejection) and found similar results: participants low in trait entitlement and high in trait need to belong had higher levels of gratitude than those low in trait need to belong. In Study 3 some participants underwent a peer rejection manipulation. Upon receiving a gift, rejected participants low in entitlement were more grateful (according to self and observer ratings) and engaged in more prosocial behavior than nonrejected participants. The main conclusion is that, among people low in entitlement, social rejection stimulates a heightened desire for social connection, which moves them to functionally project warm intentions onto a benefactor, which in turn makes them more grateful.

T1  - Too good to be true: The effect of conciliatory message design on compromising attitudes in intractable conflicts
AN  - 2223753067
AB  - The aim of this article is twofold: first, to demonstrate how the use of experimental methods challenges the implicit assumption of progressive discourse analysts that ‘inspiring’ messages will have a positive effect on political attitudes and trust regardless of the recipients’ early political dispositions, and second, to examine the power of conciliatory message design to change political attitudes in favor of a peaceful solution to intractable conflicts such as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. By employing the conceptual frameworks of progressive discourse analysis and experimental critical discourse analysis, we examined the most comprehensive hypothesis formulated thus far in the literature of conflict resolution with regard to the conditions under which conciliatory messages become successful. We found that the exposure of hawkish participants to highly conciliatory messages decreases both their support for compromise-based peace and their trust in the opponent’s leader, which underlines the need for more caution on the side of peace discourse scholars when assuming that conciliatory language has the power to bring about a (positive) political change. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for critical/progressive discourse analysts, conflict resolution scholars and professionals involved in conciliatory message design.

AB  - Applying selected psychoanalytic constructs from Freud and Klein to recent pervasive rhetoric around anti-immigration in the United States, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of media and policy representations of immigrants in recent news coverage in the United States regarding the Trump Administration’s response to (1) asylum claims related to domestic violence and gang violence and (2) undocumented immigrants. We illustrate how feared bad object/immigrants are constructed alongside the imagined good object/nationalism, as exemplified by Trump’s motto – “Make America Great Again” (MAGA). We argue how this paranoid-schizoid position reifies racism veiled under nationalism and discuss how social workers could work together toward the depressive position re-imagining America-as-the-whole.

T1  - Do the Ladies Run This Mutha? The Relationship between Political Rap and Black Feminist Attitudes
AN  - 2174121234
AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College; a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women.

T1  - Older adults' perceived sense of social exclusion from the digital world
AN  - 2183049600
AB  - A great deal of information and many services can now be accessed digitally. In order to make use of such services, however, it is necessary to have some form of Internet access. A lack of involvement in digital society may produce new forms of social exclusion. Older adults are particularly at risk of Internet-related social exclusion, since they tend to use the Internet less than younger adults. Little is known, however, about whether this lower level of Internet use among older people is in fact accompanied by a sense of social exclusion. In order to investigate the subjective sense of digital social exclusion resulting from a lack of Internet usage, we conducted a secondary analysis of a representative, cross-sectional telephone survey of 1,037 adults aged 65 years and over and living in Switzerland. We found that 33% of "onliners" reported that they would feel socially excluded were they to stop using the Internet, compared with 14% of "onliners" who felt socially excluded on account of their lack of Internet use. Our analyses show that onliners' attitudes toward Internet use and the variety of online applications available were related to their sense of social exclusion. By contrast, offliners' attitudes toward Internet use and their feelings of loneliness in general were predictors for their sense of social exclusion as a result of not using the Internet. The results of the study as well as its implications for research and practice are discussed.

T1  - Social exclusion of life in the written media of the disabilities: the importance of media literacy and education
AN  - 2157776921
AB  - Disability is not only a health problem faced by disabled people and their families; it is necessary to consider it as a situation closely related to social aspects and society. Disability is a social phenomenon that concerns the disabled, the family, the immediate surroundings, and the community to which they belong. Disabled individuals, like every human being, want to share their social surroundings and their experiences of briefly living their emotions, thoughts, dreams. However, even for non-disabled individuals, communication, which can be difficult under certain conditions, can become even more difficult for disabled people. Because the psycho-social structure, values, attitudes, perceptions of life, and thoughts of the individuals in society are different. Therefore, disabled individual who is evaluated as a pitiful and poor person by the influence of prejudices in the social perception process can be exposed to the negative attitudes of the society and be excluded. It is not an “obstacle” on the basis of the “disability” your disability faces; the society that prefers the difference created by the obstacle lies in the “obstructive attitudes” developed against the obstruction. Written media have been shown and proven as the reason for this difference in our work. Our work will be demonstrated by an in-depth interview methodology of approaching the subject of five disabled people with the highest number of disabled people in the TRNC. Negative perceptions of the disability within the society are not only something that the written media can correct, but are also closely connected with the consciousness of the associations’ authorities and their shaping of their strategies accordingly. We tried to emphasize the media importance of literacy and media literacy education in this area. The media literacy training program will reduce the negative representations created by the media and their negative consequences because there will be conscious media consumers. At this point, the social exclusion that the people living in the society in the presence of the media representatives of the disability will be reduced the most.

T1  - Discrimination, segregation, and chronic inflammation: Testing the weathering explanation for the poor health of Black Americans
AN  - 2125723457
AB  - Several studies have reported a relation between race-related stressors and the poor health of Black Americans. Such findings raise questions regarding the mediating biological mechanisms that might account for this link. The present study investigated elevated systemic inflammation, a factor shown to be a strong predictor of chronic illness and mortality in all ethnic populations, as a possible factor. Using 7 waves of data from the Family and Community Health Study, collected over a 20-year period from over 400 Black Americans, we investigated the extent to which exposure to discrimination and segregation at various points in the life course predicted adult inflammation at age 28. Our analyses examined whether cumulative stress, stress generation, or predictive adaptive response (PAR) models best accounted for any associations that existed between these race-related stressors and adult inflammation. At every wave of data collection, assessments of discrimination and segregation were related to adult inflammation. However, multivariate analyses using structure equation modeling indicated that the PAR model best explained the effect of these race-related stressors on inflammation. Exposure to discrimination and segregation during the juvenile years predicted adult inflammation and amplified the inflammatory effect of adult exposure to these race-related stressors. These effects were considerably more robust than that of traditional health risk factors such as diet, exercise, smoking, and low SES. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the limitations of the widely accepted risk factor approach to increasing the health of Black Americans.

T1  - Spanish youth is emigrating: A bibliometric approach to the media coverage
AN  - 2062795914
AB  - Recent years have witnessed the emigration of young Spanish people searching for labor opportunities. A decade after the beginning of the worldwide economic crisis in 2007, the rapid deterioration of living conditions and lack of opportunities for personal development combined with the breakdown of professional expectations have led thousands of young people to emigrate from Spain, creating the so-called youth exodus. The press has paid recurrent attention to this phenomenon, often using eye-catching headlines such as ‘Brain Drain’. Given the regular interest of the media in this phenomenon, the objective of this research is to analyze the media coverage of the drain of Spanish talent capital, or the emigration of young Spanish people seeking a better future, to create a distributive map that defines the characteristics and trends of this coverage. The analyzed corpus comprises 346 articles from eight Spanish and eleven international newspapers. The articles were coded based on descriptive variables (i.e., author, publication year, newspaper and language) and categorical variables (i.e., section, method, approach to the phenomenon, assessment of the phenomenon and overview of the phenomenon). The results indicate a significant increase in press coverage over the past few years and reveal associations between assessment of the phenomenon and year and between assessment of the phenomenon and section. As a result of this research, new investigative lines are unveiled regarding the social construction of the phenomenon in the media and the identity and individual construction of the ‘truncated careers’ of young Spanish people.

T1  - Social exclusion in families affected by paternal imprisonment
AN  - 2044019553
AB  - Although social exclusion is often described as an outcome of paternal imprisonment, few studies have directly measured the extent of social exclusion in prisoners’ families or benchmarked it against the general population. This paper compares social exclusion among caregivers of children affected by paternal incarceration with overall estimates of social exclusion across the Australian population and with estimates of social exclusion among a matched subset. Caregivers of children with imprisoned fathers were much more heavily excluded than adults in the general population. Compared to a matched sample, differences were smaller and mostly related to inadequate financial resources. We propose that single parent status and financial hardship are key mediators of the relationship between paternal incarceration and social exclusion.

T1  - Recent Police Killings in the United States: A Three-City Comparison
AN  - 2036720482
AB  - Recent police killings of citizens in the United States have attracted massive coverage in the media, large-scale public protests, and demands for reform of police departments throughout the country. This study is based on a content analysis of newspaper coverage of recent high-profile incidents that resulted in a citizen’s death in Ferguson, North Charleston, and Baltimore. We identify both incident-specific content as well as more general patterns that transcend the three cases. News media coverage of similar incidents in past decades tended to be episodic and favored the police perspective. Our findings point to some important departures from this paradigm. Reporting in our three cases was more likely to draw connections between discrete incidents, to attach blame to the police, and to raise questions about the systemic causes of police misconduct. These findings may be corroborated in future studies of news media representations of high-profile policing incidents elsewhere.

T1  - Social Exclusion, Social Support and Psychological Wellbeing at School: A Study of Mediation and Moderation Effect
AN  - 2034652378
AB  - Social exclusion experiences thwart fundamental human needs, and threaten youths’ mental health and wellbeing. Given the literature supporting the protective effect of social support, the present study investigated whether social support mediated and moderated the relation between social exclusion and psychological wellbeing at school. Sample consisted of 407 adolescents (49.9% of female) with ranging in age between 11 and 18 years (M = 13.94, SD = 1.64). Findings of the structural equation modeling analyses indicated that social support sources–family, peer and school– had mediating effect on the relationship of social exclusion and youths’ psychological wellbeing. Additionally, regression analyses showed that social support had also a moderator role on this association. However, the role of these resources (family, school and peer support) varied with regard to gender, and herein the effect of social support was greater in female students. Moreover, school support moderated the association of social exclusion and female students’ psychological wellbeing, while peer support had a moderator role on this relation for male students. In sum, the study results support that youths who perceive themselves as being socially excluded at school have lower social support and psychological wellbeing, and the importance of social support resources on youths’ psychological wellbeing in adolescents. Implications for future research and practice are discussed, and several suggestions are presented.

T1  - Do Hostile School Environments Promote Social Deviance by Shaping Neural Responses to Social Exclusion?
AN  - 2296042843
AB  - The present study examined adolescents’ neural responses to social exclusion as a mediator of past exposure to a hostile school environment (HSE) and later social deviance, and whether family connectedness buffered these associations. Participants (166 Mexican‐origin adolescents, 54.4% female) reported on their HSE exposure and family connectedness across Grades 9–11. Six months later, neural responses to social exclusion were measured. Finally, social deviance was self‐reported in Grades 9 and 12. The HSE–social deviance link was mediated by greater reactivity to social deviance in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region from the social pain network also implicated in social susceptibility. However, youths with stronger family bonds were protected from this neurobiologically mediated path. These findings suggest a complex interplay of risk and protective factors that impact adolescent behavior through the brain.

T1  - Resistance: Active and Creative Political Protest Strategies: PROD
AN  - 2036622816
AB  - Resistance to U.S. President Donald Trump’s policies on gender equality, health care, race relations, the environment, and immigration has been large, widespread, and persistent. Following President Trump’s election, millions of people across the United States protested, creatively using slogans, signs, costumes, chants, and songs. Others engaged in resistance with online videos, songs, memes, and hashtags. By employing the communicative informatics model, we examine the relationship between online communication and the creative and active audience involved in U.S. political resistance in 2017.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to analyze the relationships between child-to-parent violence and parental socialization styles with the problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia and attitude towards institutional authority in adolescents. A sample of 2,399 adolescents (50.2% boys and 49.8% girls) enrolled in schools in Andalusia, aged between 12 and 18 years (M = 14.63, SD = 1.91) participated in the study. A MANOVA 4 × 2 × 2 was carried out. The results showed that high child-to-parent violence was related to high levels of problematic use of social networking sites, alexithymia, and a more positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. It was also found that adolescents from families with an indulgent style showed the lowest scores in problematic use of social networking sites,  alexithymia, and positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms. Additionally, in situations of high child-to-parent violence, girls had higher scores in problematic use of social networking sites and alexithymia than boys. Finally, the results and their practical implications are discussed.Alternate abstract:

Se realizó un MANOVA 4 × 2 × 2. Los resultados  mostraron que la alta violencia filioparental se relacionaba con altos niveles de uso problemático de las redes sociales virtuales, de alexitimia y con una actitud más positiva hacia la transgresión de normas sociales. También se constató que los adolescentes procedentes de familias con un estilo indulgente mostraron las menores puntuaciones en uso problemático de las redes sociales virtuales, alexitimia y actitud positiva hacia la transgresión de normas sociales. Además, en situaciones de alta violencia filioparental, las chicas presentaron mayores puntuaciones en uso problemático de las redes sociales virtuales y de alexitimia que los chicos. Finalmente se discuten los resultados y sus implicaciones prácticas.

T1  - “It could turn ugly”: Selective disclosure of attitudes in political discussion networks
AN  - 2002005863
AB  - This article documents individuals selectively disclosing their political attitudes and discusses the consequences of these communication patterns for social influence and the democratic process. Using a large, diverse sample of U.S. resident adults, we ask under which conditions do people reveal their political preferences versus keeping them close to the vest. We find Americans are more likely to share their opinions with friends and family rather than co-workers and they are more likely to share their opinions on more salient topics. More importantly, they withhold their political attitudes specifically from those with whom they disagree in an attempt to avoid conflict. This produces the experience of highly homogeneous social contexts, in which only liberal or conservative views are voiced, while dissent remains silent, and oftentimes goes unacknowledged. This experience is not the result of homogeneous social contexts but the appearance of them. Paradoxically, the mechanism of selective disclosure, whose goal is to prevent conflict at the micro-level, might lead to the perception of greater division in the larger society.

T1  - Positioning young refugees in Australia: media discourse and social exclusion
AN  - 1952104036
AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multi-dimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

T1  - The Sources of the Communication Gap
AN  - 2678107756
AB  - Face-to-face communication drastically increases cooperation rates in social dilemmas. We test which factors are the most important drivers of this communication gap. We distinguish three main categories. First, communication may decrease social distance. Second, communication may enable subjects to assess their opponent's cooperativeness ("type detection") and condition their own action on that information. Third, communication allows subjects to make promises, which create commitment for subjects who do not want to break a promise. We find that communication increases cooperation very substantially. In our experiment, we find that commitment value is an important factor, but the largest part of the increase can be attributed to type detection. We do not find evidence that social distance plays a role.

T1  - Racism: Origin and Theory
AN  - 1925331058
AB  - This is a review of the theoretical development of the concept of racism. From its 1960s activist roots, the concept lost its theoretical content in its 1970s popularization. Now racism describes virtually anything having to do with racial conflict. The concept is reintroduced and used to analyze the post-1970s race relations propositions. The declining significance of race, symbolic racism, color-blind racism, and unconscious racism missed the structural regressions brought on by the "southern strategy" to mask indirect and covert ways to continue racial oppression. As a result, the new Jim Crow was missed in race relations since the 1980s. A reconsideration of the theory of racism calls for a strategic approach to race relations research. Research should focus on the etiology of racism among European Americans and the central role played by White elites and the media in maintaining historic cultural and institutional arrangements.

T1  - The Fear Factor is a Main Thing: How Radio Influences Anxiety and Political Attitudes
AN  - 1923803833
AB  - We investigate how being exposed to media influences levels of anxiety and political attitudes in conflict-affected areas. Exploiting exogenous variation in signal strength of a radio station in South Sudan's Western Equatoria State, we compare original qualitative and quantitative data from areas with differing radio coverage. Civilians living in areas with more exposure to radio are more afraid of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). This anxiety means civilians rely more on a civilian militia, the arrow boys, and less on the state army. Hence media, through fear, can contribute to changing social and political structures.

TT  - Die originäre Rolle qualitativer Forschung für die Untersuchung der Dynamik von Geburtenregistrierung und sozialer Exklusion/Inklusion bei der Umsetzung von Kinderrechten
AN  - 2539302381
AB  - Von NGOs geführte Koalitionen in Zimbabwe engagieren sich für eine deutliche Verbesserung der kontinuierlich defizitären Geburtenregistrierung. Neben dem Insistieren auf dem in internationalen Konventionen zugesicherten Recht wird hierzu eine kausale Beziehung zwischen Geburtenregistrierung einerseits und sozialer Exklusion bzw. Inklusion andererseits betont. Die Idee, eine fehlende Registrierung intensiviere soziale Exklusion ist zu einer Art Mantra der Aktivist/innen geworden, ihr fehlt aber eine empirische Fundierung: Trotz Surveys, die in Zimbabwe und anderen Entwicklungsländern erhoben werden, fehlen Erhebungen, die das dynamische Zusammenspiel von Geburtenregistrierung und Exklusion/Inklusion nachzuvollziehen erlauben würden. In diesem Beitrag versuche ich zu zeigen, in welcher Weise qualitative Sozialforschung helfen kann, diese Lücke zu schließen und die Aktivitäten in Richtung einer umfassenden Geburtenregistrierung zu stützen.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1701104Alternate abstract:In response to the persistent problem of deficient birth registration, NGO-led coalitions in Zimbabwe are seeking to build a strong case for prioritizing universal birth registration. Beside efforts to amplify children's right to birth registration as defined in international rights conventions, these coalitions seek to construct a causal relationship between birth registration and social exclusion outcomes. The idea that the absence of birth registration intensifies social exclusion for children has become something of a mantra in birth registration activism, but despite the surveys conducted in Zimbabwe and other developing countries, data to demonstrate the dynamic interplay of birth registration and social exclusion are lacking. In this article I illustrate that qualitative research can bridge this gap and strengthen birth registration activism.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1701104

T1  - Nostalgia narratives? Pejorative attitudes to welfare in historical perspective: survey evidence from Beveridge to the British Social Attitudes Survey
AN  - 1948390178
AB  - Jensen and Tyler (2015) have powerfully argued that 'anti-welfare commonsense', fuelled by negative political and media discourse stressing welfare dependency and deception, has buttressed support for social security reform in recent years. Along with many other academics they point to the hardening of public attitudes towards welfare state provision and how notions of the 'deserving' and 'undeserving poor' have been reintroduced into popular debates. We identify four distinct threads within this scholarship. First, there is an argument that public attitudes have shifted from an earlier post-war welfare imaginary and settlement to an anti-welfare consensus. Second, this hardening includes a growing prevalence of 'othering'. The third thread is the broadening of this moral and disciplinary gaze to include groups, such as disabled people, who until recently were not subject to the same amount of stigma as other types of benefit recipients. Fourth, is the impact of pejorative welfare discourses on the self-identity and attitudes of disadvantaged groups. 
While a growing body of evidence makes it increasingly difficult to argue against suggestions that there is a hostile body of anti-welfare sentiment in the UK, what is often implicit in the analysis of pejorative contemporary attitudes to welfare is the view that there was once a 'golden age' of the welfare state when public support was more fully behind a strong set of social security benefits provided as a social right of citizenship. Whether this was the case is a moot point however. 
Few studies have tried to piece together the attitudes to welfare of the general public during the consensus era. We attempt to undertake such a task here, drawing on ad hoc attitudes surveys and polling data in particular. Specifically, we focus on how notions of the 'deserving' and 'undeserving poor' play out in this data, pointing to some key continuities found in contemporary and historical public attitudes to welfare.

T1  - It's either you or me! Impact of deviations on social exclusion and leaving: GPIR
AN  - 1853502256
AB  - When detecting deviations from group norms, observers often respond by attempting to exclude the deviates or by leaving the group. Despite the commonalities between these two impactful responses, they have rarely been addressed simultaneously. Therefore, three experiments investigated how deviant behavior in small groups relates to observers' intentions to exclude the deviate from the in-group and to leave that group themselves. Exclusion intentions are evoked by severe deviations from core elements of the group norm, mediated by heightened identity subversion (Studies 1-3). Study 3 demonstrated that leaving becomes more likely when perceived situational control is low--here evoked by acceptance of the deviant behavior by other in-group members, suggesting that aggravating conditions must be present for this response. Observing deviations seems to trigger leaving and exclusion intentions, yet they result from two distinct processes. We discuss our results in relation to work on group schism and literature on social exclusion.

T1  - A Survey of Social Exclusion, Media Portrayal, and Services for Christians Minorities in Pakistan
AN  - 2099267719
AB  - Social exclusion of religious minorities affects them in a number of ways. The main purpose of the present research is to explore the social recognition, freedom of religious practices, feeling of isolation and insecurity amongst minorities in Pakistan. A survey was conducted on 250 sampled respondents through proportionate random sampling technique. An interview schedule was prepared by the researchers contacting different parts to collect data from the respondents. The results indicate that respondents are facing problems regarding their social recognition, freedom of religious practices and as well as feeling of isolation and insecurity. On another side media is highlighting the issues as well. The present study suggest that there should be comprehensive plan of action/ awareness campaign regarding the promotion of spirits of interfaith harmony and dialogues among different segments of society including all minorities.

T1  - The Effects of Information on Public Attitudes Toward Renewable Energy
AN  - 1795683287
AB  - The information-deficit model is a common framework for explaining public attitudes toward new technologies, including renewable energy technology. This model assumes that public opposition to technology is based on a lack of quality information. The siting of facilities, such as commercial wind farms, frequently face opposition from residents of local communities, despite broad public support for renewable energy. Although social science has been critical of the information-deficit model, providing information to the public can influence both the substance and quality of attitudes. In this study, residents of coastal communities in Michigan, supportive of wind energy on average, were provided in-depth information about wind energy. Compared with a control group, participants who attended information sessions exhibited greater change in both their general support for wind energy and the strength of those attitudes. Possible implications for the siting of wind farms and other renewable projects are discussed. [web URL: http://eab.sagepub.com/content/48/6/743.abstract]

T1  - (B)Locked sites: cases of Internet use in three British prisons
AN  - 1774840829
AB  - Based on a qualitative scoping exercise in three British prisons, this article discusses digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that digital media in prisons offers for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. As they are currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, physically cut off from their communities, and unable to communicate with family and friends in ways that have become normal in society, we argue that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. Our results show that prisoners display high levels of both curiosity and enthusiasm as well as fear and reservation toward Internet-enabled technologies, depending on age and gender as well as the length of their sentence. On release from prison, they are not only faced with prejudice and poorer job prospects than the average citizen due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during incarceration may have compound effects and lead to supercharged digital and social exclusion. We argue that secure access would be highly beneficial to prisoners who pose a low risk to society, especially during the rehabilitation and release phases.

T1  - Emotion in obesity discourse: understanding public attitudes towards regulations for obesity prevention
AN  - 1787933219
AB  - Intense concern about obesity in the public imagination and in political, academic and media discourses has catalysed advocacy efforts to implement regulatory measures to reduce the occurrence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. This article explores public attitudes towards the possible implementation of regulations to address obesity by analysing emotions within popular discourses. Drawing on reader comments attached to obesity-relevant news articles published on Australian news and current affairs websites, we examine how popular anxieties about the 'obesity crisis' and vitriol directed at obese individuals circulate alongside understandings of the appropriate role of government to legitimise regulatory reform to address obesity. Employing Ahmed's theorisation of 'affective economies' and broader literature on emotional cultures, we argue that obesity regulations achieve popular support within affective economies oriented to neoliberal and individualist constructions of obesity. These economies preclude constructions of obesity as a structural problem in popular discourse; instead positioning anti-obesity regulations as a government-endorsed vehicle for discrimination directed at obese people. Findings implicate a new set of ethical challenges for those championing regulatory reform for obesity prevention.

T1  - Portrayal of Muslims Following the Murders of Lee Rigby in Woolwich and Mohammed Saleem in Birmingham: A Content Analysis of UK Newspapers
AN  - 1780548311
AB  - In 2013, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale murdered a British soldier, named Lee Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London. In the aftermath of the incident, evidence showed Muslims had become targets for a rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes.1 Most notably, mosques had been reported to have been burnt down and graffiti with messages of hate scrawled against the walls. In such times, the role of the media is crucial in projecting a balanced approach. This study analysed newspaper coverage three weeks from the Woolwich attacks and examined the language and headlines used to describe Muslims. Over 1022 articles from UK newspapers were reviewed using the Nexis database utilising both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the media narrative regarding Muslims and also make a comparative analysis of how the media reported on the case of Mohammed Saleem who was murdered by the far right extremist, Pavlo Lapshyn. The newspaper articles were analysed by using the computer software NVivo to search for and identify patterns across the articles in order to give an idea of the most frequent ways that Muslims were being portrayed. This paper found that news coverage had generalised about Muslims which was made in an overtly prejudicial way.

T1  - Reduced Personal Space in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder
AN  - 1760838789
AB  - Maintaining an appropriate distance from others is important for establishing effective communication and good interpersonal relations. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder associated with social difficulties, and it is thus worth examining whether individuals with ASD maintain typical or atypical degrees of social distance. Any atypicality of social distancing may impact daily social interactions. We measured the preferred distances when individuals with ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals approached other people (a male experimenter) and objects (a coat rack with clothes) or when other people approached them. Individuals with ASD showed reduced interpersonal distances compared to TD individuals. The same tendency was found when participants judged their preferred distance from objects. In addition, when being approached by other people, both individuals with ASD and TD individuals maintained larger interpersonal distances when there was eye contact, compared to no eye contact. These results suggest that individuals with ASD have a relatively small personal space, and that this atypicality exists not only for persons but also for objects.

T1  - Identity and belonging: Saudi female international students and their use of social networking sites
AN  - 1661535605
AB  - This article explores the ways in which Saudi female international students (SFIS) in Australia use social networking sites (SNS) to help them form social networks and present their online identity. Based on themes derived from five in-depth interviews, findings suggest that SFIS use SNS in a way that helps them foster a sense of belonging and connectivity regardless of their location. Currently SFIS use Facebook mainly to keep in touch with friends and family that are both local and international; gain knowledge of the various social and political events happening around them; and have 'fun'. Similar to findings in the literature on social media use by students, SFIS form distinct virtual social networks made up not only of their conational Saudi friends, but also international Saudi as well as Australian and international friends whom they have face to face contact within Australia. As their main purpose of using SNS was to keep in touch with friends, SFIS reported using their real and accurate identity to make it easy for friends to find them. However, when it comes to the online sharing of personal photos SFIS showed a negative attitude towards posting their personal photos due to cultural considerations. Overall, findings of the study align with the literature in which SNS such as Facebook are instrumental for SFIS in maintaining a strong sense of connectivity and bonding while they are temporarily out of their home country.

T1  - MONEY OR ATTENTION? SEX DIFFERENCES IN REACTIONS TO SOCIAL EXCLUSION
AN  - 1767328951; 201605760
AB  - We examined differences in the ways in which men and women perceive and react to social exclusion. Men typically experience agentic-type threats in a social exclusion context and are motivated to improve their agentic belief in themselves, whereas women experience communal-type threats and pay greater attention to others. In this study, we employed the pursuit of money as an agentic form of compensation and pursuit of attention as a communal form of compensation. In 2 experiments with high school students as participants (N = 103 and 126, respectively), we found that social exclusion increases the preference of men for a high salary and the preference of women for conspicuous products, and that self-focus mediates these effects. We have contributed to the literature by exploring the different coping strategies of men and women who face social exclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Analyzing the impact of social media on consumer attitudes toward the brand and their intention to purchase
AN  - 1767326756; 201607434
AB  - Information sources of customers have a significant influence on their attitude and behavioral intentions. Social media is now one of the most important information sources of customers. The purpose of current study is to investigate the impact of social media on customers' attitude towards brand and their intention to purchase. The target population for this research included the customers of Iran-Khodro Company in the area of Tehran. Using a self-administrated questionnaire and employing convenience-sampling method, 210 respondents were asked to fill out the survey questionnaire. Some of the findings indicate that the traditional advertising strategy on behalf of a company accompanied by advertising activities in social media influences customers' positive attitude formation toward Iran-Khodro Company. In conclusion, we can claim that considering the influence of social media on customers' attitudes toward brand is higher than the company's traditional advertisements, it seems reasonable to argue that employing social media for advertising is strategically an advantage for marketers. This is especially true when one considers the fact that it requires less capital compared to traditional tools of marketing such as Television. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Modernization Instigates Social Change: Laptop Usage as a Driver of Cultural Value Change and Gender Equality in a Developing Country
AN  - 1718065578; 201530868
AB  - This research examines how technology usage can instigate social change in a developing country. We expected that technology usage leads to changes in modern cultural values and attitudes toward gender equality while traditional values persist. This was tested in an information and communication technology (ICT) for Development Aid project among Ethiopian children who had received a laptop. A longitudinal field experiment compared children who received a laptop (n = 573) with a matched control group without a laptop (n = 485). Measures were taken before laptop introduction and 6 months later. Laptops had medium to strong effects on value and attitude change, particularly in rural areas. Children with laptops endorsed modern values more strongly, but traditional values were bolstered as well. Modern value change mediated the effect of laptop usage on the endorsement of gender equality. Theoretical and practical implications for cultural changes related to gender equality are discussed.

T1  - Imagined contact as a prejudice-reduction intervention in schools: the underlying role of similarity and attitudes
AN  - 1552385833
AB  - The present research tested a prejudice-reduction intervention based on imagined contact. White children imagined interacting with a child from an ethnic out-group (Asian) once a week for 3 weeks, or did not take part in this activity (control group). Compared with the control group, children who engaged in imagined contact subsequently showed more positive attitudes, greater perceived similarity, and willingness for intergroup contact. The effect of the intervention on willingness for contact was mediated by positive attitude change. Implications for imagined-contact theory and the development of prejudice-reduction techniques for schools are discussed.

T1  - Bolstering system-justifying beliefs in response to social exclusion
AN  - 1700674068; 201524894
AB  - Integrating research on social exclusion with the broader literature on system justification and flexible responses to threats, we propose a novel coping strategy that individuals may use in the face of social exclusion. In particular, we suggest that because exclusion often feels unexpected, it will lead individuals to bolster the system-justifying worldview that people get what they deserve, as excluded individuals attempt to cognitively cope with the threatened order and predictability of their world. Supporting our prediction, in Study 1, social exclusion (vs. inclusion) led participants to increasingly endorse descriptive meritocratic beliefs suggesting that hard work leads to success in society. This effect was mediated by the perceived unexpectedness of the interaction outcome, providing key evidence for our hypothesized process. Study 2 used individual differences in rejection sensitivity to provide further support for our unexpectedness account, demonstrating that exclusion heightens meritocratic beliefs only insofar as participants tend to find exclusions unexpected. The results expand our understanding of the cognitive mechanisms by which people cope with social exclusion and highlight the malleability of system-justifying ideologies in response to interpersonal factors.

T1  - Responses to social exclusion in cultural context: Evidence from farming and herding communities
AN  - 1542001187; 201426960
AB  - In a series of studies, we investigated the role of economic structures (farming vs. herding) and source of ostracism (close other vs. stranger) in social exclusion experiences. We first confirmed that herders rely on strangers to a greater extent than do farmers for economic success (validation study). Next, we verified that farmers and herders understand the concept of ostracism, and its emotional consequences, in similar ways (Study 1). The studies that followed provided converging evidence that cultural group membership shapes sensitivity and responses to social exclusion. Using different methodologies, in Studies 2 and 3, we showed that, whereas the psychological consequences of ostracism by close others are similar for farmers and herders, herders are more strongly affected by ostracism from strangers. The last two studies demonstrated that herders recommend more affiliative responses to ostracism by strangers than do farmers both to those involved in the ostracism event (Study 4) and to naive individuals (Study 5). Moreover, Study 5 revealed that the amount of time spent with strangers mediated cultural group differences in the extent to which affiliative and aggressive actions are recommended following social exclusion by strangers. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the economic systems on which communities are based shape how their members interact with others and that this, in turn, can shape individuals' responses to social exclusion.

T1  - Parents' of adolescents use of social networking sites
AN  - 1641424090; 201501212
AB  - The use of social networking sites (SNSs) has increased exponentially, especially among adolescents. While parents use SNS more than the general population of adults, very little is known about parents' of adolescents behaviors in a social networking environment. Guided by a uses and gratification perspective, the purpose of this study was to examine parents' of adolescents (N = 649) use of SNSs to monitor and connect with their children's life. Analyses revealed that parents of adolescents used SNSs for parenting more often than other online social activities such as instant messaging, Skype, chat rooms, or blogging. The top two reasons for using SNSs were to communicate with children and extended family. Hierarchical logistic regression results indicated that parents of adolescents who used a greater number of SNS activities were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children, their children's friends, and the parents of their children's friends. Those parents who had positive attitudes toward technology were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children's friends but less likely to communicate with parents of their children's friends. Parents of older adolescents were more likely to use SNSs to communicate with their children. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Funny, Ha-Ha: The Impact of User-Generated Political Satire on Political Attitudes: PROD
AN  - 1459460656
AB  - The 2012 election season provided increased opportunities for the collaboration among citizens, new media, and democracy. The "social media election" saw a rise in online user-generated political content posted to YouTube. These videos, often satirical in nature, were viewed by millions, making the potential impacts from this new form of political communication deserving of inquiry. Using experimental design, this study explored the relationship between user-generated political satire and "normative" political attitudes. The results revealed that viewing satirical representations of political candidates did not affect individuals' level of political cynicism or political information efficacy; however, perceptions of candidate credibility and favorability were altered.

T1  - For Us Only? Examining the Effect of Viewing Context on Black Audiences' Perceived Influence of Black Entertainment
AN  - 1445186338
AB  - A host of theories including symbolic interactionism explains how media construct our social perceptions. Research suggests that stereotypes of blacks reinforce negative racial attitudes, whereas other findings suggest that blacks enjoy black media characters, even ones that may be considered stereotypical. Current research has yet to address or explain this discrepancy. The present study explores the impact of the race of co-viewers on blacks' responses to stereotypical content in black films. An experiment was conducted where black participants viewed clips of black films with either an All black audience or a racially mixed group with a majority white audience. Findings revealed that watching black films with white co-viewers did not influence blacks' enjoyment or perception of bias; however, an interaction between viewing condition and influence target emerged such that when viewing among a racially mixed audience, blacks expressed concern that portrayals in the film would negatively influence whites' attitudes toward blacks and their likelihood to interact with black people more than themselves. Implications for race relations in a multicultural media landscape are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Influence of value predispositions, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure on public attitudes toward homosexuals in Singapore
AN  - 1494300205; 201401873
AB  - This national survey tracks changes in Singaporeans' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (ATLG) and examines value predispositions, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure as predictors of ATLG and acceptance of homosexuals. The study replicates and extends research done previously and addresses temporal shifts in values and views. Findings indicate that the relatively small positive change in ATLG from 2005 to 2010 was mainly due to values and demographic factors. The addition of several new predictive variables increased the variance explained for why people hold certain ATLG and their acceptance. Conformity to norms, intrinsic religiosity, Western orientation, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure were significantly associated with both ATLG and acceptance of homosexuals. Perception of homosexuality as a choice was significantly associated with ATLG but not with acceptance of homosexuals. Asian orientation and extrinsic religiosity showed no significant association with either dependent variable. The findings are discussed in the context of a multicultural Asian society and future directions for research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Social Distance Theory of Power
AN  - 1322096408
AB  - We propose that asymmetric dependence between individuals (i.e., power) produces asymmetric social distance, with high-power individuals feeling more distant than low-power individuals. From this insight, we articulate predictions about how power affects (a) social comparison, (b) susceptibility to influence, (c) mental state inference and responsiveness, and (d) emotions. We then explain how high-power individuals' greater experienced social distance leads them to engage in more abstract mental representation. This mediating process of construal level generates predictions about how power affects (a) goal selection and pursuit, (b) attention to desirability and feasibility concerns, (c) subjective certainty, (d) value-behavior correspondence, (e) self-control, and (f) person perception. We also reassess the approach/inhibition theory of power, noting limitations both in what it can predict and in the evidence directly supporting its proposed mechanisms. Finally, we discuss moderators and methodological recommendations for the study of power from a social distance perspective. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gendered Labour Migrations in Europe and Emblematic Migratory Figures
AN  - 2076972709
AB  - This paper explores the dichotomies and gendered invisibilities underpinning the concept of the knowledge economy and society through a closer examination of two emblematic and contrasting figures working in Information and Communication Technology and domestic/care work as bearers of different configurations of knowledge and skills in the contemporary circuits of globalisation. Such knowledge can be broken down into different types-such as embrained, encoded, embodied and encultured-which are valued differentially and with consequences for gendered labour markets. These gendered differences are reflected in current immigration policies which privilege migrants in scientific and information technology sectors and discount those engaged in care work, associated with embodied knowledge and skills. The impact of these differences has been reinforced during a period of economic recession when immigration has become increasingly restricted, even amongst the skilled.

T1  - PARTICIPATORY SPATIAL KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT TOOLS
AN  - 1373428323; 201329467
AB  - Different types of spatial knowledge (expert, sectoral, tacit and community) are strategic resources in urban planning and management. Participatory spatial knowledge management is a major method for eliciting various types of knowledge, providing a platform for knowledge integration and informing local action and public policy. Knowledge types linked to a specific geographical locality can be integrated through geographical information systems. Recent developments in geographical information and communication technology (geoICT) have extended the opportunities for participatory spatial knowledge production, use and exchange. However, data reliability of user-generated content, social exclusion due to dependence on technology and the interpretation and implications of digital maps are major concerns. The challenge is how to integrate and utilize multiple knowledge sources for improving urban management and governance. This paper integrates the literature on knowledge types and knowledge production processes with available geoICT tools for the production, use and exchange of knowledge sources and applies it to examples from Asia, Africa and Latin America. From this review, we provide a heuristic framework for assessing the extent to which participatory spatial knowledge management tools can be instrumental on several fronts. We argue that technological developments of knowledge production have not fully addressed important issues related to accountability, empowerment, control and use of knowledge. Moreover, these developments may foster social exclusion, which could detract from the benefits of participatory spatial knowledge management in the context of urban sustainability.

T1  - Literacy inequalities, mediation and the public good: a case study of physical proximity and social distance in Nepal
AN  - 1364702973; 201325710
AB  - Literacy is considered to be a public good -- one that benefits not only literate people, but also others in society through mechanisms of sharing and mediation. But to what extent do the benefits of literacy extend to socially distant groups? This paper applies the sociological concept of social distance to examine how social stratification impacts on the way that literacy is distributed and 'shared' through mediated practice within and across caste-based groups. The paper presents a case study of physical proximity and social distance in Nepal to examine how literacy is shared in a context where inequalities of literacy and schooling are heavily influenced by gender and caste membership. The findings demonstrate that mediation takes place across caste groups, but less extensively than within caste groups. We conclude that assumptions about how literacy operates as a public good need to be tempered by consideration of the implications of social distance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social distance portrayed: television news in Japan and the UK
AN  - 1429640125; 201336729
AB  - The potential of the camera framing, or shot-size, semiotic resource to encode meanings related to social distance has been recognized for some time. This study seeks to bring this resource into the remit of systematic analysis. Data are taken from screen measurements of portrayals of social actors in news programming produced by two national broadcasters, NHK in Japan and the BBC in the UK. Results for these two media outlets are compared and an attempt made to place the results in a meaningful cultural context. Analysis focuses on NHK's images and the less familiar Japanese media system. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Ukrainianization, terror and famine: coverage in Lviv's Dilo and the nationalist press of the 1930s
AN  - 1283642873; 201304894
AB  - This article looks at the press coverage of Ukrainianization, the Soviet terror, and the famine (Holodomor), particularly in the years 1932-33, focusing on the largest Ukrainian daily outside Soviet Ukraine, the Lviv Dilo. It compares this coverage to the reporting in the press of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). It argues that these two years were a turning point in political attitudes. Galician Ukrainians turned away from the Communist Party of Ukraine and support for the OUN began to grow. Ironically, the OUN had not led protests against the famine, but benefited from the lack of a strong response from European governments and international bodies. The article draws on a reading of the Ukrainian press of the 1930s, and on recent research by Polish and Ukrainian scholars. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The role of usability on stimulating SME's on line buying intention: an experiment based on a ficticius web site design
AN  - 904238110
AB  - The focus of the present paper was to identify the key role of usability in SME's Website design. A conceptual model has been proposed to show how buying intention antecedents are reinforced in highly usable contexts. The model is founded on the relationships between usability, perceived risk, pleasure attitudes and buying intention. To test our model an "ideal" fictitious Website was designed by two graphic designers for a non existent small clothing company directed at the segment of middle class consumers. Manipulating the usability of this Website, another week navigable Website was created to apply our model in a different context. This experiment prepared based on the results previously obtained through a qualitative study developed through seven focus groups. Results show that Internet user develops positive attitudes when navigating through simple, fast and orderly (usable) SME's Websites. This leads to greater buying intentions. Also, as perceived risk decreases the Internet user's buying intention increases significantly.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Touching a Teddy Bear Mitigates Negative Effects of Social Exclusion to Increase Prosocial Behavior
AN  - 1904624864
AB  - There is little empirical research to date that looks at how the deleterious effects of social exclusion can be mitigated. We examined how touching an inanimate object--a teddy bear--might impact the effect of social exclusion on prosocial behavior. Across two studies, we found that socially excluded individuals who touched a teddy bear acted more prosocially as compared to socially excluded individuals who just viewed the teddy bear from a distance. This effect was only observed for socially excluded participants and not for socially included (or control) participants. Overall, the findings suggest that touching a teddy bear mitigates the negative effects of social exclusion to increase prosocial behavior. In Study 2, positive emotion was found to mediate the relationship between touch and prosocial behavior. These results suggest a possible means to attenuate the unpleasant effects of social exclusion.

AN  - 914766866; 201200694
AB  - This study explored the effects of tag questions, hedges, and argument quality on receivers' perceptions of a speaker, perceptions of message quality, cognitive responses, and attitude change. The results showed that tag questions and argument quality directly affected speaker and message quality perceptions and cognitive responses. They also interacted to directly affect perceptions of the speaker's power and credibility. Mediational analyses also showed that tag questions and argument quality had indirect effects on attitude change. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the cognitive processing of and research on linguistic markers of powerlessness.

T1  - Forty Four Years of Debate: The Impact of Race, Community and Conflict
AN  - 1926268851
AB  - Race, Community and Conflict by John Rex and Robert Moore was published in 1967 and had a considerable public impact through press and TV. Forty four years later it is still widely cited in research on British urban society and 'race relations'. It is used in teaching research methods, theory, urban sociology and 'race relations' to undergraduates. This article describes and explains the immediate impact of the book and its more lasting contribution to sociology. Race, Community and Conflict immediately addressed contemporary public issues around immigration and race relations and was the first book systematically to explore the responses of one city administration to the arrival of new migrants drawn in by the local demand for labour. The longer term impact of the book, it is argued, derives from its attempt to create a theoretical framework deriving from both the work of the Chicago School of Sociology and the adoption of a Weberian approach to social class and urban conflict. The combination of theorised structural analysis with detailed local ethnographic approaches to research probably accounts for the book's continued contribution to the teaching of sociology.

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary
AN  - 896195493; 201120578
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Exploring the Impact of Educational Television and Parent-Child Discussions on Children's Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1030869575; 201230152
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the potential of educational television and parent-child discussions about race to change White children's attitudes toward Blacks. Ninety-three White children ages 5-7 and their parents participated. Families were randomly assigned into three experimental groups and one control group. Those in the experimental groups were asked either to show their children five educational videos, with or without additional discussions, or to have race-related discussions with their children without the videos. Improvements were seen in children's out-group attitudes in both the video and discussion groups, whereas in-group attitudes decreased for those who watched videos and had discussions with their parents. Results revealed lack of parental compliance. Even when instructed to do so, only 10% of parents reported having in-depth race-related discussions with their children. Children's racial attitudes were not significantly correlated with those of their parents, but children's perceptions of their parents' attitudes were positively correlated with their own. Reasons for parents' reticence about race discussions, their outcome implications, and directions for future research and intervention are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mediating Punitiveness: Understanding Public Attitudes towards Work-Related Fatality Cases
AN  - 758122886; 201059453
AB  - This paper concerns an empirical investigation into public attitudes towards work-related fatality cases, where organizational offenders cause the death of workers or members of the public. This issue is particularly relevant following the introduction of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 into UK law. Here, as elsewhere, the use of criminal law against companies reflects governmental concerns over public confidence in the law's ability to regulate risk. The empirical findings demonstrate that high levels of public concern over these cases do not translate into punitive attitudes. Such cases are viewed rationally and constructively, and lead to instrumental rather than purely expressive enforcement preferences.

T1  - Desistance and Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders: Facilitation or Hindrance?
AN  - 754040178; 201052254
AB  - In an ideal world, there would be a seamless relationship between interventions that focus on risk factors causally associated with sexual reoffending and the subsequent release of, and ongoing support for, offenders into the community. However, emotionally fueled and uninformed public responses to news of released sex offenders, and the legislation such responses have inspired, severely hinder this process. Our aims in this paper are to review findings of research on community attitudes about sex offenders within a desistance framework. More specifically, we provide a synthesis of the current research literature on attitudes towards sex offenders. Second, we consider in more detail those studies that include community member samples. Third, we review interventions aimed at promoting attitude change amongst professionals working with sex offenders and finally formulate some recommendations for promoting positive attitude change amongst the general public. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Researcher-Led Development of E-Research in the Social Sciences: The Case of an E-Social Science Pilot Demonstrator Project
AN  - 1926272133
AB  - The introduction and use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the process of research is extending beyond research management into research practice itself. This extension of the use of ICT in research is being termed as e-research. The characteristics of e-research are seen as the combination of three interrelated strands, which are: the increased computerization of the research process; research organized more predominantly in the form of distributed networks of researchers, and a strong emphasis on visualization. E-research has become established in the natural sciences but the development of e-research in relation to social sciences is variable and less pervasive. The richness of the social sciences and their variety of practices and engagement in diverse fields of study mean that e-research as utilized in the natural sciences cannot be easily migrated into the social sciences. This paper explores the development of e-research for the social sciences. The paper is based on an ESRC funded e-social science demonstrator project in which social scientists sought to shape the use of Grid ICT technologies in the research process. The project is called: 'Collaborative Analysis of Offenders' Personal and Area-based Social Exclusion': it addresses social exclusion in relation to how individual and neighbourhood effects account for geographical variations of crime patterns and explores the opportunities and challenges offered by e-research to address the research problem. The paper suggests that if e-research is driven from the needs of social research then it can enhance the practice of social science.
