T1  - Intention to seek professional and non‐professional emotional help among Jewish young adults in Israel
AN  - 2673562831
AB  - Young adulthood is a major and significant stage in life encompassing various life transitions which may increase the risk of developing emotional crises. Receiving mental health treatment and turning to nonprofessional resources for support can ease such emotional burdens. However, many of those in need of such help do not turn to professional services and, rather, tend to rely on themselves. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self‐stigma, anticipated risk, anticipated utility, and social support to the intention to seek professional and nonprofessional emotional help among Jewish young adults in Israel. Participants included 282 Jewish Israeli young adults aged 18–30, recruited in person or online. They filled out a self‐report questionnaire, between March and June 2017, regarding intention to seek professional and non‐professional emotional help, attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self‐stigma towards seeking professional emotional help, anticipated risk and anticipated utility of self‐disclosure when seeking professional help, perceived social support and sociodemographic questions. A path analysis model was used to analyse the data. Intention to seek professional help was positively associated with positive attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help and anticipated utility and negatively with self‐stigma and social support. Intention to seek nonprofessional help was positively associated with anticipated utility and social support and negatively with anticipated risk. In addition, indirect effects were found between religious affiliation and previous mental health treatment, and intention to seek professional help, through the mediating effects of attitudes and anticipated utility. Interventions for increasing intention to seek professional and nonprofessional support are important and should include reference to attitudes, anticipated utility, anticipated risk and self‐stigma, and should promote mutual support and highlight the importance of support from close ones. In addition, a model for predicting intention to seek non‐professional help should be developed.

T1  - “Words Aren’t Supposed to Hurt, But They Do”: Sexual and Gender Minority Youth’s Bullying Experiences
AN  - 2669997767
AB  - Sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY) are more likely to experience bullying and violence compared to the youth who do not identify as SGMY, leading to increased risk of poor mental and physical health outcomes, and poor academic performance. Few studies explore the entire range of bullying experienced by sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). The purpose of this study was to qualitatively describe the ways in which SGMY experience bullying victimization. We conducted semi-structured interviews with a diverse sample of 20 SGMY aged 14–18 years (median age 16 years) recruited from online social media. The sample included 10 participants who identified as cisgender girls, 4 who identified as cisgender boys, 2 who identified as transgender, and 4 who identified as another gender identity. Ten participants identified as bisexual, six identified as lesbian, and four identified as gay. Findings indicated six common experiences of bullying among the participants: (a) verbal harassment; (b) gender policing; (c) physical violence; (d) sexual harassment; (e) treated as sexual perpetrators and deviants; and (f) and social exclusion. SGMY described how bullying victimization ranged from overt to concealed attitudes and behaviors, and they articulated how several forms of bullying are likely not experienced by heterosexual and cisgender youth. These results support findings from prior qualitative studies and suggest that efforts to address school-based bullying may benefit from a more complete awareness of the range of bullying victimization experienced by SGMY. Development of multi-item scales of bullying that reflect the six common experiences of bullying presented in this study would allow researchers to quantitatively explore the range of bullying behaviors experienced by SGMY, and would aid in the conceptualization and successful implementation of anti-bullying interventions.

T1  - How the term “white privilege” affects participation, polarization, and content in online communication
AN  - 2686208980
AB  - The language used in online discussions affects who participates in them and how they respond, which can influence perceptions of public opinion. This study examines how the term white privilege affects these dimensions of online communication. In two lab experiments, US residents were given a chance to respond to a post asking their opinions about renaming college buildings. Using the term white privilege in the question decreased the percentage of whites who supported renaming. In addition, those whites who remained supportive when white privilege was mentioned were less likely to create an online post, while opposing whites and non-whites showed no significant difference. The term also led to more low-quality posts among both whites and non-whites. The relationship between question language and the way participants framed their responses was mediated by their support or opposition for renaming buildings. This suggests that the effects of the term white privilege on the content of people’s responses is primarily affective. Overall, mention of white privilege seems to create internet discussions that are less constructive, more polarized, and less supportive of racially progressive policies. The findings have the potential to support meaningful online conversation and reduce online polarization.

T1  - Violence Against Media Personas: A Comparative Study of Women Journalists in Pakistan and England
AN  - 2672393073
AB  - Gender is a critical tool for studying power dynamics within various organisations. The primary objective of this study is to examine how gender-targeted assault against females has increased in the profession of journalism. Below is a comprehensive picture of the extent of dangerous situations to which many women working in news media of England and Pakistan were subjected to. This research presents the insidious coercion endured by female journalists and considers how these incidents affect their ability to conduct their work on a professional level in the media industries of each country. It is important to note that the objective of this study is not to assess the number of women journalists who experienced these incidents, but rather to gauge the nature and frequency of these types of violations. The research is drawn from feminist theory, specifically, social feminist perspectives comprising discrimination of various levels in workplace with regards to gender. The data is collected using quantitative survey research techniques through purposive sampling utilising the snowball approach. Questionnaires were distributed amongst 50 women journalists from Pakistan and England. This research emphasises the consequences of psychological, verbal, technological, physical and sexual abuse as experienced by female media correspondents. The outcomes highlighted the cumulative proportions of incidents of various forms of violenc experienced by these women.

T1  - Associations between perceived material deprivation, social support and violent victimization among Chinese children
AN  - 2656850530
AB  - Background Evidence has consistently shown that poverty is associated with the violent victimization of children. Most studies have used family income as a predictor of child poverty. However, it is unclear how multidimensional material deprivation perceived by children is associated with their victimization experiences. Objectives This study aimed to examine the association between children's perceived material deprivation and self-reported violent victimization, as well as the role of perceived social support in mediating this relationship. Participants and setting This cross-sectional school-based study included 445 children aged between 8 and 16 years living in Shenzhen, China. Methods The conventional crime module of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire (JVQ), the material deprivation index based on the Poverty and Social Exclusion in Hong Kong (PSEHK) project, and the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) were employed to measure children's experiences of violent victimization, material deprivation, and perceived social support. Results This study discovered that, when income and other factors were controlled for, children's perceived material deprivation was positively associated with self-reported violent victimization (β = 0.31, p < .01). However, the role played by material deprivation was undermined by high levels of perceived social support, demonstrating the full mediating relationship between perceived material deprivation and violent victimization. Conclusion The findings of this study underline the importance of understanding and reducing children's perceived material deprivation in poverty alleviation and child victimization prevention. Social support is vital for children who perceive themselves as living in deprived circumstances.

T1  - Teaching College in the Time of COVID-19: Gender and Race Differences in Faculty Emotional Labor
AN  - 2653414789
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic placed new teaching demands upon faculty that may have exacerbated existing race and gender disparities in the amount of emotional labor they perform. The present study surveyed 182 full-time tenured and tenure-track faculty from three small private liberal arts colleges to examine the effect of social and professional statuses on emotional labor (i.e., managing the expression of emotions to meet job requirements) during the emergency switch to remote instruction in spring 2020. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression revealed that white cisgender men performed less emotional labor than Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) cisgender men, BIPOC cisgender women, and white cisgender women and gender non-conforming (GNC) faculty. Student demands for special favors fully mediated the relationship between intersectional race and gender identity and self-directed emotional labor and partially mediated its relationship with student-directed emotional labor. We conclude that the status shield afforded white cisgender men by their race and gender protected them from student demands that would have required them to engage in as much emotional labor as faculty with other intersectional race and gender identities during the pandemic. We discuss considering differences in emotional labor when making personnel decisions.

T1  - ‘This is not who we are’: Gendered bordering practices, ontological insecurity, and lines of continuity under the Trump presidency
AN  - 2637030062
AB  - The Trump presidency ushered in a heightened sense of ontological insecurity in the US, based on a national self-narrative that portrayed an emasculated America. Trump promised to return the US to primacy by pursuing policies and practices that focused on border protection, militarisation, and the vilification of external others, while amplifying racial tensions within the country. From caging immigrant children at the border, to an enabling of white supremacy and the Capitol riots, Trump's presidency was broadly seen as aberration in the self-narrative of America as a tolerant, democratic nation. In this article, I am interested in how gendered bordering practices inform ontological (in)security in Trump's narrative of the nation, domestic and external policy, and discourses. While Trump's electoral loss to Biden in 2020 has been described as a ‘return to normal’, this article instead considers how Trump's presidency exhibited lines of continuity when examined through a gender lens. Understanding how masculinism informs ideas of ontological security reveals how notions of gendered bordering, hierarchy, and ordering have been persistent threads in US politics, rather than simply an anomaly under Trump. This suggests greater potential to read ontological security in more complex terms through gendered bordering practices.

T1  - A shame of inches: Are teams with black head coaches more heavily penalized in Division 1 college football?
AN  - 2656060751
AB  - BackgroundA popular line of media discourse has sought to provide explanations for college football's lack of diversity in the coaching ranks. A related effort has recently sought to explain why black coaches are faced with institutional barriers to success in athletic fields. While research on race and the sociology of sport has frequently focused on racial characteristics and expectations of players for on‐field penalization, this literature neglected to examine racialized leadership positions such as coaching. Further, the vast majority of this line of literature that has examined racial leadership has explored the effects of race on hiring and promotion decisions off the field rather than on‐field dynamics.ObjectiveThis article fills this gap by exploring the relationship between the race of college football coaches and the level of on‐field penalization their teams incur. Are teams coached by black coaches more heavily penalized than those coaches by non‐black coaches?MethodsUsing data from a merged unique data set and a two‐step approach comprising two statistical procedures, we explore this question empirically. We first examine the mean levels of penalties at the game level using a comparison of means, followed by a panel analysis of penalties at the yearly‐school level.ResultsIn our comparison of means across all games played between white and black coaches in the 2019/2020 college football season, we find that black coaches are more heavily penalized than white coaches in terms of both penalties per game as well as penalty yardage. Findings of our longitudinal analysis covering all Division 1 college football teams from the college football playoff era (2014/2015 season until the 2019/2020 season) reveal that teams coached by black coaches receive more penalties per game than do teams coached by non‐black coaches.ConclusionTo conclude, we discuss implications for these findings and suggest ameliorative prescriptions to combat bias in college sports. We contextualize our findings within the context of racialized organizational processes in college sports.

T1  - Low Psychological Well-being in Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) During the Shelter-in-Place Orders to Prevent the COVID-19 Spread: Results from a Nationwide Study
AN  - 2626113096
AB  - IntroductionLittle is known about how sheltering in place to contain the spread of COVID-19 over extended periods affects individuals’ psychological well-being. This study’s objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM’s (men who have sex with men) low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context.MethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted online across Brazil (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling and Facebook posts. Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and the respective confidence intervals (CI95%).ResultsThe prevalence of low psychological well-being found in the sample was 7.9%. Associated factors were belonging to the youngest group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90–4.01), having polyamorous relationships (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51–5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42–8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06–2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04–3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44–4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23–2.69)ConclusionThe well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. The variables that contributed the most to this outcome include social isolation, relationships established with partners, and sexual behavior.Policy ImplicationsPlanning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM’s resilience by adopting safe strategies and behavior.

T1  - Digital Being(s): Platform Entanglement and Everyday Life in 21st-Century India
AN  - 2687827030
AB  - The article analyses the centrality of new media platforms in the everyday life of contemporary India. It claims that the representations of everyday life saturated with media technology in films and web series helps us to understand the ways new media has become central to the life experience in India over a rather short period. By engaging with philosophical and sociological theories, and by approaching the question and the theory through several cinematic examples, the article shall probe the ways in which we have become digital beings, and to which extent this has been mediated by neoliberal capitalism, as the platforms are lucrative business ventures of different global media corporations. The article claims that COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 resulted in many different attempts to articulate the centrality of technology to our everyday life. Various films and web series released during the pandemic and commenting on the effect of the pandemic on our everyday life, attempt to demonstrate, at least in part, the creative power of technology in India and shows ways how technology helps forge an alternative sociality under the regime of social distancing. However, the article takes a critical stance in demonstrating that media technologies, their impact on our everyday life and the logic that govern them are far more problematic than it seems.

T1  - "Why fix it if ain't broke": Nature and extent of crime in the railway environment in South Africa
AN  - 2678517634
AB  - This article explores the nature and extent of crime in the railway environment in South Africa. Crimes against Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, Transnet Freight Rail, Gautrain, and commuters are prevalent and the victims are being exposed to serious damage emanating from criminal activities. The challenges and implications for individuals and businesses, rich or poor consumers are recurrent themes in this study. A qualitative research approach was adopted to follow a non-probability purposive sample comprising 25 participants from the South African Police Service Rapid Rail Police Units. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews from research participants deployed in the Division: Visible Policing. The findings highlighted that the most prevalent crimes are cable theft, robberies and malicious property damage. The targeted trains are the Metro trains that operate locally, as they transport many commuters because it is the affordable mode of public transport in South Africa. The perpetrators also target this mode of transport because the train stations have an open system where perpetrators can easily access the entrance, therefore some do not even buy tickets and board the trains illegally. It is understood that Gautrain have a closed system and the security is advanced and watertight because of extra security measures such as the closed-circuit television cameras. Based on the findings, effective implementation of policies to improve safety is essential. Critical dialogues between all relevant.

T1  - Loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Relationships with social media identity bubbles
AN  - 2672382213
AB  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide. This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data (n = 735) collected in 2017–2020 on the Finnish population. Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data (n = 840) collected in 2019–2021 representing the Finnish working population. We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis. A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic. Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic, psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population. Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals. The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic. Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely.

T1  - Social participation and posttraumatic growth: The serial mediation of hope, social support, and reappraisal
AN  - 2615495785
AB  - In light of the global crisis created by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019, the goal of the study was to detect factors that might enhance people's ability to experience positive psychological change during traumatic events. As such, this study examined the relationship between social participation and posttraumatic growth (PTG) during the coronavirus outbreak and tested the mediating role of hope, social support, and cognitive reappraisal in explaining this relationship. The sample consisted of 275 participants (21.8% male, and 78.2% female, with an average age of 33.42, SD = 13.63), subjected to social‐distancing regulations during this period. Results demonstrated a serial mediation model in which social participation predicted PTG directly and indirectly through hope (pathways and agency), social support, and cognitive reappraisal. The importance of social participation in nourishing personal resources and practical implications including the need for prevention programs are discussed.

T1  - A social identity perspective on conformity to cyber aggression among early adolescents on WhatsApp
AN  - 2603960116
AB  - Cyber aggressive behaviors such as nonconsensual image sharing, nasty comments, and social exclusion frequently take place on WhatsApp. These behaviors often involve group processes, where adolescents conform to peers’ behaviors. WhatsApp is pre‐eminently suited for group‐communication among adolescents, and, thus, may facilitate conformity to such behaviors. However, research on conformity on WhatsApp is scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine if and how the social identity perspective on group behavior may explain cyber aggression on WhatsApp. Specifically, we examined how social identification relates to conformity to cyber aggression on WhatsApp. In a preregistered survey, 647 early adolescents answered questions about social identification with group members and conformity to behavior of a WhatsApp group. Hierarchical multiple regression and moderated mediation analyses point toward an indirect, positive relation between the centrality component of social identification and conformity to cyber aggression, mediated by perceived social pressure to conform. These findings contribute to the literature by extending the social identity perspective to conformity on WhatsApp. Further exploration of this research line within the field of cyber aggression is warranted, because this can help improve applied interventions to reduce conformity to cyber aggression.

T1  - The CRISIS Survey: The Catholic Church's Work with Immigrants in a Period of Crisis
AN  - 2605548641
AB  - Over the last five years, the Center for Migration Studies of New York (CMS) has conducted four surveys of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions, programs, and ministries in the United States. These surveys identify the multi-faceted needs of immigrants and refugees, and examine the successes and challenges of Catholic institutions in responding to them. CMS administered its most recent survey, the Catholic Refugee and Immigrant Service Integration Survey (the “CRISIS Survey”) from December 14, 2020 through February 5, 2021. This survey explored the work of Catholic institutions during the Trump administration and the COVID-19 pandemic.The CRISIS Survey documents the reach, diversity, and productivity of Catholic institutions that worked with immigrants and refugees during a pandemic that particularly devastated their communities and an administration whose policies and rhetoric made their work far more difficult. At a time of rampant “Catholic decline” narratives, the survey also documents the reach, vitality, and relevance of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions. It identifies the obstacles encountered by immigrants in accessing Catholic programs and ministries — both organizational (funding, staffing, and siting) and exogenous (federal policies, the pandemic, and community opposition). It underscores the threat posed by US immigration policies to immigrants and to the work of Catholic institutions.Survey respondents reported that they offered new services during this period, such as:          Financial assistance for families, particularly those at risk of losing housing or utilities.              COVID-19 testing, education, contact tracing, and quarantine services.              Mental health services.              Grief support and assistance with funeral expenses.              Delivery of food and sanitation supplies for infected and other homebound persons.              Voter registration and Census promotion activities.      Virtually all respondents provided services remotely during the pandemic. Many reported on difficulties faced by immigrants in accessing their services, due to poor internet connections, limited computer access, and lack of communications technology and training. Respondents identified several factors that negatively affected immigrants’ access to their services pre-pandemic. As in previous CMS surveys, these factors included lack of immigration status, negative community attitudes toward immigrants, fear of apprehension (particularly after traffic stops) and deportation, public transportation deficiencies, stigma over receipt of mental health services, and identification requirements to access public benefits. Respondents also reported on obstacles in working with immigrants during the pandemic. These included the pandemic itself, limited funding, demand that outpaced resources, government restrictions on relief and benefit eligibility, and (particularly for students) living arrangements, work, and family caretaking responsibilities. Respondents overwhelmingly believed that immigration enforcement, tied to fear of deportation, very negatively or somewhat negatively affected participation in their services and programs. In Catholic terms, they reported that nativist immigration policies, rhetoric, and media sources interfered with their practice of discipleship. One respondent stated, “Fear of ICE and round-ups, locally in our state and nationally, along with negative immigration rhetoric from the out-going president have made our clients very fearful to access services they rightly qualify for.” A healthcare provider reported that immigrants were “avoiding or delaying seeking treatment for COVID-19 for fear of apprehension and/or deportation.” Many said that enforcement partnerships between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and states and localities made immigrants fearful of reporting crimes or accessing government facilities. One said that potential sponsors feared coming forward to reunify with children. Respondents also cited as problems delays in family reunification, barriers to asylum-seekers entering the United States, decreased refugee admissions, and the Trump administration's rule on the public charge ground of inadmissibility. The report recommends that Catholic institutions take stock of the creative new programs, skills and capacities that they have developed during the pandemic and build on them. It also recommends that scholars and researchers prioritize independent, person-centered research that critically analyzes the work of Catholic immigrant-serving institutions. Such research would ask whether these institutions, in the words of Pope Francis, are putting “the person at the center, in his or her many aspects” and honoring the “fundamental equality” of every person. It would draw on the perspectives of immigrants served by Catholic institutions to examine the degree to which these institutions advance the rights, participation, and wellbeing of immigrants and their families in US society. Finally, it would analyze how Catholic institutions work with each other — within Arch/dioceses, regionally, nationally, and across these realms — in response to the cross-cutting needs of immigrants. The report recommends that Catholic institutions develop programmatic plans to ensure that immigrants can return to or can continue to access their programs and ministries as the pandemic subsides. These plans will need to combine communication strategies, financial support, and services such as transportation and childcare. In addition, Catholic institutions should make it a high priority to ensure that immigrants can access the infrastructure, platforms, and training that will allow them to access virtual services. They should also develop strategies to engage Catholics who do not understand, who ignore, or who work at cross-purposes to Catholic teaching and policy positions in this area. Finally, they should redouble their work with the administration and Congress to reform US immigration laws, and with states and localities to promote welcoming and inclusive communities.

T1  - User-generated nationalism: interactions with religion, race, and partisanship in everyday talk online
AN  - 2577600512
AB  - This article examines how the nationalist imagination structures cyberspace from the bottom up, or what I call user-generated nationalism. It also looks at the interplay between nationalism and other, non-spatial modes of social identification. My analysis of a month of tweets indicates that religious, racialized, and partisan identities are quite pronounced online, but they also tend to be conflated with nationalism. I argue that nationalism is not simply banal itself: because of its fixity in place and political correctness, it is used to lend legitimacy to and ‘banalize’ other identities. This dynamic is key to understanding the explosion of right-wing populism around the ‘world of nations’ – especially the success of populist leaders in normalizing religious, racialized, and partisan identifications – and the central role being played by digital media in this process.

T1  - The Political Culture of Asian Brazilians
TT  - A Cultura Política dos Brasileiros Asiáticos
AN  - 2685100676
AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between race and politics for Asian Brazilians. Using data from the Latin American Public Opinion Survey, we examine this relationship along two axes: cognitive orientation towards politics and institutional confidence. We use factor analysis to create representative indices of these axes and estimate regression models using race as a predictive variable. We find no evidence that Asian Brazilians differ from white Brazilians along either of these two axes. However, we find that a university education has an especially strong relationship with cognitive orientation towards politics for Asian Brazilians. On average, Asian Brazilians with a university education had a cognitive orientation towards politics score 17% higher than Asian Brazilians without a university education, though we do not find a similar effect for institutional confidence. Overall, we find that ethnic identity, particularly for Asians, does not have a strong effect on either of the axes but education has different effects on them between different ethnic groups.Alternate abstract:Poucos estudos têm examinado a relação entre raça e política para Brasileiros Asiáticos. Usando dados do Projeto de Opinião Pública da América Latina, examinamos essa relação através de dois eixos: orientação cognitiva à política e confiança institucional. Nós usamos análise fatorial para propor índices representativos e estimamos modelos de regressão usando raça como uma variável preditiva. Não encontramos evidência de que Brasileiros Asiáticos diferem de Brasileiros Brancos em ambos os eixos. Porém, achamos que a educação superior tem uma relação particularmente forte com a orientação cognitiva à política para Brasileiros Asiáticos. Em média, Brasileiros Asiáticos com educação superior têm uma pontuação de orientação cognitiva à política 17% mais alta do que Brasileiros Asiáticos sem educação superior, apesar de não encontramos um efeito semelhante para a confiança institucional. No geral, descobrimos que a identidade étnica, particularmente para os asiáticos, não tem um forte efeito em nenhum dos eixos, mas a educação tem efeitos diferentes entre os diferentes grupos étnicos.

T1  - Stuck in the past or living in the present? Temporal focus and the spread of COVID-19
AN  - 2569412667
AB  - Research has shown that the temporal focus of individuals can have a real effect on behavior. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic.

T1  - Ghosting and orbiting: An analysis of victims’ experiences
AN  - 2541700447
AB  - Ghosting is the practice of ending a relationship without explaining to the partner and avoiding any communication attempts. Orbiting is identical to ghosting, but the disengager still visibly follows the former partner on social media. Despite the increasing attention that ghosting and orbiting have gained in the popular press, they remain largely unexplored phenomena in scientific inquiry. In this work, we explored the psychological and behavioral reactions to ghosting and orbiting from the victim’s perspective, comparing them to the experience of being rejected through direct communication. Participants were randomly assigned to recall one of three conditions (ghosting, orbiting, and rejection), and the reports of 208 young adults were analyzed through qualitative thematic content analysis. The results described different stages of reactions that follow event detection and that are respectively characterized by 1) surprise and confusion, 2) anger, sadness, and guilt, 3) attempts of relational repair, 4) acceptance. The specificities of being a victim of ghosting and orbiting are presented, comparing them with social rejection. The results are discussed in the light of the existing literature on social exclusion, suggesting that ghosting and orbiting can be considered forms of ostracism. Connections between the proposed stage model and traditional relationship dissolution theories are highlighted, and relevant implications for future research and interventions are presented.

T1  - Impact of online racism on psychological distress and alcohol use severity: Testing ethnic-racial socialization and silence about race as moderators
AN  - 2536821338
AB  - Given the psychological deficits associated with online racism, we examined whether ethnic-racial socialization (cultural socialization, promotion of mistrust, and preparation for racial bias) and silence about race, would moderate the impact of online racism on psychological distress and alcohol use severity by conducting latent moderated structural equation modeling with data collected from 380 racial/ethnic minority young adults (Mage = 32.25, SD = 11.28). Online racism was significantly and positively related to distress and alcohol use severity. Promotion of mistrust and preparation for bias moderated the link between online-mediated exposure to racist reality and psychological distress such that this relationship was significant at low to mean levels of these messages but not at high levels; however, individuals reporting a high frequency of messages sustained higher psychological distress. Promotion of mistrust and silence about race exacerbated alcohol use associated with racism in personal online interactions. Silence about race moderated alcohol use associated with vicarious exposure to online racism such that the link was significant at high levels of silence messages but not at low to mean levels. Findings seem unconvincing of ethnic-racial socialization as a protective function and supportive of silence about race as a detrimental socialization practice in dealing with online racism.

T1  - Investigating the role of E‐contact and self‐disclosure on improving Turkish‐Kurdish interethnic relations
AN  - 2543071507
AB  - While recent research has started to pay more attention to the role of contact strategies on promoting intergroup harmony between Turkish and Kurdish communities, the effectiveness of a novel form of indirect contact strategy, E‐contact—where participants engage in a cooperative and structured online interaction with an individual from the outgroup—has not yet been tested. Across two studies (NStudy 1 = 110, NStudy 2 = 176), we investigated the effects of E‐contact among Turks on promoting positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies toward Kurds, testing outgroup trust and intergroup anxiety as mediators and incorporating a distinction between lower and higher self‐disclosure conditions. As expected, E‐contact led to more positive outgroup attitudes, as well as greater approach tendencies and decreased avoidance tendencies through increased outgroup trust (Studies 1 and 2) and reduced intergroup anxiety (Study 2). Study 2 also found that E‐contact produced lower perceived interethnic conflict through increased outgroup trust. While both lower and higher personal disclosure conditions provided similar effects in the two studies, E‐contact with heightened self‐disclosure was especially effective at promoting more positive outgroup attitudes and reducing avoidance tendencies. Findings highlight potential benefits of using E‐contact as a prejudice‐reduction strategy in conflict settings.

T1  - Using social media data for assessing children's exposure to violence during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2539557029
AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought unforeseen challenges that could forever change the way societies prioritize and deal with public health issues. The approaches to contain the spread of the virus have entailed governments issuing recommendations on social distancing, lockdowns to restrict movements, and suspension of services. Objective There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis and the measures adopted by countries in response to the pandemic may have led to an upsurge in violence against children. Added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods and social isolation may have led to a rise in children's experience of violence in the home. Extended online presence by children may have resulted in increased exposure to abusive content and cyberbullying. Participants and setting This study uses testimonial-based and conversational-based data collected from social media users. Methods Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to measure increases in abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to family violence before and after the start of the stay-at-home restrictions. Results Violence-related subreddits were among the topics with the highest growth after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of Twitter data shows a significant increase in abusive content generated during the stay-at-home restrictions. Conclusions The collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures offers insights into the wide-ranging risks that children are exposed to in times of crisis. As societies shift towards a new normal, which places emerging technology, remote working and online learning at its center, and in anticipation of similar future threats, governments and other stakeholders need to put in place measures to protect children from violence.

T1  - Masculinity, Ritual, and Racialized Status Threat: Examining Mass Shooter Manifestos Using Structural Topic Models
AN  - 2508509265
AB  - Both popular media and research often frame mass shootings as an individual issue having to do with mental illness or other individual differences. This work has unfolded in much the same fashion as that on other negative or anti‐social behaviors—such as the individual pathologization of suicide or rape. However, what this work has shown empirically is that there are often a set of circumstances that are uniquely social that motivate such actions. Following work in sociology, which offers social psychological and cultural explanations for gun violence, we argue that mass shooter motivations reflect social conditions—especially those that instantiate toxic masculinity, social exclusion, and racism—conducive to these events. This article uses a computational textual modeling approach to analyze the distinct social logics that motivate mass shooters. To do this, we identify a sample of 27 publicly available mass shooter “manifestos,” or documents left behind by shooters following their actions. Using topic models, we show that mass shooters exhibit a variety of preoccupations that underlie their actions. While shooters can exhibit a multitude of possible motivations, we find that expressions of masculine overcompensation, ritualistic responses to exclusion, and racialized status threat are prominent features of mass shooter manifestos, corroborating recent sociological explanations of mass shootings.

T1  - Contested hope for the future - Rural refugee reception as municipal survival?
AN  - 2543839789
AB  - Rural communities in the inland areas of Northern Sweden have long suffered from a steady population decline as young people, particularly women, have moved to the growing urban areas for education/employment. However, in recent years, alongside strategies for survival relating to tourism/hospitality industry, refugee reception has emerged as a strategy for survival whereby these rural municipalities seek to staunch the downward spiral of decline by accepting refugees in the hope that this will provide not only job opportunities but also support for local services. Using thematic analysis, we focus on media representations of rural refugee reception in small municipalities Northern Sweden and aim to contribute to an understanding of how spatial and social relations are reproduced through these representations; to understand in how 'the rural' is constructed in relation to power relations such as race and gender and how these interact with a more explicit spatial power dimension. We are interested in understanding rural refugee reception as a contested hope for the future – a strategy for survival. Our analysis shows that the media highlight the stories of how the municipalities set their hopes on refugee reception to 'save' the place not only by bringing in new, younger inhabitants, but also employment opportunities. However, it also shows that refugee reception may become merely a short-term, temporary solution and not something that challenges or changes the more general migratory patterns in Sweden.

T1  - The tale of transparent and predictable working conditions intertwined with work-life balance: Assessing the impact of the new social policy directives on decent working conditions and social protection
AN  - 2466010331
AB  - Precarious employment is often associated with job insecurity and limited corollary entitlements to income support. More specifically, what makes the jobs precarious are factors such as in-work poverty and low pay, insufficient labour law and social security protection, high levels of stress and health problems, limited career development and training options or low levels of collective rights. Precarious workers engaged in atypical forms of employment such as casual work, zero-hours contracts or platform-mediated work are particularly prone to experiencing precarious working conditions and often consequently, in-work poverty and thus social exclusion. A question therefore emerges as to the adequate response at EU level to combat precarious employment and provide for decent jobs with fair working conditions including protection against discrimination and also access to adequate social protection. Against this background, this article takes stock of the two first legally binding roll-out initiatives from the European Pillar of Social Rights (EPSR), namely Directive (EU) 2019/1152 on transparent and predictable working conditions in the European Union and Directive (EU) 2019/1158 on work-life balance for parents and carers, to assess their impact on decent working and employment conditions, and social protection, while also exploring in greater detail their coverage and potential limitations.

T1  - Responsibilization and Sexual Stigma Under Austerity: Surveying Public Support for Government-Funded PrEP in England
AN  - 2449451437
AB  - IntroductionUnder austerity, governments shift responsibilities for social welfare to individuals. Such responsibilization can be intertwined with pre-existing social stigmas, with sexually stigmatized individuals blamed more for health problems due to “irresponsible” sexual behavior. To understand how sexual stigma affects attitudes on government healthcare expenditures, we examine public support for government-provisioned PrEP in England at a time when media narratives cast the drug as an expensive benefit for a small, irresponsible social group and the National Health Service’s long-term sustainability was in doubt.MethodsThis paper uses data from an original survey (N = 738) conducted in September 2016, when public opinion should be most sensitive to sexual stigma. A survey experiment tests how the way beneficiaries of PrEP were described affected support for NHS provision of it. Contrary to expectations, we found that support was high (mean = 3.86 on a scale of 1 to 5) irrespective of language used or beneficiary group mentioned. Differences between conditions were negligible.DiscussionSexual stigma does not diminish support for government-funded PrEP, which may be due to reverence for the NHS; resistance to responsibilization generally; or just to HIV, with the public influenced by sympathy and counter-messaging.Social policy implicationsHaving misjudged public attitudes, it may be difficult for the government to continue to justify not funding PrEP; the political rationale for contracting out its provision is unnecessary and flawed. With public opinion resilient to responsibilization narratives and sexual stigma even under austerity, welfare retrenchment may be more difficult than social policymakers presume.

T1  - LONELINESS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: THE MEDIATIONAL ROLES OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT SEEKING
AN  - 2473242332
AB  - Introduction: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and shelter-at-home have become necessary for public health and safety in the United States. This period of social isolation may be a risk factor for mental health problems, particularly among young adults for whom rates of loneliness are already high. Young adults also engage in more social media use than other age groups, a form of socialization associated with adverse effects on mental health, including loneliness and depression. Methods: The current study examined potential mediating roles of social media use and social support seeking on the relationship between age and loneliness symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 1,674 adults who completed an online survey regarding depressive symptoms, loneliness, coping strategies, and changes to their daily lives as a result of the pandemic. Results: Results indicated that young adults were lonelier than older adults during the pandemic, showed a greater increase in social media use, and lower social support seeking. Higher increases in social media use and lower social support seeking mediated the relationship between age group and loneliness. Discussion: Findings are discussed in context of prior research and potential effects of stress and isolation during the pandemic. Clinical implications and suggestions for intervention are elaborated.

T1  - Shifting the Contours of Public Engagement through Ethnographic Filmmaking: Politics, Im/migrant Policing, and Farmworker Health Made Visible
AN  - 2470752368
AB  - The article discusses our ethnographic film project that documents the effects of aggressive immigrant policing on farmworker health in North Carolina. We reflect on our filmmaking techniques and collaborative process, which challenge anti‐immigrant rhetoric by engaging viewers with humanizing representations of the predicaments and health stressors many immigrants face. Critical insights from observational cinema inform how usually unseen intimacies of everyday life expressed through personal testimonies and visual gestures can evoke empathy and reflection. We argue that such visual public anthropology is needed, as images of the immigrant experience in the United States are often distorted in contemporary political discourse.

T1  - Reimagining US Colombianidades: Transnational subjectivities, cultural expressions, and political contestations
AN  - 2438135616
AB  - On 2 February 2020, while we were in the process of composing this introduction, more than a hundred million global television viewers witnessed perhaps the most hotly discussed Latina/o/x live musical event since the electrifying 1999 Grammy performance of “Livin’ La Vida Loca” by Puerto Rican entertainer Ricky Martin. The Latinidad on display in 2020 was distinctly female, Colombian, and Puerto Rican: Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined the Super Bowl halftime show, making them the first two Latinas in history to perform on it together. Juxtaposed against the racial tensions of the post–Colin Kaepernick National Football League; white middle-class viewers’ concerns about the ostensibly “vulgar” spectacle of two unapologetically sexy and talented Latinas; critiques regarding the show’s centering of white Latinidad1 ; and the rampant anti-Latina/o/x sentiment of the Trump era, the 2020 halftime show offered many insights into the fundamental nature of US Colombianidades. It was, we argue, a critical moment in the potential rebranding of Colombian identity in the global popular imagination, in which US Colombians and Latina/o/xs become central, not peripheral, to the collective celebrations and histories of US cultural touchstones such as the Superbowl, as problematic as they may be.

T1  - Wildfire in the news media: An intersectional critical frame analysis
AN  - 2443645456
AB  - The unprecedented 2015 wildfire season in northern Saskatchewan, Canada resulted in the largest evacuation in the province's history. The depiction of such environmental hazards in the news media is one mechanism that can, even inadvertently, reinforce historical and contemporary social inequalities through its discursive construction of the event and actors involved. We modified and applied a critical frame analysis (CFA) to explicitly reveal how intersecting social identity attributes and associated power relations emerged in media narratives of the Saskatchewan wildfire event, as well as how dominant narratives were challenged. Findings derived from two local and two national news sources revealed that mainstream media largely reflected and reinforced a normative characterization of wildfire response and planning that is highly gendered and exclusionary. Specifically, this characterization constructed intersecting dualisms, giving agency to men and historically male-dominated organizations and casting women, as well as northern and Indigenous communities, as passive residents in need of protection. Our application of the framework also revealed how dominant narratives were challenged through alternative discourses that recognized the agency of community members. A key contribution of the CFA framework, when combined with an intersectional lens, is its ability to draw attention to the ways in which identity attributes (e.g., gender, race) and associated power relations (e.g., patriarchy, racism, colonialism) work together, and to thereby generate insights that can help redefine policy problems and ultimately, more effectively address the social dimensions of environmental hazards.

T1  - The School as a Double-Edged Panopticon—Increased Anxiety and Deflated Islamic Identities: A Child-Centered Perspective on the Trojan Horse Affair
AN  - 2423101249
AB  - The Trojan Hose Affair scandal alleged that there was a hardline extremist Islamism plot to take over British state schools in Birmingham. While community groups and government officials battled to take control of the narrative, the pupils who were ultimately at the center of the scandal, were not considered. This paper is based on research conducted in 2015, with students at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse Affair. Through seven one-to-one interviews and a group discussion, the research finds that students portrayed their selves in a state of constant psychological reconciliation due to the heightened mediatization, racialization, and securitization of Islam and Muslims, during and after the Trojan Horse affair. This caused increased levels of anxiety in students, which peaked around the constant surveillance through the gaze of the media, teachers, and Ofsted inspectors, creating a double-edged Panopticon. The paper particularly underscores student concerns for potential social exclusion and discrimination they may experience as a result of the school affiliation.

T1  - Human values and ideological beliefs as predictors of attitudes toward immigrants across 20 countries: The country‐level moderating role of threat
AN  - 2384449751
AB  - Immigration is a worldwide subject of interest, and studies about attitudes toward immigrants have been frequent due to immigration crises in different locations across the globe. We aimed at understanding individual‐level effects of human values and ideological beliefs (Right‐Wing Authoritarianism—RWA, and Social Dominance Orientation—SDO) on attitudes toward immigrants, and whether country‐level variables (perception of Islamic fundamentalism as a threat, perception of immigrants as a threat, and international migrant stock) moderate these relations. With representative samples from 20 countries (N = 21,362; the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania), and using Multilevel Bayesian regressions, results showed the negative effect of RWA, SDO, and existence values on attitudes toward immigrants, and the positive effects of suprapersonal and interactive values. Cross‐level interactions indicated that the effects of RWA, SDO, and suprapersonal and existence values were intensified in countries with societally high levels of perceiving Islamic fundamentalism as a threat. International migrant stock served as a country‐level moderator for the effects of SDO and RWA only. When country‐level moderators were included simultaneously, Islamic fundamentalism as a threat was the most consistent moderator. Framing theory is offered as a plausible explanation of these results.

T1  - Governing through <i>kodokushi</i>. Japan’s lonely deaths and their impact on community self-government
AN  - 2564512307
AB  - As more and more older persons in Japan are living in one-person-households, the number of unaccompanied and undetected deaths has risen as well. These so-called “lonely deaths” (kodokushi) have been problematized in various contexts over the last decades. Popular mass media reports interpret the growing number of kodokushi as a sign of the demise of traditional values, while academic publications interlink the issue with broader societal challenges such as social isolation, poverty, or social exclusion. This article traces how kodokushi developed from a rare event at the margins of society into a buzzword in the center of public attention. It discusses how the contemporary discourse constructs kodokushi as a “bad death” and how this negative image is utilized as an incentive to construct efficient local welfare networks. In this regard, the article introduces the example of a local initiative that tries to reduce the number of lonely deaths through raising the residents’ awareness of the issue and through re-activating neighborhood life. By doing this, it promotes a certain set of values and rules, therefore not only governing the residents’ deaths, but also attempting to positively influence their lifestyles. The article reveals the effects and practical problems of this strategy.

T1  - Mortgage Discrimination and Racial/Ethnic Concentration Are Associated with Same-Race/Ethnicity Partnering among People Who Inject Drugs in 19 US Cities
AN  - 2352897456
AB  - Racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships (partners share the same race/ethnicity) has been associated with racial/ethnic disparities in HIV. Structural racism may partly determine racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships. This study estimated associations of racial/ethnic concentration and mortgage discrimination against Black and Latino residents with racial/ethnic homophily in sexual partnerships among 7847 people who inject drugs (PWID) recruited from 19 US cities to participate in CDC’s National HIV Behavioral Surveillance. Racial/ethnic concentration was defined by two measures that respectively compared ZIP code-level concentrations of Black residents to White residents and Latino residents to White residents, using the Index of Concentration at the Extremes. Mortgage discrimination was defined by two measures that respectively compared county-level mortgage loan denial among Black applicants to White applicants and mortgage loan denial among Latino applicants to White applicants, with similar characteristics (e.g., income, loan amount). Multilevel logistic regression models were used to estimate associations. Interactions of race/ethnicity with measures of racial/ethnic concentration and mortgage discrimination were added to the final multivariable model and decomposed into race/ethnicity-specific estimates. In the final multivariable model, among Black PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Black vs. White residents and counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Latino residents was associated with lower odds of homophily among Black PWID. Among Latino PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Latino vs. White residents and counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Latino residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with lower odds of homophily among Latino PWID. Among White PWID, living in ZIP codes with higher concentrations of Black or Latino residents vs. White residents was associated with lower odds of homophily, but living in counties with higher mortgage discrimination against Black residents was associated with higher odds of homophily. Racial/ethnic segregation may partly drive same race/ethnicity sexual partnering among PWID. Future empirical evidence linking these associations directly or indirectly (via place-level mediators) to HIV/STI transmission will determine how eliminating discriminatory housing policies impact HIV/STI transmission.

T1  - Local–Migrant Interaction in Everyday Life in an Ancient Tourism Town
AN  - 2562160805
AB  - Daily interaction is a primary means of understanding social change which is of vital importance for community well-being. In tourism host communities, daily interactions among different resident groups reflect tourism’s effects which are directly related to tourists’ experiences and community harmony. In this exploratory article, grounded theory was applied to analyze daily interactions between locals and migrants in Zhouzhuang, the first ancient tourism town in China, based on in-depth interviews. A model framework was also constructed. The results pinpoint subjective interaction intention and objective interaction opportunities as two influencing factors which operate reciprocally and directly influence locals’ and migrants’ daily interactions. The findings suggest that many locals and migrants experience clear communication boundaries in daily interactions. Both groups’ subjective interaction intentions were influenced by their cultural backgrounds, group perceptions, and original social networks, all of which are difficult to modify within a short time. Therefore, increasing objective communication opportunities is a key way to promote intergroup interaction and integration. These findings provide theoretical and practical implications for tourism host communities’ well-being and sustainable development.

T1  - Effect of persuasion via social media on attitude toward elite sport policies
AN  - 2377699164
AB  - We examined the effect of different persuasion interventions in social media (central route vs. peripheral route vs. no persuasion) on attitude toward elite sport policies. We conducted 2 experimental studies with a college student sample (Study I) and a sample drawn from the general public (nonstudent sample, Study II). Results indicated that in the student sample, attitude of the peripheral-route-persuasion group toward elite sport policies was significantly more positive than that of either the no-persuasion group or the central-route-persuasion group. However, results from the nonstudent sample suggested that both the central-route-persuasion and peripheral-route-persuasion groups had more positive attitude toward elite sport policies than did the no-persuasion group. Involvement did not moderate the persuasion-attitude relationship in either the student or nonstudent sample. The findings from this research indicate that a more concise way of communication (peripheral route) is more effective for persuading college students. Government agents may adopt the findings from this research to customize persuasion interventions to influence their target audience effectively.

T1  - The impact of biological and cultural racisms on attitudes towards immigrants and immigration public policies
AN  - 2376776197
AB  - Based on ESS-7 data, this paper focuses on two attitudinal dimensions about public policies related to immigration: how many can come and who can come. In this context, the hypothesis concerning the bi-dimensionality of racism was supported and, as predicted, biological racism is more anti-normative than cultural racism. Both biological and cultural racism predict opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria on the selection of immigrants. As hypothesised, the relationship between racism and opposition to immigration and adhesion to ethnicist criteria is mediated by threat perceptions. Specifically, symbolic and realistic threats mediate the effect of biological and cultural racism on opposition to immigration and on ethnicist criteria. The hypothesis that the mediation effects are moderated by the country’s quality of democracy was supported, indicating that the mediation effects are stronger in countries with a higher quality of democracy. Results are discussed within the context of racism theories as a bi-dimensional concept and in the framework of the role of legitimation processes in social discrimination.

T1  - Parental phubbing accelerates depression in late childhood and adolescence:A two-path model
AN  - 2375825659
AB  - Introduction: Phubbing is a social exclusion behavior related to mobile phone use. It undermines interpersonal relationships and mental health. This study aimed to test the connections between parental phubbing and depression in late childhood and adolescence, as well as the mediating roles of parental warmth, parental rejection, and relatedness need satisfaction. Methods: We conducted two studies. Study 1 was a cross-sectional study of 530 Chinese students (268 boys and 262 girls, Mage = 13.15 ± 0.64 years) who completed self-report questionnaires. We conducted structural modeling to test the relationship between parental phubbing and depression. Study 2 used a short longitudinal design to validate the results of Study 1 and test the mediating roles of parental warmth, parental rejection, and relatedness need satisfaction. In Study 2, we recruited 293 Chinese students (151 boys, 141 girls, and one participant with no reported gender information, M age = 12.87 ± 0.74 years) to complete the questionnaires and applied structural equation modeling to analyze the data. Results: Two sequential mediation effects were found. The first was parental phubbing → parental warmth → relatedness need satisfaction → depression (protection-reduced effect). The second was parental phubbing → parental rejection → relatedness need satisfaction → depression (risk-increased effect). Gender differences were non-significant. Conclusions The study revealed that parental phubbing was associated with students' depression in late childhood and adolescence through two paths. The present study highlights the need to establish family norms regulating mobile phone use to reduce phubbing.

T1  - From social interactions to interpersonal relationships: Influences on ultra-runners’ race experience
AN  - 2320833216
AB  - Objectives 
Ultra-running’s psychological and physiological dimensions have been widely studied. However, the social dimensions of ultra-racing have been largely overlooked. This study aims to identify the different types of social interactions that occur during a multi-day, ultra-race and to understand how these interactions influence ultra-runners’ race experience.
 Methods 
Athletes competing in Britain’s “Spine Race” were recruited for the current study. Twelve male runners aged between 32 and 66 years (M = 50; SD = 10.01) followed the qualitative protocol designed for the study. Specifically, each participant completed a modified version of the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) instrument and underwent a post-race, self-confrontation interview. Participants were asked to recall and reconstruct their memories about their (a) actions (e.g., What did you do when you encountered other people?); (b) thoughts (e.g., What were your thoughts when you encountered other people?) and (c) feelings (e.g., What were your feelings when you encountered other people?).
 Results 
The results show that social interactions and interpersonal relationships are common in ultra-races. Different groups of people play an important role in racers’ motivation and goal achievement: fellow racers, volunteers, medics, friends and family, and even the general public. The resulting social interactions and relationships can occur before, during and after the race in both online and offline environments. These social influences have a powerful influence on the athlete’s race experience.
 Conclusion 
The vast majority of social interactions reported by runners had a positive effect on their race experience and often led to interpersonal relationships. Ultra-runners should be mindful of the impact that social interactions and relationships can have in shaping their race experience.

T1  - Identity, representations, religion, and apologizing for past wrongdoings: Muslim discourse about Indonesia's 1965–66 massacres of communists
AN  - 2314169068
AB  - Since 1965, in Indonesia, people labelled as communists and their descendants have been mistreated. Recently, there has been an issue to apologize to them, but up until now, no official apology has been offered by the Indonesian government. The present study aims to understand how communism is perceived in Indonesia and why communism attributes labelled to a person can lead to negative effects, such as social exclusions. We interviewed 23 Muslims living in Jakarta (i.e., majority group) and used a thematic analysis to organize and describe the data. We found that Muslims who see communists as non‐believers view communist members as dangerous and a threat for the unity of the Republic of Indonesia. Among participants with such beliefs, the past maltreatments to accused communists are justified and legitimate; any apology toward the victims is considered not needed. The findings are discussed in the context of collective blaming and group essentialization, and ways to solve the problems are suggested.

T1  - Islamophobia, Racism and the Vilification of the Muslim Diaspora
AN  - 2410495495
AB  - Is Islamophobia a new phenomenon? Are Islam and the Judeo-Christian West still hateful of and hostile toward each other? Do Muslim women with veils and headscarves constitute a threat to the Wests secular and liberal values? What has fueled the sudden rhetoric of Islamophobia in the United States of America and Europe? How does Anglophone print and digital media report pressures, prejudices and discriminatory practices against male and female students? How do Western media cover the social exclusion of the Muslim diaspora? These questions need a thoughtful coverage and concentration in academia. It is believed that most of the grievous and painful stories experienced, for example, by Muslim immigrants- be they legal or illegal, asylum seekers, refugees, or whatsoever, still do not find a room in scholastic research. This paper utilizes the narrative research method to study and probe into the problem of Islamophobia, the vilification of and racism against Muslims in the United States of America and Europe. The usage of human stories, peoples personal experiences and narrative accounts or recounts of Islamophobic incidents (real or imagined) as the basis of this inquiry is particularly suitable for research because it can help understand the status quo of Muslim diaspora in the United States of America and Europe. Narrative data are retrieved from five major US-news publications and press elite (e.g., Foreign Policy, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and Chicago Tribune). The analysis of these data can be used to improve the situation of Muslim diaspora and their interaction with non-Muslims all over the world. The mediums cited above have been chosen because they are the prime source of information for intellectuals and policy-makers. Decidedly, they construct and build up ample epistemologies on Islamophobia and other epiphenomena of racism.

AB  - The veteran cohort has been inextricably linked in the general public’s mind by media-generated perceptions of high risk and fear of crime, echoed in wider contemporary debates linking issues of place, social identity, social exclusion, and a loss of belonging in wider communities. Despite the growing interest in the longer term outcomes of transition from military to civilian life from policy-makers, practitioners, and academics, few qualitative studies explore the social and relational impacts of this transitional experience on those who have experienced it. Tensions and frustrations expressed by ex-forces personnel, engaging in addiction services with a history of engagement in the criminal justice sector, are explored through the lens of belongingness, loss and related citizenship frameworks to expose temporal impacts on the acquisition, loss, and reformulation of a sense of belonging across the life course. The relevance of a significant loss of belonging in the transition from military to civilian life is useful, given the widely accepted damaging consequences of having this need thwarted. This article concludes that a broader understanding of this largely disenfranchised grief can enable more informed reflexive opportunities to facilitate a valued military veteran citizenship status and thereby contribute to the formulation of current policy debates concerning the veteran question.

T1  - 'People and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense'? Locating the tenant's voice in Homes in High Flats
AN  - 2264100142
AB  - In recent years, the social research of Pearl Jephcott has been subject to scholarly reappraisal on the grounds that it displays an early commitment to the unmediated reporting of 'the authentic voice of her participants'. This article investigates the extent to which this claim holds for Jephcott's seminal 1971 study Homes in High Flats. It suggests that, although Homes in High Flats sought to investigate 'people and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense', the study's ability to realise this aim was complicated by the social distance obtaining between researcher and researched. Based on re-analysis of the study's archived research materials, the article explores how this distance mediated the researchers' interpretation and re-presentation of the tenant's voice, deepening understanding of the epistemological premises of Jephcott's work.

T1  - Evaluating the Short-term Impact of Media Aware Parent, a Web-based Program for Parents with the Goal of Adolescent Sexual Health Promotion
AN  - 2257436141
AB  - Parents can significantly impact their adolescent child’s sexual and relationship decision-making, yet many parents are not effectively communicating with their teens about these topics. Media are sexual socialization agents for adolescents, which can encourage early or risky sexual activity. Media Aware Parent is a web-based program for parents of adolescents that was designed to improve adolescent sexual health by providing parents with the skills to have high-quality communication with their child about sex and relationships as well as to mediate their media usage. This web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018–2019 with parent-child pairs (grades 7, 8, or 9; N = 355) from across the United States. Parent participants identified as mostly female (75%), white/Caucasian (74%); and non-Hispanic (92%). The youth sample was more balanced in terms of gender (45% female) and more diverse with respect to race (66% white) and ethnicity (86% non-Hispanic). Twenty-eight percent of the families identified as a single parent household, and 35% of the youth were eligible for free school lunch. The present study assessed the short-term effects of Media Aware Parent on parent–adolescent communication, adolescent sexual health outcomes, and media-related outcomes across a one-month timeframe. Parents were randomly assigned to the intervention (Media Aware Parent) or active control group (online access to medically-accurate information on adolescent sexual health). The intervention improved parent–adolescent communication quality as rated by both parents and youth. Youth were more likely to understand that their parent did not want them to have sex at this early age. Youth reported more agency over hook-ups, more positive attitudes about sexual health communication and contraception/protection, and more self-efficacy to use contraception/protection, if they decide to have sexual activity. The intervention improved media literacy skills in both parents and youth, and resulted in youth being more aware of family media rules. Parents gave overwhelming positive feedback about Media Aware Parent. The results from this pretest-posttest study provide evidence that Media Aware Parent is an effective web-based program for parents seeking to enhance parent–adolescent communication and media mediation, and positively impact their adolescents’ sexual health outcomes.

T1  - Political appearances: Race and the places of state authority in Metro Vancouver’s Vaisakhi celebrations
TT  - Political appearances
AN  - 2316752703
AB  - PurposeIn Metro Vancouver, Vaisakhi celebrations are organized by local Sikh gurdwaras to mark the Punjabi harvest season and the anniversary of the Sikh Khalsa, which was formed in 1699. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how Vaisakhi celebrations have become mechanisms for state institutions to refigure and extend their racial authority over Sikh places and populations through their coordinated appearances at these public events. These appearances are analyzed to reveal how contemporary racial states are characterized by complex conditions of visibility and public identification that obscure and foreclose the racial conditions of their authority.Design/methodology/approachThe data analyzed for this paper were generated through observational fieldwork at Vaisakhi celebrations and extensive archival and media research on the changing racial governance of Sikh and South Asian populations.FindingsThe results show that, in Metro Vancouver, racial modes of governance have created “post-racial” relations between the state’s public visages of diversity and accessibility and its expanded legal regulation of the social and political places of local Sikh populations.Originality/valueThe concept of political appearances is developed to explain how contemporary racial states reproduce and augment their authority through discursive practices of public engagement with minority populations as well as the specific aesthetic conditions of these engagements. The paper also offers important cautions against state practices that expand the presence of law enforcement within marginalized communities by showing how this enhanced visibility can engender forms of racialization.

T1  - "I Almost Quit": Exploring the Prevalence of the Ferguson Effect in Two Small Sized Law Enforcement Agencies in Rural Southcentral Virginia
AN  - 2268536346
AB  - Recent negatively publicized police-citizen interactions in the media, followed by a subsequent de-policing of police in the United States, has been named the Ferguson Effect. The Ferguson Effect has been explored by prominent scholars in the criminal justice community; however, little is known about how police officers in small rural police agencies perceive the Ferguson Effect. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore the perceptions and lived experiences of police officers regarding the Ferguson Effect in small rural police agencies, as well as police officers' perceptions of their own organizational justice. Organizational justice theory was utilized as the theoretical lens for this study. Research questions focused on exploring police officers' perceptions, attitudes, and experiences of the Ferguson Effect phenomenon and willingness to partner with the community. Purposeful sampling was utilized and semi structured interviews were conducted of nine active sworn law enforcement personnel in southcentral Virginia. Data were analyzed through in vivo coding, pattern coding, and structural analysis utilizing NVivo 11 Pro. Themes included: (a) racial division, (b) rush to judgment, and (c) steadfast leadership. Findings indicated participants demanded clear and fair policies and procedures from leadership, increased effort of transparency in policing, feelings of racial tension, and the need to regain community trust post-Ferguson.

T1  - Socioeconomic Status and the Physical and Mental Health of Arab and Chaldean Americans in Michigan
AN  - 2050193937
AB  - Research that explains health of Arab and Chaldean Americans relative to the health of non-Arab White Americans is limited but steadily increasing. This study considers whether socioeconomic status moderates the relationship between race/ethnicity and physical and mental health. Data come from a state representative sample of Arab and Chaldean Americans—the 2013 Michigan Behavioral Risk Factor Survey and the 2013 Michigan Arab/Chaldean Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (N = 12,837 adults with 536 Arab/Chaldean Americans). Structural equation models examine whether socioeconomic status, operationalized as educational attainment, moderates the relationship between Arab/Chaldean identity and health, and whether physical activity, access to healthcare, and depression mediate the relationship between educational attainment and health. Results indicate that while Arab/Chaldean Americans have poor health relative to non-Arab White Americans, these differences are largely explained by educational differences. Depression, access to healthcare, and physical activity mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and health of Arab/Chaldean Americans.

T1  - Recruitment and Re-Memory: S.E.K. Mqhayi’s ‘<i>Umkosi Wemidaka</i>: The Dark-Skinned Army’ (1916) and Fred Khumalo’s <i>Dancing the Death Drill</i> (2017)
AN  - 2258694240
AB  - The poem by the great isiXhosa poet and imbongi S.E.K. Mqhayi, ‘Umkosi Wemidaka: The Dark-Skinned Army’ (1916), inspired and encouraged Africans to volunteer for the South African Native Labour Contingent (SANLC) in the First World War. Employing techniques of traditional poetry, Mqhayi’s work marks the transition from oral to written literature. By the 1950s, various accounts from the oral tradition, including other poems and news reports by Mqhayi, gave rise to a nationalist mythology on the sinking of the SS Mendi, including an apocryphal speech of the Reverend Isaac Dyobha and a legendary ‘Death Drill’. In 2017, 100 years after the sinking of the troopship SS Mendi in 1917, her political and symbolic legacy continues to inform the national narrative, given the extensive media coverage of the event in 2016/2017 and other acts of commemoration by the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). Fred Khumalo’s recent novel, Dancing the Death Drill (2017), fictionally re-enacts the Mendi story and is informed by precolonial and modern African voices. Using a form of allegorical realism, Khumalo embarks on a process of ‘re-memory’ in shaping the life of a mixed-race protagonist and survivor of the Mendi disaster who emigrates to France, only to face demons from his past. Each work is contextualised and analysed here to reveal how, at different historical junctures, both writers use language to discover places of resistance and thereby reassert black agency and alternative histories. However, Khumalo is more closely integrated into a ‘metropolitan’ culture associated with global trends and seems to have lost much of Mqhayi's imperial allegiance. While the generic indeterminacy of the novel confronts contemporary racial tensions, Mqhayi's panegyric to the men of the Mendi exhibits a robust adherence to traditional form and mode. Khumalo’s choice of a ‘mixed-race’ hero suggests the search for a hybrid cultural identity more aligned with contemporary South African society as it endeavours to move beyond legacies of racism and colonialism.

T1  - Trump's Dispute Resolution Legacy in the Workplace
AN  - 2177062593
AB  - President Donald Trump has a highly unorthodox negotiating style. In this article, Fincher reflects on whether his negotiating style will affect the practice of workplace negotiation and conflict resolution and if so, whether that impact will be temporary or will cause a more permanent shift in how workplace conflict is resolved in the US. Trump's negotiation style is fundamentally based on his real estate practice, the foundation of his career. This style can be viewed as distributive (win-lose) and has multiple elements.

T1  - Religiosity and Attitudes towards Immigrants in Croatia
TT  - Religioznost i stavovi prema imigrantima u Hrvatskoj
AN  - 2272728795
AB  - Migration has become a burning issue of the contemporary world, while immigrants are the "incarnation of outsiders". Although research shows that most Europeans support open Europe, spreading moral panic is one of the more frequent responses to migration. Politicians and the media, especially those on the right and the far right side of the political spectrum, try to represent immigrants as a security problem and every other kind of problem for all, even potential, recipient countries. Xenophobophilia, i.e. the political exploitation of xenophobic tendencies in the general population, is on the rise together with xenophobia, which forms a kind of social perpetuum mobile of the third kind. The public discourse often associates immigrants coming from predominantly Islamic countries with terrorism, as if they were Islamists, thus instilling the fear of mass migration from the Islamic world and of possibly devastating Islamic influence on the Christian cultural foundations of contemporary immigration societies. In this context, the question of whether traditional immigration countries as well as new or potential ones are ready and able to face the contemporary challenges of religion. In essence, the dynamics of the relationship between immigrants and the receiving society and the need for its understanding make the issue of religion, among other factors, both complex and unavoidable in migration research. This connection was mainly observed either from the perspective of the sociology of migration or the sociology of religion, which determined the focus and aspect of linking the two phenomena. Therefore, this paper first offers a brief insight into previous sociological research from both perspectives, and then tries to pose the issue of sociological research of the relationship between religion and migration with a study conducted in Croatia on a representative sample of adult citizens. An insight into theoretical and empirical research of this relationship shows that they are socially and historically determined in many facets. This is obvious in the differences in the topics that sociologists focus on and which arise from the social and historical context within which they are being explored. Contextual differences in multi-national research represent a problem for researchers, confronting them with theoretical limitations and methodological challenges.Alternate abstract:Migracije su postale goruće pitanje suvremenoga svijeta, a imigranti »inkarnacija autsajdera«. Sve učestalije naglašavanje njihove kulturne i pritom dominantno religijske različitosti od većinskoga stanovništva u zemljama primitka poticaj je za istraživanje povezanosti religije i migracija. U radu se na temelju empirijskog istraživanja stavova prema stranim radnicima u Hrvatskoj propituje postoji li povezanost između religioznosti i stavova prema imigrantima te religija kao simbolička granica prema imigrantima. U prvom dijelu rada problematizira se primarno sociološki pristup istraživanju povezanosti religije i imigracije. Potom se iznose i analiziraju rezultati istraživanja provedenoga s pomoću anketnoga upitnika na reprezentativnom uzorku od 1300 punoljetnih hrvatskih građana i građanki. Pritom se dovode u vezu dimenzije religioznosti (religijska samoidentifikacija, konfesionalna samoidentifikacija i religijska praksa), stav prema povezanosti religijskoga i nacionalnog identiteta i izražena društvena distanca prema pripadnicima drugih religija (nekatolicima), kao nezavisne varijable, s izraženim stavovima prema stranim (imigrantskim) radnicima. Pokazalo se da su sve tri istraživane dimenzije religioznosti statistički značajno povezane sa stavovima prema imigrantima, odnosno da su oni religiozniji i koji prakticiraju religiju skloniji izraziti veću društvenu distancu prema imigrantima i imigrante percipirati ponajprije kao kulturnu prijetnju. Također se pokazuje da su društvenu distancu prema imigrantima skloni izraziti oni koji imaju stav da su religijsko i nacionalno usko povezani, a osobito oni koji su skloni izraziti društvenu distancu prema pripadnicima drugih religija (nekatolicima).

T1  - Analysing the dynamics of crisis leadership in higher education: A study of racial incidents at the University of Missouri
AN  - 2130192985
AB  - The following article analyses the crisis involving racial tensions at the University of Missouri in 2015 that ultimately contributed to the departure of the university president and chancellor. This case amplifies the importance of organizational vulnerabilities from both an historical context and a national‐issue context. As supported through this analysis, crises that reflect these vulnerabilities of an organization can lead to increased scrutiny and may produce greater negative consequences. Drawing upon both the public messaging surrounding this crisis and the existing literature on crisis management and crisis leadership, university leaders should have been proactive in cultivating a more inclusive racial environment and should have more effectively used communication to improve relationships with an important constituency group, particularly given the institution's core values, the history of racial tensions at the university, and the rising racial tensions following incidents in nearby Ferguson, Missouri.

T1  - Identity Override: How Sexual Orientation Reduces the Rigidity of Racial Boundaries
AN  - 2131681372
AB  - Although most Americans have limited interpersonal relations with different-race others, interracial ties are notably more common among gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) individuals. Departing from the modal explanation of intergroup relations theories, which suggests that individual propensities for between-group interactions are driven by demographic groups’ physical location relative to one another, we show that, beyond propinquity, GLB interraciality is spiked through active identification as GLB. We evaluate full romantic/sexual partnership histories along with friendship network racial compositions for respondents in a large, nationally representative sample. We show that GLBs have a greater likelihood and frequency than heterosexuals of forming multiple types of interracial ties and also that this effect applies only to those who actively identify as GLB and not to those who engage in same-sex relations but do not identify as GLB. This discovery refines theories of intergroup relations, isolating how identification serves as a mediating mechanism that can heighten the propensity for intergroup interaction. We argue that active identification with a group that crosses racial boundaries spurs overriding the rigidity of intergroup borders that otherwise dissuade interpersonal diversity.

T1  - The politics of Generation Grime
AN  - 2120555348
AB  - In the 2017 UK general election, Grime artists (musicians representing the experience of a young black dispossessed city working class) came out in support of the Labour Party’s radical leader Jeremy Corbyn. The author, drawing on in-depth interviews with Grime experts and leftwing activists and an examination of social media, explains that endorsement in terms of the concept of ‘embedded ethics’ which allows Grime artists to present themselves as authentic social commentators on intersecting forms of poverty, state racism and social exclusion. Using the work of cultural theorists Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, she argues that Grime is more than a music genre and more a way of life giving cultural meaning – explaining the mobilisations for both the election and, later, over the Grenfell fire. But the piece asks whether, at a time of blatant neoliberalism and harsh austerity, there is a need now to insert a more direct discussion of class into the cultural theory debate.

T1  - The threat of increasing diversity: Why many White Americans support Trump in the 2016 presidential election: GPIR
AN  - 2087352971
AB  - What accounts for the widespread support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential race? This experiment demonstrates that the changing racial demographics of America contribute to Trump’s success as a presidential candidate among White Americans whose race/ethnicity is central to their identity. Reminding White Americans high in ethnic identification that non-White racial groups will outnumber Whites in the United States by 2042 caused them to become more concerned about the declining status and influence of White Americans as a group (i.e., experience group status threat), and caused them to report increased support for Trump and anti-immigrant policies, as well as greater opposition to political correctness. Increased group status threat mediated the effects of the racial shift condition on candidate support, anti-immigrant policy support, and opposition to political correctness. Among Whites low in ethnic identification, in contrast, the racial shift condition had no effect on group status threat or support for anti-immigrant policies, but did cause decreased positivity toward Trump and decreased opposition to political correctness. Group status threat did not mediate these effects. Reminders of the changing racial demographics had comparable effects for Democrats and Republicans. Results illustrate the importance of changing racial demographics and White ethnic identification in voter preferences and how social psychological theory can illuminate voter preferences.

T1  - Predictors of Caregiver Communication About Reproductive and Sexual Health and Sensitive Sex Topics
AN  - 2040420589
AB  - Numerous studies examining parent–teen communication about sex (PTCS) have focused on reproductive and sexual health information (i.e., pregnancy, physical development, contraception), with significantly fewer addressing communication about sensitive sex topics (i.e., sexual pleasure, masturbation). This study compares predictors of communication about reproductive and sexual health to those of sensitive sex topics with early adolescents. Participants were 465 rural caregivers and their African American youth. Positive attitudes and self-efficacy for PTCS, open communication style, and older youth age predicted caregiver reports of communication about reproductive and sexual health topics. Open communication style and self-efficacy for PTCS predicted caregiver reports of communication about sensitive sex topics. For youth, only older age and being female predicted communication about reproductive and sexual health, while only being female predicted communication about sensitive sex topics. This study may inform interventions that seek to increase PTCS by highlighting strategies for improving communication about both reproductive and sensitive sex topics.

T1  - Sexism and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Sample of Heterosexuals and Sexual Minorities: the Mediation Effect of Sexual Stigma
AN  - 2023984942
AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

T1  - Social Transformation and Human Mobility: Reflections on the Past, Present and Future of Migration
AN  - 2024042324
AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as 'guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a 'natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the 'guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian 'tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

T1  - Rethinking the Debate Over Recent Polling Failures
AN  - 2015014168
AB  - In Inventing American Religion (2015), sociologist Robert Wuthnow's prescient history and harsh critique of the survey industry, he called for a frank national dialogue "about what is being tapped in polls and whether the investment is worth it." He estimated that more than 1,200 unique firms and institutions had conducted 37,000 separate public opinion polls in the United States through 2012, mostly since the 1990s. According to my count of that same polltracking service Wuthnow cited, an additional 12,000 polls were conducted in the four-year election cycle that followed, concluding in 2016 with Donald Trump's electoral college upset. While the unexpected result prompted some industry flagellation and introspection (e.g., Cohn, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2017; Silver, 2017) a broader dialogue about opinion polls is long overdue. What, if anything, are we actually learning from all these surveys? I argue as others have (e.g., Lepore, 2015; Zukin, 2015) that yes, there is a crisis in public opinion research, but it is not strictly speaking the one that has received most of the attention from scholars and journalists. I am referring of course to hotly contested disputes about the impact of declining response rates, strategies for selecting and modeling representative samples from various panels of Internet respondents, and implications of the rising use of multiple survey modes (for an overview, see Kennedy et al., 2017). These changes may have far-reaching implications. But no, my question for those of us who study public opinion is not about the limits of our methods or our abilities to accurately and reliably forecast elections. Rather, in this article I ask, as Wuthnow does, whether we ought to demand both less and more from the millions spent on survey research each election cycle: we should be less concerned with forecasting errors and more troubled by ingrained practices in the use of surveys that reveal less about public attitudes than they should.

T1  - Investigating the link between school performance, aftercare and educational outcome among youth ageing out of foster care: a Norwegian nationwide longitudinal cohort study
AN  - 2573423157
AB  - Prior research on public interventions targeting youth ageing out of public care (‘aftercare’) and related educational outcome is scarce. The ones that exist indicate that youth receiving aftercare increase their chances of accomplishing higher education and thereby lower risk of social exclusion in later adult life. Yet, little is known about the characteristics of those who receive aftercare measures compared to the ones that enter adulthood without the same support. By using Norwegian nationwide longitudinal administrative data of the total population born 1986–1990 placed in long term foster care, this article provides empirical insight on how foster youths’ resources as reflected by school performance at age 16 is related to the chances of receiving aftercare. Furthermore, it explores to what extent such a selection might mediate the relationship between aftercare service and completion of upper secondary school at age 21. The results show that medium and to some extent high-achievers are more prone to receive aftercare measures from the child welfare system. However, this selection does not explain the positive educational effects of aftercare. Staying in foster care beyond the age of 18 has a strong positive effect on completion of upper secondary school which is not altered when taking selection into account.

T1  - Europeanization or National Specificity? Legal Approaches to Sexual Harassment in France, 2002–2012
AN  - 2007415653
AB  - This paper examines whether-and if so how-a 2002 European Directive on sexual harassment has changed the practice and content of sexual harassment law in France. It finds that the European Directive shaped how French courts address sexual harassment and informed the content of a new sexual harassment law France passed in 2012. Yet, its influence has been mediated by dominant national attitudes about: (1) the nature of sexual harassment, (2) which legal institutions are best suited to address it, and (3) the character of women who claim to have been harassed. This paper further suggests that news reporting on a 2011 arrest of a French politician for sexual assault led to more positive attitudes about sexual harassment victims.

T1  - Rescue US: Birth, Django, and the Violence of Racial Redemption
AN  - 2002773050
AB  - In this article, I show how the relationship between race, violence, and redemption is articulated and visualized through film. By juxtaposing DW Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation and Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained, I contend that the latter inverts the logic of the former. While Birth sacrifices black bodies and explains away anti-black violence for the sake of restoring white sovereignty (or rescuing the nation from threatening forms of blackness), Django adopts a rescue narrative in order to show the excessive violence that structured slavery and the emergence of the nation-state. As an immanent break within the rescue narrative, Tarantino’s film works to “rescue” images and sounds of anguish from forgetful versions of history.

T1  - The devil is not in the detail: representational absence and stereotyping in the 'Trojan Horse' news story
AN  - 1952104196
AB  - Using content analysis, this study investigated the coverage of the Trojan Horse news story aiming to ascertain whether its representation by the British press emphasized 'Islamist extremism' over 'poor school governance'. The sample coverage was extracted from five national newspapers and ranged from 9 June (the date of release of the Ofsted Advice Note) to 26 June 2014. Our analysis shows that the coverage reported evidence of Islamist ideology much more frequently (61.5%) than evidence of poor governance (38.5%). This suggests that the Trojan Horse news story was predominantly represented as a case of Islamist extremism and therefore covered in an unbalanced manner. Such a partial coverage relied on ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes to represent Islam and Muslims, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (governors' professional misconduct). This bias has arguably diverted attention away from systemic problems within the national school system whilst reinforcing Islamophobic discourses.

AN  - 1981732685
AB  - In this study, we examined the relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards professional mental health services. We further examined whether internal religious coping and external religious coping mediated both relationships. Results indicated a significant association with religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services, as well as external religious coping and internal religious coping. Results also showed a nonsignificant association with both religious coping and negative attitudes towards mental health services. Finally, external religious coping mediated the relationship between religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services for men but not for women.

T1  - Uncovering the Double-Edged Sword of Inter-Organisational Networks of Welfare Services: Tackling Wicked Issues in Social Work
AN  - 2196659167
AB  - This article deals with the tendency within the field of social work practice to create inter-organisational networks for welfare provision. We highlight the opportunities that then arise for social work to tackle social exclusion, and to perform its mediating role between the public sphere of government and the private sphere of individuals and families. We argue that the advantages of inter-organisational networking and collaboration can be realised by overcoming fragmentation of care at the micro level of welfare provision to citizens, but also by using these networks as a forum for debate to challenge dominant conceptualisations of complex social problems across organisational and sectorial boundaries. However, we also point to the danger of a so-called ‘network euphoria’, and discuss some of the risks associated with working together through networks. Therefore, the central argument of the article implies that those involved in these networks need to develop a common framework, or value base, with reference to human rights and principles of social justice.

T1  - A Comparative Study of Requests amongst Second Language Speakers of English
AN  - 1872507096
AB  - This paper sought to investigate the consequences of discovering that children have disabilities and their implications for parenting. The study upon which the paper has been based took the form of a literature review. There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that parents tend to blame themselves upon discovering that a child of theirs has a disability. Some parents experience great difficulty in obtaining medical or educational information to assist them to deal with the disabilities of their children. In addition, the children themselves are often subjected to mistreatment as a result of their ignorance, particularly as a result of having little or no knowledge or understanding of sexuality. Disabled children are also often subjected to being excluded from inalienable human rights such as having access to an acceptable quality of education. In the light of the challenges which they face in these respects, it is recommended that there should be a concerted and a committed endeavour to maximise public awareness and education through the printed, audio and visual media, in order to bring an end to the stigma and the additional challenges, such as social exclusion, which often accompany disabilities for children, by promoting and monitoring inclusive systems for communities and all institutions which are dedicated to meeting the needs of children, including schools.

T1  - "Papa, Am I a Negro?" The Vexed History of the Racial Epithet in Norwegian Print Media (1970-2014)
AN  - 1816297573
AB  - This study explores the portrayal of blacks in Norwegian print media between 1970 and 2014 as refracted through the prism of the epithet "Negro" (neger). 4174 references covering 30 newspapers are analyzed employing a Critical Race Theory conceptual framework where the tenets of "racism as normal," the principle of interest convergence, and subversive storytelling are salient. The findings reveal, contra some claims that "Negro" has been employed as a "neutral" biological descriptor in Norway, that the epithet verbally incarcerates blacks in a web of racist stereotypes that tap into topoi of blacks as either the eschewed or exotically essentialized "Other."

T1  - Policing in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia: understanding the role of sectarian history and politics
AN  - 1801899387
AB  - This article examines the historical and political legacy of police-Shi'a relations in the Eastern Province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Shi'a form a significant minority population in the Kingdom. The group is oppressed socially, politically and economically by the Sunni, Wahhabi ruling class of the Kingdom, and this has shaped Saudi Arabian police strategies and tactics. Shi'a are nearly unrepresented among the leadership, rank and file of the national police, which have investigated many serious crimes allegedly attributed to members of this population, including numerous terrorist attacks since the 1990s. Using a variety of sources, as well as media accounts, this article is a case study, arguing from a critical perspective that understanding Sunni-Shi'a sectarian politics is fundamental to ascertaining the nature of the relationship between the public and the police in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. This article emphasises that cultural notions of order and order maintenance, which involve Shi'a social exclusion, significantly factor into how the Saudi police are deployed. Further, understanding policing in persistent authoritarian contexts such as Saudi Arabia is important for grasping the full landscape of policing as it operates worldwide.

T1  - The Impact of Class and Sexuality-Based Stereotyping on Rape Blame
AN  - 2314220975
AB  - In order to investigate whether stereotypes about sexuality can impact perceptions of sexual assault, participants read a scenario that described a situation in which a woman reported being raped. The woman’s socioeconomic status (SES) was varied, so that she appeared to be of low or high-SES. Following the vignette, participants completed explicit measures that assessed victim blame, attitudes toward rape victims, and perceived promiscuity. Participants also answered an open-ended question that was coded for minimizing and maximizing language. Last, participants completed an “attitude survey” that measured classist attitudes. It was hypothesized that participants who read about the low-SES woman would show more rape blame, display more negative attitudes about rape victims, respond to the open-ended question with more minimizing language, and perceive her as being more promiscuous. It was also predicted that these explicit measures would be positively correlated and that the language measure would be moderated by participants’ classism. Results supported these hypotheses. Participants who read about the low-SES survivor showed more negative attitudes, believed her to be more culpable, and more promiscuous. The explicit measures were positively correlated. Additionally, participants differed in linguistic minimization and maximization, such that participants who were low in classism were more likely to maximize the low-SES target’s experience, whereas participants who were high in classism were more likely to minimize the low-SES target’s experience. Taken together, these results suggest that low-SES women are stereotyped as being promiscuous and that this stereotype affects how they may be blamed after cases of sexual assault. Public Health Significance Statement: The results of this study suggest that low-socioeconomic status (SES) survivors of assault are more likely to be blamed and found culpable for the assault than high-SES women. These attitudes correlate with stereotypes about low-SES women’s sexuality.

T1  - Derogating obese individuals: the role of blame, contempt, and disgust
AN  - 1781480863
AB  - Weight stigma is pervasive and has profound negative consequences for obese individuals. The attribution-emotion approach of stigmatization holds that blame attributions relate to derogation stigmatized groups indirectly through anger and pity. Other research suggests that disgust is related to weight stigma. In the present studies, we investigate whether contempt is a reliable predictor of biases against obese individuals. Study 1 (N=297) shows that contempt partially mediates the relation between blame and both prejudice and support for weight related discrimination policies. Studies 2 and 3 (total N=406) added disgust and show that both contempt and disgust relate to social distance and prejudice. Contempt mediated the relation between blame and negative reactions toward obese individuals, even after controlling for other emotions, while disgust only mediated these relations in Study 2. Anger and pity did not show this mediating role, but pity was moderately associated with weight bias. Contempt is likely to play an important role in how people react to members of this stigmatized group.

T1  - The majority influence on interminority attitudes: The secondary transfer effect of positive and negative contact
AN  - 1761733810
AB  - Among minority members, positive contact with the majority was previously found to improve not only the attitudes toward the majority but also the attitudes toward minority outgroups (the secondary transfer effect; STE). However, the roles of negative intergroup contact and minority groups' social status in the STE have not been yet examined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association between both positive and negative contact with the national majority group (Finns) and mutual attitudes among high-status Estonian (n = 171) and low-status Russian (n = 180) immigrants in Finland. Two mediators of the STE were tested: attitudes toward the majority (attitude generalization) and public collective self-esteem (diagonal hostility). While positive and negative STEs emerging via attitude generalization were expected to occur among both immigrant groups, the mediating effect of public collective self-esteem was assumed only for members of the low-status group. In both immigrant groups, the relationship between positive contact with the majority group and attitudes toward the other immigrant group was positive and indirect through more favorable attitudes toward majority group members. The same mechanism characterized negative contact, where the indirect effect was mediated by less positive attitudes toward Finns. As predicted, public collective self-esteem mediated the effects of positive and negative contact with majority group members on attitudes toward the other minority only among low-status Russian immigrants. The results call for the acknowledgement of different mechanisms explaining the STE among minority groups enjoying different social statuses in host society.

T1  - The Representation of Youth in the Dutch News Media
AN  - 1824566117
AB  - Research in social psychology shows that looking into the nuances in stereotyping is of vital importance due to unique emotional and behavioural reactions the different clusters of stereotypical representations may evoke. Media analysts, however, rarely apply a framework that would allow a systematic deconstruction of stereotypes conveyed in the media productions. In the current study, the Dutch news media representation of native and non-native youth is analyzed and compared. The results show considerable differences in news media portrayal of the two groups not only in the amount of (negative) attention they attract but, especially, in the content of their descriptions. While native youth is more frequently evaluated with reference to competence, non-native youth is more readily evaluated with respect to benevolence. The results of the study and the social consequences of Dutch news media representations of younger citizens are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of 'othering'.

AB  - Relying on survey data collected from over 1,300 students of 13-18 years old across multiple US cities, this study attempts to integrate race into social bond theory to explain the variation in juvenile perceptions of the police. Results indicate significant differential outlooks between white and black teenagers, and to a lesser extent, between white and Hispanic juveniles. Social bonds, especially commitment to school and conventional beliefs, have significant effects on juveniles' attitudes. The effects of race and social bonds are more independent and social bonds do not mediate the race-attitudes relationship. Other factors, such as juvenile delinquency, victimization, and sense of safety, are also related to juvenile assessments of the police. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - How similar, how different? On Dutch media depictions of older and younger people
AN  - 1700676680; 201527602
AB  - By providing information on society at large, the media help to establish and maintain relations between various social groups, such as between younger and older people. They may also disturb the formation or maintenance of such relations, e.g. by stimulating the 'othering' of the out-group members. The aim of the present study was to trace how the different strategies of 'othering' are applied by Dutch news media in their portrayal of older and younger citizens. The analysis showed that the most notable discrepancies in the media coverage of the two age groups appear in (the nature of) their evaluation. While the negative descriptors of older characters relate more frequently to their (alleged) incompetence, the negative depictions of younger actors refer predominantly to their lack of benevolence. In the case of positive evaluations the reverse is true: older characters are more often presented as warm and younger people as competent. The results of the study are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of 'othering'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Hate Crimes Against American Indians and Alaskan Natives
AN  - 1684423612; 201520377
AB  - Crimes against American Indians and Alaskan Natives receive little, if any, mainstream media coverage and there is even less attention to hate crimes committed against each population. In light of this neglect, the following research seeks to answer two questions: what types of hate crimes are committed against American Indians and Alaskan Natives and do tribal law enforcement agencies define hate crimes against American Indians and Alaskan Natives as a serious problem? After surveying over 200 tribal law enforcement agencies within the United States, results suggest active discrimination and prejudice toward American Indians and Alaskan Natives, and mixed responses by tribal law enforcement personnel regarding the perceived seriousness of hate crimes.

T1  - Religious Affiliation and Attitudes Towards Gay Men: On the Mediating Role of Masculinity Threat
AN  - 1544524207
AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians.

T1  - Attitudes towards English in Norway: A corpus-based study of attitudinal expressions in newspaper discourse
AN  - 1680154508; 201515345
AB  - This article explores some dimensions of how the role of the English language in Norway has been discursively constructed in newspapers during recent years, based on the analysis of data from the five-year period 2008-2012. The analysis is conducted using a specialised corpus containing 3,743 newspaper articles which were subjected to corpus-based macro-analyses and techniques, as well as manual micro-level analyses and categorisation. The main focus of the analysis is on the manifestation of attitudes through various ways of expression, such as the occurrence of lexical sequences and conceptual metaphors related to language. The results show that even though positive perceptions of English were quite frequent in the data, the main part consisted of expressions where English is seen in a negative light. Hence, a fairly negative attitude towards the role of English is predominant, as illustrated by the most frequent conceptual metaphor, LANGUAGE IS AN INVADING FORCE, where English is at war with and seen as representing a threat to the Norwegian language.

T1  - 'Urban Safaris': Looting, Consumption and Exclusion in London 2011
AN  - 1926267038
AB  - This paper examines the prevalence and relevance of looting for understanding the 2011 English riots. It begins by distinguishing these riots from previous British riots by arguing that although looting is by no means a new phenomena looting nevertheless became central to discussions, interpretations and recollections of the riots. The paper will explore public and media responses to the looting and will focus on the uses of looting as a means of identifying a feral underclass of people seen to be morally and culturally separate from mainstream society. By unpicking the relationships between looting and what currently stands for 'consumer culture', the paper will argue that looting is seen as the lowest common denominator of mob behaviour since its focus is deemed to be entirely apolitical. The paper will look towards current understandings of consumer culture to try to make sense of the looting. It will argue that whilst there is now a good deal of literature exploring the relationships between judgments of taste and the reproduction of existing class structures and barriers, there is virtually nothing examining the relationships between consumption and social exclusion. 
I will argue in this paper that exclusion is crucial in providing a comprehensive understanding of the looting. In particular, I suggest that Bourdieusian accounts of the effects of popular expressions of disgust at the looters can offer only a partial understanding of the looting, since they do not explain the strength of desire for consumer goods. In order to address this, the paper expands on cultural capital discourses by incorporating the concept of 'emotional capital' into the analysis. The paper concludes by arguing that we should not be surprised by the widespread looting that took place in August 2011 given that advanced consumer society is characterised by common feelings and emotions and that many of the looters were not part of the original riots but opportunists who took advantage of the lack of police presence.

T1  - 'Honk Against Homophobia': Rethinking Relations Between Media and Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1504423546; 201405549
AB  - The theory of 'symbolic annihilation' or 'symbolic violence' has been used in academic literature to describe the way in which sexual minorities have been ignored, trivialized, or condemned by the media. This article aims to de-center research from issues of media representation to consider the capacity for minority groups to proactively use new media and its various avenues for interactivity, social networking, and feedback to fight social exclusion. This work suggests that new media has become a space in which the nominally marginal in society may acquire 'social artillery'-a term used to describe how sexual minorities utilize their expanding and more readily accessible social connections in digital space to combat instances of homophobia. The research draws on the results of an inquiry into the relation between media and a regional youth social justice group in Australia tackling homophobia. The research demonstrates that the group is becoming increasingly adept and comfortable with using a cross-section of media platforms to fulfill their own objectives, rather than seeing themselves as passive subjects of media representation. This article argues that this sets an example for other socially excluded groups looking to renegotiate their relation with the media in regional areas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moral Panics and Morality Policy: The Impact of Media, Political Ideology, Drug Use, and Manufacturing on Methamphetamine Legislation in the United States
AN  - 1450252671
AB  - The US recently focused on the methamphetamine epidemic, but little research has examined policies resulting from this increased attention. This study explores influences of state-level methamphetamine legislation during 2000-2007, with the goals of understanding themes of legislative responses, and assessing political, social, and media-related predictors on legislation. Nine themes of methamphetamine legislation were identified through a legal database: pharmacy precursor regulations, precursor sentencing, manufacturing/trafficking, possession, research/task force, prevention or treatment, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, and child protection. Logistic regression results largely support the moral panic literature by finding media's influence and methamphetamine manufacturing on legislation. Findings also suggest that, law enforcement agencies participate in constructing the drug problem, which then drives legislation. Moreover, the drug problem is defined in terms of methamphetamine manufacturing rather than use and treatment, which are largely nonsignificant. Surprisingly, conservative political ideology predicted decreased legislation, suggesting that liberal candidates also raise concerns over methamphetamine.

T1  - The Tulsa Riot of 1921: Collective Violence and Racial Frames
AN  - 1434860844
AB  - This research extends the concept of racial frames to study interracial violence. We contend that episodes characterized by such violence experience the phenomena of framing. More specifically, our research considers the subjective interpretations associated with the perceived causative factors of interracial violence. Our research suggests that the racial groups which participate in the violence attribute its roots in very different ways and that these assessments draw upon systemic racial frames. However, we also argue that media and official frames draw upon the white racial frame which legitimizes the subordination and oppression of African Americans. This frame has a positional hegemonic status, as is evidenced by the outcomes of interracial violence, which often systemically privilege whites. We explore these issues through a study of a riot in Tulsa, Oklahoma 1921. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Effects of Stigmatization on Gay Men Living with HIV/AIDS in a Central-Eastern European Context: A Qualitative Analysis from Hungary
AN  - 1429624026; 201338112
AB  - This qualitative study highlights the social dynamics affecting people living with HIV (PLH) in Hungary and in the Central-Eastern European region. The study focused on the special needs and concerns of men living with HIV/AIDS as well as changes in their social relationships and institutional support provision, coping strategies, and patterns of social functioning, especially in the context of social stigmatization. Consistent with international qualitative research findings in the field of HIV/AIDS prevention, the present study contributes to a fuller understanding of relationship between sexual behavior, HIV/AIDS-related risks and risk perceptions as well as homosexuality- and HIV/AIDS stigma-related social exclusion in a previously under-researched socio-cultural setting. The findings of our study point to several barriers to effective HIV prevention, which should be overcome to improve the present situation by lessening the adverse effects of HIV/AIDS- and homosexuality-related stigma within the gay community, the general population and especially among service providers. One of the main barriers is the lack of public health programs specifically targeting MSM in Hungary, where the predominant mode of HIV transmission remains sex between men.

T1  - Flora Comes's Postcolonial Engagement and Redefinition of Amilcar Cabral's Politics of National Culture in Nha Fala
AN  - 1347786133; 201320548
AB  - This article looks at the politics of culture in modern Guinea-Bissau in the film Nha Fala/My Voice (2002) and, in particular, Flora Gomes's reinterpretation of the country's traditional understanding of national culture and engagement with oral tradition as a form of questioning instability, political unrest, disunity, and dissenting voices. It argues that it is impossible to examine Gomes's representation of Guinea-Bissau's national culture without an understanding of how these issues relate to Amilcar Cabral -- the hero and mentor of the country's independence to whom he dedicates the film -- and his take on the intricate conceptual relationship between 'nation' and 'culture', hence national culture, It then examines Gomes's redefinition of the postcolonial space through engagement with Cabral, in terms of his ideology of the nation and demand for a 'return to the source'. Thirdly, it looks at silence and allegorical dimensions in Nha Fala, critically examining Guinea-Bissau's insecurity, its confrontation of border issues and move away from the traditional pattern of colonial heritage by embracing a wider political arena in Africa. Within silence or mutism, it looks at the cultural, political, and monetary role of France as the new and invisible force which manages the country's economy whilst wrestling Guinea-Bissau away from its Portuguese heritage. It contends that Comes appropriates existing oral tradition to interrogate social exclusion, unemployment, lack of education and accountability, in order to preserve societal equilibrium, by claiming Cabral's rightful place in modern Guinea-Bissau.

T1  - A Corresponding Fields Model for the Links Between Social and Digital Exclusion
AN  - 1347781449; 201320991
AB  - The notion of digital exclusion has become important in communications research but remains undertheorized. This article proposes a theoretical model that hypothesizes how specific areas of digital and social exclusion influence each other. In this corresponding fields model, it is argued that they relate mostly for similar (economic, cultural, social, personal) fields of resources. The model further proposes that the influence of offline exclusion fields on digital exclusion fields is mediated by access, skills, and attitudinal or motivational aspects. On the other hand, the relevance, quality, ownership, and sustainability of engagement with different digital resources is said to mediate the influence of engagement on offline exclusion. Research supporting this model and possible operationalizations in empirical research and interventions are presented. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Stranger Effect: The Rejection of Affective Deviants
AN  - 1364701213; 201323238
AB  - What happens when affective displays deviate from normative expectations? In this study, participants evaluated target individuals displaying flat, incongruent, or congruent expressions seemingly in response to pictures eliciting positive, neutral, or negative affect. Relative to targets who displayed normative reactions, those who violated affective norms (affective deviants) were rated more negatively on various dimensions of social judgment. Participants also preferred greater social distance from affective deviants, reported more moral outrage in response to them, and inferred that these targets did not share their moral values. Incongruent affect resulted in more negative social judgment than did flat affect, and this relationship was moderated by stimulus valence. Finally, the relationship between targets' affective expressions and participants' avoidant intentions was mediated by the extent to which participants thought the targets shared their moral values. These findings demonstrate the interpersonal costs of affective deviance, revealing the pervasiveness and force of affective norms. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The City Is Ours': The Temporal Construction of Dominance among Poor Young Men on the Street in a Brazilian Elite Neighbourhood
AN  - 1141912402
AB  - Abstract              This article explores how young Brazilian men from poorer areas transcend socio-geographical boundaries by inhabiting the streets of an elite neighbourhood. Drawing on several periods of qualitative fieldwork, the article demonstrates the complex and dynamic character of the relationship between the young men and the formal residents and traders. It reveals temporal patterns of day and night, where the young men's social positions shift from subordinate diurnal (as serving workers) to dominant nocturnal positions (as potential attackers). Analysing the interactional patterns between the two groups regarding sentiments of trust and fear, the multifaceted and sometimes incoherent relations reveal social inclusion and exclusion as well as street protection and crime. The article also dismantles some common dichotomies within research on crime and fear of crime, emphasising that these young men are both victims and offenders, fearful and fearsome.

T1  - Host Culture Adoption or Intercultural Contact? Comparing different acculturation conceptualizations and their effects on host members' attitudes towards immigrants
AN  - 1266143578; 201300602
AB  - The effects of the two dimensions underlying immigrants' perceived acculturation strategies conceptualized respectively as Intercultural Contact or as host Culture Adoption were examined. Host members' attitudes and perceptions of immigrants' adjustment to the host society were assessed in two experimental studies (N = 251; N = 124). Participants were presented with a fictitious interview with an African immigrant whose generational Status, desire for Culture Maintenance and Intercultural Contact (Study 1) or host Culture Adoption (Study 2) were manipulated (2 x 2 x 2 design). Results showed that both perceived desire for contact and for culture adoption positively affected host members' attitudes, and that the culture adoption-attitudes relationship was partially mediated by perceived threat. These effects were stronger than those attributable to perceived Culture Maintenance. The latter variable moderated the Desire for Contact but not the Desire for Culture Adoption main effect. Moreover, Contact and Culture Adoption and generational Status all influenced the way in which host members perceived immigrants' socio cultural adjustment. We conclude that more similarities than differences exist between the Contact and the Culture Adoption frameworks, at least in terms of their effects on majority attitudes towards immigrants.

T1  - The friend, the loner and the independent traveller: Norwegian midlife single women's social identities when on holiday/La amiga, la solitaria y la viajera independiente: las identidades sociales de las mujeres noruegas de mediana edad cuando están de vacaciones
AN  - 914931885
AB  - This article explores the social identities available to Norwegian midlife single women when on holiday. As inherent in their habitus, the social identity of a friend is a way of tackling tourism spaces that accommodate bonding. With friends women feel socially included as tourists and seldom disempowered by the surveillance of the tourist gaze. However, the sustenance of friendships is also about discerning what matters; bonding in holiday spaces contributes to maintaining interpersonal relationships in everyday life. Nevertheless, this social identity also requires that women disidentify with being midlife singles, a strategy which is sometimes problematic. The social identity of the loner is linked to fears of solo holidays. This fear is associated with social exclusion, especially when eating out alone in a resort of an evening. In such spaces women dislike being midlife singles; they feel somehow suppressed by the tourist gaze and become aware of their lack of bonding. The social identity of the independent traveller, however, is about enjoyable solo holidays. It is their way of resisting, contesting and negotiating tourism as about sociability with significant others, thereby transforming habitus and manoeuvring the tourist gaze in public holiday spaces, such as restaurants. It is additionally about positive identification with being a midlife single woman. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The politics of place(ment): Problematising the provision of hepatitis C treatment within opiate substitution clinics
AN  - 916984512
AB  - The hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemic is a significant public health challenge in Australia. Current initiatives to expand access to HCV treatment focus on opiate substitution therapy (OST) settings where the prevalence of hepatitis C among clients is high. In Australia, the provision of OST for many clients is via large clinics, with an estimated median of 150 clients per service. Conceptually informed by the work of Michel Foucault, our analysis of the proposed integrated treatment model focuses on the critical but overlooked question of organisational culture and power operating within OST. We argue that the specific context of OST not merely reflects but actively participates in the political economy of social exclusion via which the socio-spatial segregation and stigmatisation of the service user as 'drug user' is enacted. This paper analyses data collected from two samples during 2008/9: OST clients living in New South Wales, Australia and a range of OST health professionals working in Australian settings. In total, 27 interviews were conducted with current OST clients; 19 by phone and 8 face-to-face. One focus group and 16 telephone interviews were conducted with OST health professionals. Our analysis of key themes emerging from the interview data suggests that the successful introduction of HCV treatment within the OST clinic is not a given. We are concerned that particular areas of tension, if not explicit contradiction, have been overlooked in current research and debates informing the proposed combination treatment model. We question the appropriateness of co-locating a notoriously arduous, exacting treatment (HCV) within the highly surveillant and regulatory environment of OST. While applauding the intention to improve access to HCV care and treatment for people who inject drugs we caution against a treatment model that risks further entrenching (socio-spatial) stigmatisation amongst those already experiencing significant marginalisation.

T1  - Strangers and Strangership
AN  - 1364700340; 201322916
AB  - Over a century ago, German sociologist Georg Simmel observed that the figure of the stranger is characterised by a peculiar mixture of physical proximity and social distance. In both social science and popular media, the stranger tends to be treated as equivalent to the immigrant or the unknown Other. This paper takes some of the ideas that the stranger concept generates and pushes them outwards by using Simmel's observation as a springboard to develop the relational concept of strangership. Where the study of strangers focuses on the specific traits of individuals and groups, the concept of strangership focuses instead on the characteristics of relationships between strangers. Three conditions for the emergence and/or presence of strangership are described. In the spirit of contemporary theoretical work that seeks to connect the special position of the stranger to inequality, the paper concludes by proposing the concept of strangership as a way to foreground the relational character of life lived amongst strangers in ways that can thicken how we think about both solidarity and inequality.

T1  - How intergroup friendship works: A longitudinal study of friendship effects on outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1018342788; 201212797
AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE TRACT INFECTIONS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN LAO PDR: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
AN  - 857656859; 21211093
AB  - Summary              Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly  understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Family Stories: Black/White Marriage During the 1960s
AN  - 1018071261
AB  - Black/White romance has become increasingly commonplace in the United States in recent years. Primetime television shows and movies frequently present as unremarkable the love affairs between Black men and White women and between Black women and White men. Americans have become accustomed to vicariously experience Black/White interracial intimacy through celebrity liaisons. Polls tell us that Americans are becoming less opposed to interracial dating and marriage than in previous decades (National Opinion Research Center, 2002; Pew Research Center, 2003). Why has interracial love become more accepted in recent years, and, more importantly, why is Black/White interracial sexual intimacy often cast as ordinary at this moment in American life? Just 50 years ago, a Black man in the South risked his life if suspected by Whites of looking the wrong way at a White woman. A White woman faced rejection by her family and disgrace in the eyes of White society for having a child by a Black father. In 1967, when the Supreme Court struck down anti-miscegenation laws, Black/White marriage was still illegal in 17 states (Kennedy, 2000:144). [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Exploring the representation of orality: the use of vocatives in two Spanish-speaking films, Machuca and Volver
AN  - 1221407806; 201245381
AB  - This paper investigates how vocatives are exploited in the fictional language of two Spanish speaking films: 'Machuca', a Chilean film (2004) and 'Volver', a Spanish film (2006). The aim of this paper is to determine the manner in which the use of vocatives in these films mirrors the functions that they have in naturally occurring data and how they are exploited in order to enhance the representation of orality in the fictional dialogues. Vocatives are considered to be one of the distinctive features of natural speech (Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad and Finegan, 1999; Leech, 1999; McCarthy and O'Keeffe, 2003). The presence of vocatives in films and in similar fictional texts appears to be a contributory factor in the establishment of the social markers of the interactions in which the characters of the film engage, signalling levels of social distance, as well as levels of power and solidarity that the viewing audiences can recognise. Previous research has shown that the use of vocatives, although apparently non-essential for the achievement of particular communicative goals, serves an important social role in a communicative interaction, projecting the level of intimacy established between the participants (McCarthy and O'Keeffe, 2003). The importance of understanding pragmatic variation will be highlighted by comparing the use of vocatives in the two different cultural and linguistic settings represented in the films.

T1  - Introduction: Cultural capital -- Histories, limits, prospects
AN  - 1023026681; 201224957
AB  - Where does the concept of cultural capital stand regarding the histories of its creation, uses, debates and the revisions these have provoked? What are its limits? Which are the key aspects holding the best prospects for future research, or most in need of reformation? These are our concerns outlined in this paper setting out the context for our discussion of the seven papers assembled in this special issue. We first set out the concept of cultural capital in Bourdieu's work noting that it was originally shaped pragmatically in critical interventions into education and cultural policies. We then highlight aspects of the career of the concept of cultural capital in relation to empirical studies of cultural consumption noting some key qualifications and limitations. Limits and prospects are discussed vis-a-vis the papers assembled, under three headings: (1) cultural capital and the logics of capitalism; (2) cultural capital, education and cultural policy, and 'social exclusion'; and (3) aesthetics and the relationality of the social. In concluding, we note the continuing operation of cultural capital as a mechanism for the reproduction of class advantages pointing to the need to consider further the manners in which it engages elites, uses of new media and hierarchies based on gender and ethnicity.

T1  - Fear of Flying
AN  - 862596600; 201110683
AB  - The mining boom is making its mark on a number of regional centres in rural South Australia by bringing in a new population of people associated with this growth. A number of these centres have significant populations of Aboriginal people, who include the traditional owners. A recent ABC Radio National program 360 aired on 13/09/09 focussed on one such place, Port Augusta, and was entitled 'Port Augusta re-imagines'. The program presented descriptions of the Aboriginal cultural landscape, including the significance of the Dreaming stories for this country at the top of Spencer Gulf. Does this imagining, and nourishment of the sensitivity to the landscape and the mysteries of existence, help centre the newcomer to these places and awaken a new Antipodeans' re-imagining or continue the fear of the frontier and Indigenous worldviews? The outcome of the effects to this re-location has importance for the social determinants of health, in particular that of social exclusion experienced by most Indigenous Australians and the associated issues of stress, unemployment, poor housing and so on. This paper draws upon a cultural studies and postcolonial theory base to examine the social determinants of health and possible implications for workforce development in places such as Port Augusta.

T1  - Nordisti contro Sudisti: Internal Migration and Racism in Turin, Italy: 1950s and 1960s
AN  - 2563180610
AB  - The article focuses on the hostility against southerner immigrants in the public sphere in Turin during the internal migrations of the 1950s and 1960s. It reconstructs how the themes and images developed during one hundred years of the questione meridionale provided the repertoire to debate and understand internal migrations. Old stereotypes and prejudices — the south as a homogenous and static entity and southerners as indigent, violent, and uncivilized — were reproduced and reshaped within the historical conjunctures of the 1950s in order define identity, belonging, and alterity. Analyzing newspaper articles and readers' letters, I contend that “gli immigrati meridionali” were identified as the ultimate “other” by their northerners fellow citizens; to be a southerner meant to be economically poor, culturally deprived, and inferior.I will argue that this set of representations, based on the naturalization of culture and stereotypes, belong to a specific form of racism that emerges historically in the north–south relation.The topicality of these issues is evident to anyone familiar with current political and cultural trends in Italy. To understand contemporary anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as anti-southerner sentiments and the permanence of several conflicts along the north–south divide, we have to look at internal migration and at the ways in which southerner workers were constructed, stigmatized, and excluded in northern cities.

T1  - Managing the Parameters of Visibility: The Revelations of Katrina
AN  - 1928842928
AB  - Hurricane Katrina exposed the immobility of the Black poor, revealing the dual logics of concealment and containment on which public space throughout US cities is increasingly built. However, the force of the hurricane eroded the distinction between the private 'ghetto' and the public arena. The response of government and the media was guided by an interpretive framework in which poor urban Blacks are marked by their 'criminality'. It was through this, alongside the dominant colour-blind racial ideology, that the 'revelations' of Katrina, its knowledge or 'truths', were produced and managed. Finally, the rebuilding of New Orleans will be considered, demonstrating how the Black urban poor are excluded from the imaginary of the remodelled contemporary American city.

T1  - SPEAKING RACE/HEARING RACISM
AN  - 762224781
AB  - Prior to Barack Obama declaring his intention to seek the presidency of the United States, Harry Reid, in apparent support of Obama's aspirations, claimed that Obama could win because he was a "light-skinned African American with no Negro dialect unless he wanted one" (Halperin & Heilemann, 2010:38). When this statement became public in the 2010 book Game Change, a political and media-driven firestorm erupted. Reid's words were debated in major news outlets, and his political friends and adversaries chimed in to either castigate or support him. Utilizing a thematic analysis of linguistic interpretations, this research explores the ways public language frames, obscures, and manipulates the realities of race and racism in this country.

This large-scale disease provides a realistic context for investigating the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes. The main aim of this cross-sectional study (N = 412) was to explore mechanisms through which perceived chronic and contextual disease threats operate on immigration attitudes. Structural equation models show that the relationship between chronic disease threat (germ aversion) and exclusionary immigration attitudes (assimilationist immigration criteria, health-based immigration criteria and desire to reduce the proportion of foreigners) was mediated by ideological and normative beliefs (social dominance orientation, belief in a dangerous world), but not by contextual disease threat (appraisal of avian influenza pandemic threat). Contextual disease threat only predicted support for health-based immigration criteria. The conditions under which real-life disease threats influence intergroup attitudes are scrutinized. Convergence and dissimilarity of evolutionary and social representational approaches in accounting for the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes are discussed.
