T1  - Personality traits are directly associated with anti-black prejudice in the United States
AN  - 2419349205
AB  - Modern psychological theories postulate that individual differences in prejudice are determined by social and ideological attitudes instead of personality. For example, the dual-process motivational (DPM) model argues that personality does not directly associate with prejudice when controlling for the attitudinal variables that capture the authoritarian-conservatism motivation and the dominance motivation. Previous studies testing the DPM model largely relied on convenience samples and/or European samples, and have produced inconsistent results. Here we examined the extent to which anti-black prejudice was associated with the Big Five personality traits and social and ideological attitudes (authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, political party affiliation) in two large probability samples of the general population (N1 = 3,132; N2 = 2,483) from the American National Election Studies (ANES). We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the causal assumptions between the latent variables and used survey weights to generate estimates that were representative of the population. Different from prior theories, across both datasets we found that two personality traits, agreeableness and conscientiousness, were directly associated with anti-black prejudice when controlling for authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, and political party affiliation. We also found that a substantial part of the associations between personality traits and anti-black prejudice were mediated through those social and ideological attitudes, which might serve as candidates for prejudice-reduction interventions in the real world.

T1  - The School as a Double-Edged Panopticon—Increased Anxiety and Deflated Islamic Identities: A Child-Centered Perspective on the Trojan Horse Affair
AN  - 2423101249
AB  - The Trojan Hose Affair scandal alleged that there was a hardline extremist Islamism plot to take over British state schools in Birmingham. While community groups and government officials battled to take control of the narrative, the pupils who were ultimately at the center of the scandal, were not considered. This paper is based on research conducted in 2015, with students at one of the schools implicated in the Trojan Horse Affair. Through seven one-to-one interviews and a group discussion, the research finds that students portrayed their selves in a state of constant psychological reconciliation due to the heightened mediatization, racialization, and securitization of Islam and Muslims, during and after the Trojan Horse affair. This caused increased levels of anxiety in students, which peaked around the constant surveillance through the gaze of the media, teachers, and Ofsted inspectors, creating a double-edged Panopticon. The paper particularly underscores student concerns for potential social exclusion and discrimination they may experience as a result of the school affiliation.

T1  - Imagined contact and mental illness stigma in an Asian context: Bolstering the effect and examining the impact of factual information
AN  - 2400268190
AB  - Imagined contact can be effective at reducing social stigma. However, the effect may depend on the strength of the stigma held. We tested the robustness of imagined contact in an Asian setting where stigmatization of mental illness is stronger than in Western countries. In Experiment 1 (n = 167) with five conditions, only an enhanced version of positive imagined contact was able to decrease stigma towards people with schizophrenia through decreasing intergroup anxiety. Given the potential discrepancy between imaginations and reality about experiences with stigmatized groups, in Experiment 2 (n = 121), we tested the hypothesis that after presenting participants with factual information about a mental illness group, imagined contact might backfire, resulting in more negative perceptions. However, enhanced imagined contact alongside factual message about schizophrenia did not increase stigma. The backfiring hypothesis was therefore not supported. Nevertheless, providing realistic information did negate the positive effects of enhanced imagined contact on stigma reduction. In both experiments, we also showed that intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of enhanced imagined contact on various measures of stigma.

T1  - Regulating emotions under exposure to negative out-group-related news material results in increased acceptance of out-groups
AN  - 2391192799
AB  - Negative emotions affect the acceptance of out-groups. Here, we investigated whether modifying negative emotions would affect perceptions of out-groups. We experimentally manipulated the use of two emotion regulation strategies: suppression of emotional expression and cognitive reappraisal, the latter involving reframing a situation to mitigate its emotional impact. Using a population-based sample (N = 317), we conducted an online randomized controlled trial. Participants regulated their emotions while reading threatening news about out-groups. Not only reappraisal, but also suppression increased immediate acceptance of out-groups. The effect of reappraisal was partly mediated by decreased disgust, suggesting unique effects of reappraisal on this emotion. In the suppression condition acceptance decreased at high levels of habitual emotion regulation, whereas reappraisal showed an opposite tendency. Previous research may have underestimated the importance of different emotion regulation strategies on prejudice, and that relatively simple interventions can affect prejudice. The findings are of interest to prejudice prevention programs.

T1  - Prejudice and Protestations: Rereading Yu Xuanji's Poetry
AN  - 2403114133
AB  - Aged only fifteen, Yu Xuanji 魚玄機 (ca. 844–869), a native of Chang'an 長安, began her adult life as a lesser wife of a learned man. After losing her husband's favours, she joined the Daoist priesthood and remained single for the rest of her days. Graced with both uncommon beauty and a flair for composition, Yu lived only for twenty-five years but she managed to leave behind a valuable collection of poems, forty-nine of which are preserved in Quan Tangshi (The Completed Tang Poems).[1] For centuries, many of her poems have been criticised as decadent and depraved by traditional critics such as Huang-fu Mei 皇甫枚 (ca. 880–901), Sun Guangxian 孫光憲 (ca. 900–968) and Hu Zhenheng 胡震亨 (1569–1645), who attacks her fiercely, claiming that 'Yu is the most lascivious; her poetry is decadent too' (魚最淫蕩，詩体亦靡弱).[2] Such criticism has influenced Chinese literati of later periods so profoundly that even today it remains the wont of many to label Yu as a dissolute woman. Recently, however, her reputation has been partially salvaged by some scholars. For example, the two articles written by Suzanne Cahill[3] and a book-length study by the Chinese scholar Li Suping 李素平 have challenged the orthodox view about Yu and offered new perspectives on her work. Though pioneering and inspiring, neither of these authors examines the roots of Yu's notoriety. In one article, focused on the female voices in poetry of the Tang dynasty, Cahill discusses the verses of four female priests together with no touch of literati's commentary of their works; in another, she examines Yu's work from the standpoint of material culture and Daoist religion. Suping's book fleshes out the place of women in Daoism as part of its broader coverage of Daoism as a philosophy and literary phenomenon, but it makes only passing references to the works of female Daoists. Thus, many questions about Yu abound. For example, why did classical critics consider Yu a prostitute? What is Yu's outlook on love? How did Yu define herself? Maureen Robertson argues, 'Curiosity and a desire for insight into women's lives may lead one to read a text as a transparent and unproblematic revelation of a historical woman's thoughts and feelings and to overlook the multiply-mediated nature of feminine voices in literary texts.'[5] Yet, since few pre-modern historians care to write about women, especially women like Yu, in their chronicles, for modern readers, the only access to Yu is through either statements of traditional critics or Yu's own poetry, both literary sources.I agree with Cahill, 'As we have used Tang men's poetry as a historical source, so we should use Tang women's poetry.'[6] This study attempts to re-examine Yu's love poems and the remarks others have made about her work and life. In particular, by studying her most targeted poems, I will not only explore the source of Yu's notorious reputation but also show that, though living in the ninth century, Yu had a surprisingly enlightened view of love and relationship, which illustrates her strong desire for the equality between men and women.

T1  - Religiousness and Rape Myth Acceptance: Risk and Protective Effects
AN  - 2360928109
AB  - This study addressed the lack of research simultaneously examining multiple dimensions of religiousness when predicting rape myth acceptance, and extended prior findings of a mediating role for right-wing authoritarianism (i.e., uncritical submission to authority and aggressive attitude toward those who do not conform to social norms) in the association between religiousness and prejudice. The sample consisted of 99 undergraduate and graduate students (M age = 31.87 years, 66.7% female, 80.82% White, and 93% Christian affiliated) from a religiously affiliated university in the Midwest United States. As hypothesized, dimensions of religiousness exhibited differential associations with rape myth acceptance. Religious motivation characterized by openness and exploration (i.e., quest religiousness) was a significant negative predictor of rape myth acceptance, directly, and indirectly through right-wing authoritarianism. In contrast, rigid adherence to religious beliefs, assumed to be “right” and absolutely true (i.e., religious fundamentalism), and extrinsically motivated religiousness each exhibited a positive association with rape myth acceptance through right-wing authoritarianism. In addition, internally motivated religiousness and religious fundamentalism each moderated the nonlinear effect for quest predicting rape myth acceptance. Findings suggest that uncritical religious and secular submission to external authorities or uncommitted and nonexploring religiousness may have increased the extent to which persons adhered to rape myths, whereas religious exploration was protective. Practical implications center on the need for socioculturally relevant prevention and intervention efforts with religious identifying college students.

T1  - Asylum seekers in the global context of xenophobia: Introduction to the special issue
AN  - 2355233178
AB  - In 2015 the global media fixated on the ‘Syrian crisis’ that became the ‘refugee crisis’ for Europe. This construction of crisis was Eurocentric, temporally narrow and presented as problem for European nation states. We view the ‘problem’ rather as the nationalism and racism of receiving countries with a resurgence of a discourse of ethno-nationalist European identity sharpened by the global financial crisis and neoliberal austerity.Despite disparate national histories, we discern:a ‘blame-the-victim’ tendency to view those most harmed by the ‘refugee crisis’ as the ‘problems’ that constitute it;a state-centred perspective that requires the ‘problem’ to be addressed by nation states;a ‘charity starts at home’ ideology, usually from those sectors of society that are least willing to extend compassion ‘at home’;a systemically cruel state disposition towards asylum seekers as part of a regime of deterrence from seeking asylum in that state;a racialised and gender-blinkered regime of determination of refugee status;a politically opportunist populism that deploys ethno-nationalist ‘othering’ or scapegoating in times of economic distress and political instability;a wilful and convenient blindness to the histories of the contemporary conflicts as the legacies of colonialism;a globalised Islamophobia, casting Muslim asylum seekers as a potential security threat and undermining of national (or ‘western’, or civilisational) values;a gender-inflected racialisation that demonises the asylum-seeking other as hyper-patriarchal and occludes or minimises the patriarchy of the ‘civilised’ west. *repeats six paras on*

T1  - ‘Art is my language’: Afghan cultural production challenging Islamophobic stereotypes
AN  - 2355230950
AB  - Afghans and Afghanistan have, since September 11, risen to prominence in Western popular imagination as a land of tradition, tribalism and violence. Afghan women are assumed to be silent, submissive, and terrorised by Afghan men, who are seen as violent patriarchs driven by an uncompromising mediaeval religion. These Islamophobic tropes also inform perceptions of Afghans seeking asylum. In transit, identities are further reduced; asylum seekers lose even a national identity and become a Muslim threat – criminals, terrorists or invaders. These narrative frames permeate political discourse, media, and reports of non-governmental organisations (seeking donor funds to ‘save’ Afghan women). Drawing on fieldwork in Afghanistan and Indonesia, this article looks at how Afghans in Kabul and Indonesia are using art and other forms of cultural production to challenge over-simplified hegemonic narratives in the West, to open spaces for dialogue and expression within their own communities, and to offer a more nuanced account of their own identities.

T1  - Identification with the American South and Anti-Muslim Attitudes
AN  - 2353195013
AB  - The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016. In addition, the number of hate crimes committed against members of the religion jumped 67% in 2015 alone. Addressing the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice is critical. We examined (N = 406) the role of regional identification in predicting anti-Muslim attitudes. That is, identification with the American South, a more conservative and religious part of the country with a history of slavery and violent secession movements, predicted anti-Muslim attitudes. This relationship was mediated by conservation values. For Southerners who strongly identified with “the South”, the endorsement of values related to a general resistance to change led to greater anti-Muslim attitudes. Anti-Muslim bias may lie in perceptions of threat: for strongly identified Southerners, the Muslim faith is viewed as a societal threat.

T1  - The impact of race relations on NFL attendance: An econometric analysis
AN  - 2344551098
AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts.

T1  - Youth of Color Living and Learning in the Age of Racial Paranoia: What Social Justice Educators Need to Know
AN  - 2341735585
AB  - Fearing the other has been entrenched in the minds of many Americans. With Donald J. Trump becoming president of the U.S., overt racism is being reinserted into mainstream politics. Trump's victory has ushered in an era beset by racial paranoia-fear socially constructed about Black and Brown bodies, learned at home, in schools, and from the mainstream media, and expressed in unjust and, at times, violent manners. Indeed, racial paranoia has caused racially prejudiced individuals or groups to behave and act in violent ways against people of color. This essay draws from critical race theory and present day political events involving the Donald Trump government to explore racial paranoia and its multilayered effects on people of color, particularly youth of color. This article underscores plausible parallels between racial paranoia and the attitude, behavior, and actions of people holding White supremacist ideology and their violence against people of all colors, particularly youth of color. This articler provides suggestions that might serve educators who are working with historically disenfranchised youth of color, including immigrant youth of color.

T1  - Media portrayal of terrorism and Muslims: a content analysis of Turkey and France
AN  - 2220517830
AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue.

T1  - Mistaken Identities: The Media and Parental Ethno-Religious Socialization in a Midwestern Sikh Community
AN  - 2328400508
AB  - The role of the media in constructing the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims and the effects of that image on Muslim communities in the United States have been well reported (Abbas 2004).

[...]the portrayal of Muslims in popular media has intensified stereotypical images of several other ethno-religious groups in the United States, among them Sikhs (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kromidas 2004; Kumar 2016).

Since boys and men are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination due to their outward identity markers, the focus of this study was ethno-religious socialization of boys. 1.1.

According to the American Sikh Organization, this number could, in fact, be as large as 500,000 (Pew Forum 2012).

[...]of the ensuing problem of misidentification, Sikh communities have found support in collective practices that serve as antidotes to negative stereotypes (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kurien 2014).

T1  - An online experiment on the influence of online user comments on attitudes toward a minority group
AN  - 2318594529
AB  - In recent years, there is interest in examining the effects of user comments on online content consumers' attitudes and perceptions. Building on theoretical foundations from social psychology and using an online experimental design, we investigated whether exposure to online comments attached to news content affects attitudes toward refugees. We recruited students from a public university in the Mediterranean region and, after administering a printed pretest on their attitudes toward refugees, we assigned them into three groups: one that read a series of positive comments about refugees (positive experimental group), one that read a series of negative comments about refugees (negative experimental group) and one that did not read comments (control group). The comments and a neutral reference news video were communicated to the participants via email during a five-day period after the pretest. After the implementation of the experimental stimuli, we administered a modified version of the pretest as a posttest. We found that exposure to positive comments reduced prejudice and that the intensity of prior prejudice was positively associated with the magnitude of prejudice reduction. Exposure to negative comments did not affect prejudice. A repeat posttest, administered one week after the posttest, showed stability of the observed attitude change.

T1  - Impairment, socialization and embodiment: The sexual oppression of people with physical disabilities
AN  - 2272039859
AB  - People with disabilities face multiple forms of social exclusion, discrimination, and oppression, including in the domain of sex and sexuality. From a critical psychoanalytic viewpoint, social responses to persons with impairments are strongly unconsciously mediated, and often dominated by projections based on archaic anxieties about dependency, vulnerability, and shame. Where disability meets sexuality, these defenses may be more prominent still, resulting, for one example, in the prejudiced myth that people with disabilities are disinterested in, or not capable of, sex. Using this theoretical stance, this paper examines how the developmental role of family and societal influences on the social constructions of sexuality and disability are internalized, resisted, and negotiated by two South Africans with physical disabilities. Data are drawn from interview material elicited via photovoice methodology. The interview narratives and photographic images are used to explore how sexual oppression may be internalized, creating intra-psychic barriers to inclusion for this already structurally disadvantaged group.

T1  - Third-party prejudice accommodation increases gender discrimination
AN  - 2256512399
AB  - We investigated how gatekeepers sometimes arrive at discriminatory hiring selections to accommodate prejudiced third parties due to role demands (i.e., the "third-party prejudice effect"). Studies 1 and 2 show that individuals in charge of personnel decisions were significantly less likely to select a woman when a relevant third party (the chief executive officer of the company in Study 1; the "proposer" in an ultimatum game in Study 2) was prejudiced against women. Gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice in this way in order to avoid conflict in relations and task-related problems that would likely occur if the gatekeeper introduced a member of the target of prejudice into an organization. Studies 3 and 4 demonstrated that both interpersonal and task-focused concerns significantly mediated third-party prejudice accommodation. Furthermore, experimentally reducing task-focused concerns significantly reduced the accommodation of third-party prejudice against women (Study 4). We also found that gatekeepers accommodate third-party prejudice regardless of their own beliefs and attitudes (Studies 5 and 6), or their own desire to get along or affiliate with the third party (Study 7), and despite leading to feelings of guilt (Studies 4 and 5). Both men and women accommodated third-party prejudice against women. A role-based framework can be useful to understand the persistence of gender inequality in various fields and organizations, even as individuals endorse increasingly gender-egalitarian views.

T1  - Embodying 'the Nordic race': imaginaries of Viking heritage in the online communications of the Nordic Resistance Movement
AN  - 2238516152
AB  - Kølvraa's article focuses on the cultural imaginary of the Scandinavian extreme right by analysing the online presence of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement. He seeks to show how the cultural imaginaries of this National Socialist organization make use of the Scandinavian Viking heritage in three distinct ways. First, to produce a distinctly Nordic form of National Socialism and thus potentially make this ideology palatable to Nordic publics. Second, to differentiate their racially oriented political project from a wider far-right or populist right concern with the defence of European Christian heritage and/or civilization against Islam. And, third, to thematize and perform a certain hyper-masculine identity, especially in the context of martial and sporting competitions arranged by the organization.

T1  - Multicultural and colorblind, investigating intergroup ideologies and relevant relations in mainland China
AN  - 2245656166
AB  - During the past decades, studies of acculturation and ideology have received great attention in social psychology, especially among western countries. But few such investigations have been conducted in Asia. In this study, we measured personal and normative support of three intergroup ideologies in the context of mainland China, and explored their mediating roles between social dominance orientation and prejudice. Surveys were conducted among 158 Chinese university students in Hangzhou, China. Results of the present study showed that the dominant societal ideology among Chinese respondents was multiculturalism, rather than assimilation or colorblindness. Moreover, based on the proposition that support for different ideologies was likely to have different effects in different countries, mediation model of personal support for ideologies was examined in the current context. As revealed, when the social norms were salient, personal support for multiculturalism mediated the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudice, while personal support for assimilation or colorblindness did not. The present study provided additional evidence to the previous theory, implications and suggestions were further discussed.

T1  - Ms Marvel, Qahera, and superheroism in the Muslim diaspora: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2193421831
AB  - This article examines how Marvel Comics' Ms Marvel, in her newest iteration as a Pakistani Muslim young woman, challenges the conventions of race and American citizenship in the post-9/11 United States. I place Ms Marvel in conversation with the webcomic Qahera the Superhero, which was created by an Egyptian artist, in order to demonstrate the ways in which both texts have an ability to reach readers on a global scale and powerfully reimagine visual representations of Muslim women and female superheroes. My investigation includes an analysis of the comics and the epitexts that surround these works, such as author and editor interviews and various forms of public response in order to demonstrate how these media engage with a specific racial, ethnic, and (inter)national community in a meaningful way; one which complicates the definition of 'fans,' 'comic book readers,' and 'heroes.' When juxtaposed Ms Marvel and Qahera emerge as artifacts of visual, digital culture whose significance is particularly salient when read in our current political era, as a means of uncovering and combating racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

T1  - 'I can't remember a more depressing time but I don't blame anyone for that': remembering and commemorating the wartime internment of enemy aliens in Britain
AN  - 2173651037
AB  - In October 2000, David Cesarani decried the unnecessary internment of refugees from Nazi Germany in Britain during the Second World War on the BBC Radio 4 programme Behind the Wire. Until the last few decades, little was known about the internment of enemy aliens by the British during the war. However, in recent years, novels such as David Baddiel's The Secret Purposes, published in 2004, and exhibitions such as 'Schwitters in Britain' at the Tate Britain in 2013, have introduced a wider audience to this oft-forgotten part of the British wartime narrative. Some of those interned in Britain were sent to Canada and Australia, which led to the greatest tragedy of the entire internment debacle, the sinking of the Arandora Star. The year 2015 marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of this tragedy, and the memory of those who were lost lives on in the British-Italian community. However, outside those affected by the Arandora Star disaster, little is commemorated or understood by the general public. Yet the legacy of the former internees is all around us. Who has not, on visiting the British Library, walked past former internee's Eduardo Paolozzi's statue of Newton? What connoisseur of classical music has not enjoyed the sound of the Amadeus Quartet, perhaps the only positive outcome of internment? Pistol's article will examine the memory of the camps and consider the differences between how internment has been remembered and commemorated by former internees and the general public.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - Shedding New Light on the Evaluation of Accented Speakers: Basic Mechanisms Behind Nonnative Listeners’ Evaluations of Nonnative Accented Job Candidates
AN  - 2154458989
AB  - The present research unites two emergent trends in the area of language attitudes: (a) research on perceptions of nonnative speakers by nonnative listeners and (b) the search for general, basic mechanisms underlying the evaluation of nonnative accented speakers. In three experiments featuring an employment situation, German participants listened to a presentation given in English by a German speaker with a strong versus native-like accent (in Studies 1–3) versus a native speaker of English (in Study 1). They evaluated candidates with a strong accent worse than candidates with a native(-like) pronunciation—even to the degree that the quality of arguments was of no relevance (Study 1). Study 2 introduces an effective intervention to reduce these discriminatory tendencies. Across studies, affect and competence emerged as major mediators of hirability evaluations. Study 3 further revealed sequential indirect influences, which advance our understanding of previous inconsistent findings regarding disfluency and warmth perceptions.

T1  - Navigating Islam: The Hijab and the American Workplace
AN  - 2318717103
AB  - The United States Constitution allows individuals to practice any religion they choose. However, the austerity of this right is tested when an individual’s belief is publicly displayed. For Muslim women wearing the hijab, or headscarf, the intersection between private religious practice and its social expression is explored on a daily basis. To fully understand the manifestation of public religious expression, this paper examines a series of interviews with 35 hijab-wearing Muslim women living in the United States. By exploring the lived experiences of Muslim-American women, this paper highlights the broader issues of the media’s influence on perceptions of Muslim culture, the complex and often unclear legality of religious symbols in the workplace, and the barriers that exist for hijab-wearing women in the workplace. With the rise of Islamophobia, the participants found a stronger sense to exert their right to express their religious identities. Moreover, the women interviewed demonstrate their agency by continuing to embrace their religious practice despite intersecting forms of discrimination.

T1  - Islamophobia in Australia: From Far-Right Deplorables to Respectable Liberals
AN  - 2302560159
AB  - In Australia since about the turn of the millennium, discrimination against Muslims has been increasingly normalized, made respectable, and presented as prudent precaution against violent extremism. Vilification of Muslims has posed as defending ‘Australian values’ against those who will not integrate. Liberal political leaders and press leader-writers who formerly espoused cultural pluralism now routinely hold up as inimical the Muslim folk devil by whose otherness the boundaries of acceptability of the national culture may be marked out and policed. The Muslim Other is positioned not only as culturally incommensurate, but dangerously so: dishonest, criminally inclined, violent, misogynist, homophobic, backward, uncivilized. On the far right, extremist nationalist organizations incite racist hatred under cover of this rhetoric, often cloaked as reasonable common sense. This paper undertakes an ideology analysis of political and media discussion, and examines the forms of social control that they advance and sustain.

T1  - Online Gamers, Lived Experiences, and Sense of Belonging: Students at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein
AN  - 2139622802
AB  - Individuals who partake in video games are often regarded with prejudice. It is an activity that is perceived to be mainly related to senseless leisure and teenage entertainment. However, many diverse people make video games such an important part of their lives that they become passionately engaged in it. Video games and online video gaming offer the player immersive experiences unlike any other forms of media. A phenomenological and interpretive exploration is undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of the narratives of online gamers and their experiences of a sense of belonging to the associated online communities. Through the use of in-depth interviews, the article explores various aspects of the life stories of a group of eight South African university students. It attempts to show how online gaming has become a part of their lifeworlds. The aim of this article is to present the narratives of online gamers as rich and descriptive accounts that maintain the voices of the participants. Various aspects of the lifeworlds of online gamers are explored. Firstly, an exploration is undertaken to gain an understanding of what it means to be a gamer. It focuses on how a person can become involved with gaming and how it can evolve into something that a person is engaged with on a daily basis. Secondly, it explores how video games influence the perception of reality of gamers. Immersion in video games can transfer a player into an alternative reality and can take the focus away from the real world. This can lead to feelings of joy and excitement, but can also lead to escapism. Lastly, the article shifts attention towards how online video gamers experience online communities. Players can have positive experiences with random strangers online, but because of the anonymous nature of the online environment, it can also lead to negative and isolating experiences.

T1  - Intercultural contact, knowledge of Islam, and prejudice against muslims in Australia
AN  - 2132685941
AB  - This article empirically investigates the relationship between intercultural contact, factual and self-reported knowledge of Islam, and prejudice against Muslims in Australia. We propose an original measure of factual knowledge of Islam, based on the measurement of political sophistication, used alongside more established measures of intercultural contact and self-reported knowledge. The results show that possessing more knowledge about Islam and having more contact with Muslims is associated with less prejudice against Muslims regardless of whether an individual identifies or not with conservative parties (such as the Liberal–National coalition), whether they are older or younger, female or male, or more or less educated or religious. Moreover, factual knowledge and self-reported knowledge are found to have different effects on prejudice: whereas factual knowledge is associated with less prejudice, self-reported knowledge tends to be associated with more prejudice. Subsequently, we use mediation analysis to clarify the empirical and theoretical relationships between intercultural contact, factual knowledge, and prejudice against Muslims.

T1  - Framing Muslims in the “War on Terror”: Representations of Ideological Violence by Muslim versus Non-Muslim Perpetrators in Canadian National News Media
AN  - 2124319441
AB  - This study compared representations of ideological violence by Muslim versus non-Muslim perpetrators in Canadian national news media (the Globe and Mail, National Post, and CBC). Both quantitative and qualitative disparities were examined. Acts of Muslim violence received 1.5 times more coverage, on average, than non-Muslim ones, and thwarted Muslim plots received five times more coverage. Muslim incidents were more likely to be labelled “terrorism” and linked to other episodes of violence, and Muslim perpetrators were more likely to be labelled by their religious and ethno-racial identities. These patterns in representation serve to stabilise the racial formations of the Canadian national security state in the “war on terror”.

T1  - Iraq Wars from the other Side: Transmodern Reconciliation in Sinan Antoon’s The Corpse Washer
AN  - 2124148623
AB  - In the last years, more and more literary accounts of recent and current wars in the Middle East have been published. In most cases, they are authored from a Western viewpoint and provide a narrow account of the Muslim world. This article focuses on Sinan Antoon’s The Corpse Washer because it opens the scope. That is, it constitutes an alternative to the imagery of the American film industry. Moreover, as Antoon is a Christian, his account of contemporary Iraq is particularly peripheral and hybrid. To analyse the novel, this article makes use of Transmodernity, a concept coined by Rosa María Rodríguez Magda in 1989. Yet, instead of Magda’s Transmodernity as a neatly Euro-centric phenomenon of worldwide connectivity, Ziauddin Sardar’s version of the concept is preferred. Sardar’s Transmodernity adds to connectivity a message of reconciliation between progress and tradition, particularly in the context of non-Western cultures. This paper defends that Antoon’s novel opens the debate on Islam to challenge the prejudiced Western discourses that have ‘legitimized’ war. To do so, Sardar’s ‘borders’ and Judith Butler’s grievability are particularly useful. In a Transmodern context, novels like Antoon’s show that humans should never be bare lives.

T1  - Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience
AN  - 2313793045
AB  - Social media use can have major impacts on one’s construction of identity, sexuality, and gender. However, some social media sites exhibit problematic and prejudiced themes through their photo and video posts. This paper examines two Instagram sites specifically targeting traditionally college-aged individuals. These sites have tens of thousands of followers, post frequently, and solely focus on highlighting the college experience. Through a textual analysis of these two sites, problematic themes emerged, including objectification of female college students, submissiveness of female college students, and emphasis on a young white college experience. These themes are detailed and explored, followed by a discussion on their potential impacts on broader societal structures and ideas for education on gendered prejudices in the media.

T1  - The effect of Social dominance on prejudice towards North-African minorities: Evidence for the role of social representation of Secularism as a legitimizing myth
AN  - 2098783658
AB  - Secularism in France is both a state principle and a cultural construct, that enforces a State neutrality towards religion. Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of a lay conception called ‘New Secularism’ (NS) that is used to legitimize expression of prejudice towards North African minorities. However, none have been able to yet demonstrate links between NS and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), which would further corroborate those beliefs’ role as prejudice justification. Using Social Representations Theory, we created a Secularism questionnaire and used it in a cross sectional survey (N = 261) that also included SDO and Generalized Prejudice measures. In order to test social representation of Secularism’s legitimizing function, we derived the hypothesis that NS will mediate the link between SDO and expressed Prejudice from a Social Dominance perspective. Results support our predictions and are discussed in light of intergroup status quo legitimization processes and their links with social representations.

T1  - Truly, madly, deeply ... nostalgically? Britain's on-off love affair with refugees, past and present
AN  - 2031357047
AB  - Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of 'history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.

Many of these expressions include social identity work, such as the articulation, affirmation, or policing of a shared identity. In this study, we examine one online space in which users engage in social identity work: a Reddit forum (r/starterpacks) that primarily generates and discusses image memes of a very specific format: the “starter pack.” Users leverage these image memes to convey what we refer to in this article as prototypes of social identities. Many of these prototypical depictions are necessarily influenced by offline social groups and/or consumer culture, and are furthermore constructed around gendered, racial, or ethnic stereotypes. To understand how these image memes are used to form and perpetuate prototypes of social identities, we employed content analysis to evaluate a sample of 500 image meme artifacts created, shared, and upvoted by the subreddit’s users. We discuss the process of applying visual analysis techniques to articulate themes identified in the image meme expressions, in particular: (1) the default of the White, male identity in starter pack characterizations; (2) the production of oppressive social identities through the use of visual and textual content; and (3) the dedication to a stance of “consumption” in assembling starter pack memes, both through body politics expressed therein and use of consumer goods in images. Finally, we draw on reader response theory to frame the challenges of researchers “reading” starter pack memes, despite employing systematic methods of analysis.

T1  - Reinforcing Sexism and Misogyny: Social Media, Symbolic Violence and the Construction of Femininity-as-Fail
AN  - 2057939820
AB  - This paper demonstrates, through content analysis, how online audiences can enforce gender based violence (GBV) as a real threat in the online space through verbally aggressive speech acts that function as symbolic violence. I examine cases emerging out of the context of Trinidad and Tobago, to articulate, how, for example, prejudicial chastising of women is used as a discourse to not only shame and blame but construct femininity-as-fail, however that femininity is embodied. This symbolic violence I read as a spectre, a force that enforces, both in the offline and online, the reassertion of strict respectability and responsibility as standard. This is done through victim blaming and policing, especially of women's bodies, voice and agency. I assert that such talk constitutes an online environment that serves as fertile ground for the reconstitution of traditional and limiting notions of femininity. Such an environment also facilitates constant backlash against feminist discourses and feminist activism to attain gender justice in the Caribbean region. The online environment is a force that breaches offline boundaries across the globe, thus its effect must be accounted for as we attempt to build the resilience of feminist consciousness and gender justice.

T1  - Contemporary Methodological Approaches to Qualitative Research: A Review of The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Methods
AN  - 2013609580
AB  - Researchers can discover the dynamism of new methods of qualitative inquiry and discover new applications for the established methods. The Oxford Handbook of Qualitative Methods (2014), edited by Patricia Leavy examines topics ranging from the politics of knowledge to researcher prejudice and bias extant in qualitative research. History, ethics, philosophy, and theoretical approaches of qualitative research are presented in a cogent manner. Topics include grounded theory, feminist research, indigenous methodologies, narrative inquiry, ethnography, case studies, oral history, content analysis, Internet research, photography and arts-based research, community-based research, qualitative disaster research, and mixed-methods. Chapters are devoted to skill-building techniques for interviewing, focus groups, coding and analysis strategies, writing, and evaluating qualitative research. This book will become a valued resource for scholars.

T1  - Perceived threat to national values in evaluating stereotyped immigrants
AN  - 1992034306
AB  - The present research examined the psychological reasons behind Americans' (un)willingness to accept immigrants. Participants read a scenario depicting immigrant groups allegedly expected to arrive in the United States and evaluated how much the immigrants would influence two types of American national values: civic values (e.g., political ideology) and ethnic values (e.g., shared culture and customs). Across three studies, competitive immigrant groups were stereotyped to be untrustworthy and perceived to threaten American civic values, but not ethnic values. Value threat then mediated the predicted competition-prejudice relationship in Study 3. Perceived vulnerability of in-group boundary might specify one motivated cause of derogating immigrants.

T1  - The Egyptian Sisters Club: negotiating community and identity in a time of conflict
AN  - 2019054918
AB  - On the screens of televisions and computers in their California homes, the women of the Egyptian Sisters Club (ESC) have witnessed the unfolding of political crisis and the unravelling of certainty about the meaning of 'home'. Drawing from concepts of diaspora and social support, the study explores how the ESC, an informal group of young Egyptian mothers living in Southern California, maintains cohesion in a time of conflict in their home country, and hostility towards visibly Muslim women in their host country. This qualitative study draws from participant observation, interviews and focus groups over a period of 9 months in 2014. Findings, largely expressed in members' own words, suggest that despite heterogeneous perspectives and subjective motives, participants largely negotiate a prioritization of cultural values over political differences. This case offers insights into how local context and life stages influence how diaspora members adapt to contentious home and host country politics.

T1  - Globalization, Ageing Process and Attitudes of Younger Generations to Ageing
TT  - GLOBALIZACIJA, PROCES STARENJA I STAVOVI MLAĐIH GENERACIJA PREMA STARENJU
AN  - 2187918351
AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image.Alternate abstract:S obzirom na porast udjela starije populacije u većini društava, čini se važnim istražiti ovu problematiku s različitih aspekata u cilju poboljšanja položaja starijih i prepoznavanja njihovog doprinosa u društvu. Cilj istraživanja bio je ispitati iskustva i mišljenja generacije Z, o predrasudama i diskriminaciji prema starijim osobama. Ispitanici su bili mlađe životne dobi, prema starosti pripadaju generaciji Z. Podaci su prikupljeni putem fokus grupe, a koristila su se pitanja otvorenog tipa. Rezultati kvalitativnog istraživanja ukazuju na: 1) nepovoljan odnos društva prema starijim osobama, 2) uzroke diskriminacije starijih osoba, 3) predrasude prema starijim osobama. Bolja edukacija (posebno djece i mladih), neposredni kontakt sa starijim osobama (omogućavanje susreta za razmjenu iskustava te prenošenja tradicijskih i kulturnih vrijednosti), te bolja medijska prezentacija starenja i starosti doprinijela bi smanjenju globalizacije starenja i boljem odnosu mlađih generacija prema starenju. Važan utjecaj na poglede mladih ima obitelj i potrebno je motivirati roditelje da pozitivno prezentiraju starenje i starost. Također, važno je raditi i sa starijim osobama u smislu njihovog osnaživanja i razvijanja pozitivnije slike o sebi.

T1  - East-west trans-mediatisation of terrorism and Islamophobia: Sydney siege and Peshawar massacre: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1979942594
AB  - This article interrogates the notions of terrorism and Islamophobia in two cultural sites. Deploying case study, the article examines the 15 December 2014 Lindt Café siege in Australia and the 16 December 2014 Army Public School massacre in Pakistan. These sites were selected for comparative analysis due to their concurrence and as concerns surrounding terrorism have been mostly West-centric. Findings show that despite socio-political differences, terror attacks in both states ignited activist movements such as 'Reclaim Pakistan' and 'Reclaim Australia', with both aiming to eradicate extremism. However, while the former focused on the need to reclaim the country from militants, the latter engaged in hate narratives about Islam and Muslims. Islamophobia was identified in Australia, with Taliban-phobia and rejection of Islamo-fascism in Pakistan, as Pakistanis negotiated their identities in a pluralistic Muslim world. The article suggests the need for both local and global processes that are culturally appropriate to mitigate terrorism.

T1  - Muslims in Europe: Citizenship, Multiculturalism and Integration
AN  - 1975714370
AB  - This article provides an analysis of the concerns in relation to citizenship and multicultural reforms in Europe. It examines the implications for the social integration of Muslims, who seemingly face insurmountable constitutional hurdles notwithstanding liberal institutional attempts, in accommodating a religion that, judged by its global politicisation, may pose more a challenge to multicultural societies than to others. While shedding light on recent developments concerning a wide-ranging panorama of the socio-legal dynamics of integrating Muslim communities in Europe, the article provides an overview of the multicultural idea, focusing on how some European countries address multicultural claims swiftly while others lag behind, busy with more basic issues of immigrant assimilation and integration. It is argued that while attempts are being made to improve Muslim integration, the rising tide of Islamophobia (political and media-manufactured), anti-terrorism legislations and security policies serve to provide a multi-pronged attack on civil liberties and freedoms of Muslim groups. In the concluding section, there will be general remarks concerning the future of Muslims in Europe and the commendable and realisable aim of Muslims to construct an inclusive national identity and find partners who will, like them, be determined to approve what Western culture produces in terms of its positive contributions and resist its deleterious effects on the human, societal and environmental levels.

T1  - The "Trojan Horse" Plot and the Fear of Muslim Power in British State Schools
AN  - 1975714238
AB  - In 2014, an alleged "Trojan Horse" plot to Islamise education in a number of schools attended predominantly by diverse Muslim pupils in the inner city wards of Birmingham raised considerable questions. Ofsted investigations of 21 schools explored these concerns at the behest of the then Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove MP. At the head of this so-called plot, a certain Tahir Alam, once a darling of New Labour's policies on British Muslim schools, faced the brunt of the media and political furore. Based on a series of face-to-face interviews with Alam in 2015 and 2016, this paper provides a detailed insight into the allegations, the context in which they emerged and the implications raised for young Muslims in the education system. Ultimately, as part of the government's counter-terrorism policy the accusations of the "Islamisation" of education in these "Trojan Horse" schools foreshadowed the additional securitisation of all sectors of education. However, there was neither the evidence nor the legal justification to ratchet up anti-extremism education measures that eventually followed; namely the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. The consequences of the negative attention heightened existing Islamophobia but, paradoxically, they also limited the opportunities for de-radicalisation through education.

T1  - Social Dominance Orientation: A root of resistance to intercultural dialogue?
AN  - 1980698578
AB  - Intercultural dialogue is a process central to creating a just social world. Despite this, people are often prejudiced against it. In order to better understand the nature of this antagonism, the present research investigated the role of Social Dominance Orientation as one potential source of resistance. Across three studies, the direct and mediated impact of SDO on both self-reported and behaviorally-indicated dialogic engagement was assessed. Results provide evidence that increasing levels of SDO encourage ideological beliefs and social evaluations that, in turn, prejudice participants against dialogue with an African-American woman. The significance of these results is discussed, along with suggestions for future research.

T1  - The class politics of prejudice: Brexit and the land of no-hope and glory
AN  - 1961335251
AB  - The debates relating to social class and whether it is still a useful concept in describing a lived reality of the British population has never been far away from media, political and academic dispute. Thatcher's Britain throughout the 1980s attempted to dilute class meaning with what was called 'a home owning democracy' and thus end class collective politics through easily available credit for the working class while simultaneously attacking trade union organization, recruitment and political action. During the late 1990s and into the noughties a 'New Labour' administration attempted to exacerbate the end of class politics through an agenda of a 'cultural distinction' to class identity. Class struggle, class politics and class identity is embedded deep within the cultural norms practices, and history of British democracy. Consequently it is difficult if not impossible to prise class inequality in the UK away from and out of national, local and personal politics (Savage et al. 2015: 393-8). This paper focuses upon the sense that class politics, and cultural class distinction, within the UK had the biggest influence in determining a working-class 'Leave Vote' in the 2016 referendum within the UK. This paper explores accounts and narratives from working-class 'leave' voters though an ethnographic study of the political and social viewpoints of working-class communities of East London, and of ex-mining towns of Nottinghamshire. Framing into fuller context the anger and apathy of being 'left out', arguing that being 'left out' has been part of working-class political narratives for over 30 years. Going beyond frustration and apathy, a significant part of the narrative of working people was of 'not existing', suggesting certain important linkages with ongoing debates about new ways of conceptualizing class differences and class structures.

T1  - Positioning young refugees in Australia: media discourse and social exclusion
AN  - 1952104036
AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multi-dimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

T1  - Modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error
AN  - 1938113464
AB  - PurposeModern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets.Design/methodology/approachModern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n=183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n=409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires.FindingsIn Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.Originality/valueThis is one of the rare studies examining attitudes and conjunction error in a work-relevant context, thereby bridging the gap between social cognition and applied psychology.

T1  - Encountering Misrecognition: Being Mistaken for Being Muslim
AN  - 1904811374
AB  - Exploring both debates about misrecognition and explorations of encounters, this article focuses on the experiences of ethnic and religious minority young people who are mistaken for being Muslim in Scotland. We explore experiences of encountering misrecognition, including young people's understandings of, and responses to, such encounters. Recognizing how racism and religious discrimination operate to marginalize people-and how people manage and respond to this-is crucial in the struggle for social justice. Our focus is on young people from a diversity of ethnic and religious minority groups who are growing up in urban, suburban, and rural Scotland, 382 of whom participated in forty-five focus groups and 224 interviews. We found that young Sikhs, Hindus, and other south Asian young people as well as black and Caribbean young people were regularly mistaken for being Muslim. These encounters tended to take place at school, in taxis, at the airport, and in public spaces. Our analysis points to a dynamic set of interconnected issues shaping young people's experiences of misrecognition across a range of mediatized, geopoliticized, and educational spaces. Geopolitical events and their representation in the media, the homogenization of the south "Asian" community, and the lack of visibility offered to non-Muslim ethnic and religious minority groups all worked to construct our participants as "Muslims." Young people demonstrated agency and creativity in handling and responding to these encounters, including using humor, clarifying their religious affiliation, social withdrawal, and ignoring the situation. Redressing misrecognition requires institutional change to ensure parity of participation in society.

T1  - Making the "Other" from "Us": The Representation of British Converts to Islam in Mainstream British Newspapers
AN  - 1923037009
AB  - There is now a great deal of literature that shows how Islam and Muslims are routinely represented in negative ways in the mainstream newspapers. With overt or covert reliance on Orientalist discourse, discourses of cultural clash and extremism, including terror, are prevalent. Not only are Muslims less likely to feature in "normal" stories, abuse and prejudice against them is also more unlikely to constitute "news". British converts to Islam have only recently begun to receive more focused attention, both in academia and in the mainstream press. Occupying a unique position in respect to the idea of the "other" and of integration in a multicultural society, converts offer a powerful point of critique of these concepts. The aim of this study is to understand how and in what discourses British converts to Islam are represented, and thereby contribute empirical knowledge to these theoretical concerns.

T1  - Exploring representations of Black masculinity and emasculation on NBC's Parenthood
AN  - 2013187969
AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons ... bucks ... as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

T1  - Prayer, Protest, and Police Brutality: Black Muslim Spiritual Resistance in the Ferguson Era
AN  - 1907561495
AB  - This article is a localized ethnographic exploration of African American Muslims within the context of a broad and diverse national movement surrounding police violence and related issues of racial justice: "Black Lives Matter." Through fieldwork conducted simultaneously in physical spaces in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region of the United States and on social media platforms, this work explores some of the internal diversity of Black Lives Matter through a focus on the lived experiences of Black Muslims as they engage with the movement and their unique positioning in relationship with the issues it aims to address. Through attention to the ways that they are rendered doubly liminal and intersectionally impacted as a result of the prevalence of both anti-Black racism and Islamophobia, police violence as well as faith-based profiling and surveillance, I examine the fusion of spirituality and protest that informs the worship and activism of my interlocutors, the crafting of protest repertoires that draw upon the legacies of African American freedom struggles and Islamic mandates to social justice for the purposes of resisting, reimagining, and reshaping the marginalization that they experience.

T1  - Perceptions of diversity and attitudes of tolerance in the 'fragmented' U.K.
AN  - 2076973729
AB  - Relying on a quantitative survey (n = 1497) and semi-structured interviews (n = 30) conducted in the U.K., we explore British nationals', Romanian and Turkish migrants' attitudes of tolerance and the factors influencing them in the current socio-political context in the U.K. The quantitative data reveal the role of younger age, diverse networks, higher education, attachment to city/region and supranational identifications in more open attitudes towards diversity. The qualitative findings illustrate how diverse these three groups' attitudes of tolerance can be and how they are affected by their position and status in the U.K. The British' attitudes show their tolerance can reflect diverse forms of acceptance of ethnic and cultural differences but can also draw lines in terms of civic values opposing 'those who contribute to society' versus those who 'live as parasites'. The Turks are in favour of diversity with the expectation of receiving more civic rights and facing less prejudice. The Romanians tend to have a more ambiguous relation to diversity given their position of stigmatised migrants in the U.K. Our analysis reveal how inclusive or exclusive people's (sub- and supra-)national identities can be and how these frame their attitudes of tolerance.

T1  - Pictorial stereotypes and images in the Euro debt crisis
AN  - 1862143832
AB  - In the Euro debt crisis, it is hardly surprising that reciprocal stereotyping is carrying the day in the national media reviving old images of the respective 'other'. The study asks how covers of German news magazines are shaped by the use of national stereotypes and images when reporting about this crisis. The paper seeks to build a bridge between the seemingly distanced disciplines arts and political science by offering a lean framework for analysis. It uses some cover images taken from two German weeklies and modifies Panofsky's semiotic model revealing traditional stereotypes and images of Greece.

T1  - "It's not Pans, It's People": Student and Teacher Perspectives on Bisexuality and Pansexuality
AN  - 1877827860
AB  - This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity was more nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.

T1  - A critical discourse analytic approach to discursive construction of Islam in Western talk shows: The case of CNN talk shows: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1857961330
AB  - The present research aimed at examining the discourse of CNN as a mainstream media, through the application of critical discourse analysis. The goal of this research was to uncover CNN's orientation in covering Muslim-related issues and to uncover how the elements described by van Dijk (2001) play their role in constructing the discourses of Islamophobic ideologies in CNN's talk shows. To this end, an analysis was conducted at two textual and contextual levels, including 34 programs, out of 50 GPS talk shows aired in 2013. The textual analysis was done regarding the three levels of meaning, argumentation, and style and the contextual analysis with regards to levels of access and participants. The findings revealed that CNN's representation of Muslim-related issues was biased and stereotypical at all levels; textual and contextual and the scope of the talk show was in line with the Islamophobic ideologies which prevail the Western media today.

T1  - Language and linguistics on trial: Hearing Rachel Jeantel (and other vernacular speakers) in the courtroom and beyond
AN  - 2048126485
AB  - Rachel Jeantel was the leading prosecution witness when George Zimmerman was tried for killing Trayvon Martin, but she spoke in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and her crucial testimony was dismissed as incomprehensible and not credible. The disregard for her speech in court and the media is familiar to vernacular speakers and puts Linguistics itself on trial: following Saussure, how do we dispel such ‘prejudices’ and ‘fictions’? We show that Jeantel speaks a highly systematic AAVE, with possible Caribbean influence. We also discuss voice quality and other factors that bedeviled her testimony, including dialect unfamiliarity and institutionalized racism. Finally, we suggest strategies for linguists to help vernacular speakers be better heard in courtrooms and beyond.

T1  - Power, politics and the street-level bureaucrat in Indigenous Australian health
AN  - 1844787058
AB  - Street-level professional workers' influence over Indigenous health policy implementation is an important variable in a contested policy environment distinguished by an Indigenous median age of death approximately 20 years less than for non-Indigenous citizens. Street-level workers are guided by personal political values in the ways that they prioritise their work and make decisions about the care that will be available to particular patients. The possibility that street-level workers may make decisions with reference to stereotypical or prejudiced judgements about Indigenous peoples makes their bureaucratic discretion a point of particular significance. Alternatively, their capacity to work on the assumption that they have the professional agency and a moral duty to make a substantive contribution to improving Indigenous health outcomes positions their work in the context of social justice. The street-level worker is, then, drawn into the politics of public policy and policy activism, where ideology sits alongside professional knowledge and skills as determinants of Indigenous health outcomes, and where public policy's intellectual and practical inconsistencies simultaneously constrain opportunities for bureaucratic discretion in some respects and provide new opportunities in others, such that the street-level worker is a central participant in the politics of Indigenous health.

T1  - “You Need to Be Sorted Out With a Knife”: The Attempted Online Silencing of Women and People of Muslim Faith Within Academia
AN  - 2342302898
AB  - Academics are increasingly expected to use social media to disseminate their work and knowledge to public audiences. Although this has various advantages, particularly for alternative forms of dissemination, the web can also be an unsafe space for typically oppressed or subordinated groups. This article presents two auto-ethnographic accounts of the abuse and hate academics researching oppressed groups, namely, women and people of Muslim faith, experienced online. In doing so, this article falls into four parts. The first section provides an overview of existing literature, particularly focusing on work which explores the violence and abuse of women and people of Muslim faith online. The second section considers the auto-ethnographic methodological approach adopted in this article. The third section provides the auto-ethnographic accounts of the author’s experiences of hate and abuse online. The final section locates these experiences within broader theoretical concepts, such as silencing, and considers possible implications of such online hate in both an academic context and beyond.

T1  - Parenting Transgender Children in PFLAG
AN  - 1835699965
AB  - Parents of transgender children (N = 14) recounted four ways in which their parenting experiences were more difficult and isolating than those of other parents of a national GLBT support organization: the physical changes their children undergo, the lack of media representations of transgender lives, the effect of their child's gender transition on their identity as a parent, and the tensions involved in their child's successful transition in public settings. Parental isolation may be alleviated, however, by recognizing four unrecognized similarities shared among parents of GLBT children: adjusting to changes in their child's appearance, the process of grief and mourning, the tendency to hierarchically rank parental difficulties, and fears of being a bad parent. The isolation faced by parents of transgender children is imposed not only by antitrans prejudice and lack of information, but also by the unacknowledged and undiscussed ways in which a child's gender transition affects parental gender identities.

T1  - The legitimizing role of accent on discrimination against immigrants
AN  - 1833134649
AB  - This article analyses the influence of accent on discrimination against immigrants by examining the hypothesis that accent leads to discrimination only in more prejudiced individuals, merely because people speaking with a native accent are perceived to be better qualified than those whose accent is non-standard. In Study 1 (N=71), we found that only prejudiced individuals use accent to discriminate against immigrants. In Study 2 (N=124), we replicated this effect and found that the influence of accent on discrimination is mediated by the perceived quality of the accent. Study 3 (N=105) replicated the previous results even after controlling for the effect of stereotyping. These results are the first experimental illustration of the hypothesis that accent triggers intergroup discrimination only among prejudiced individuals because they evaluate native accents as being qualitatively better than accents of immigrants, thereby legitimizing ingroup bias.

T1  - "Why should I?": Adolescents' motivations to regulate prejudice in relation to their norm perceptions and ethnic attitudes
AN  - 1799877089
AB  - The present study examined native Dutch adolescents' motivations to regulate their out-group prejudice, and tested the relations with their ethnic attitudes and the perceived multicultural norms of their friends and parents. Three types of anti-prejudice motivation were assessed using a slightly adapted version of the Motivation to be Nonprejudiced Scale (MNPS; Legault et al., 2007): a strongly self-determined motivation (involving an intrinsic appreciation of out-groups and a personal endorsement of equality and out-group acceptance), a weakly self-determined motivation (including concerns with negative reactions from self and others), and amotivation (the absence of a clear motivation). Only the strongly self-determined motivation was consistently related to less negative ethnic attitudes, and it partly mediated the link between the perceived norms and these attitudes. The perceived norms of the friends were positively associated with the weakly self-determined motivation but the latter was not effective. Practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice Masquerading as Praise: The Negative Echo of Positive Stereotypes
AN  - 1797547560
AB  - Five studies demonstrate the powerful connection between being the target of a positive stereotype and expecting that one is also being ascribed negative stereotypes. In Study 1, women who heard a man state a positive stereotype were more likely to believe that he held negative stereotypes of them than women who heard no stereotype. Beliefs about being negatively stereotyped mediated the relationship between hearing a positive stereotype and believing that the stereotyper was prejudiced. Studies 2 to 4 extended these results to Asian Americans and accounted for alternative explanations (e.g., categorization threat). In Study 5, the same positive stereotype (e.g., good at math) was directed to Asian American men's racial or gender identity. Their perceptions about whether negative racial or gender stereotypes were being applied to them depended on the identity referenced by the positive stereotype. Positive stereotypes signal a latent negativity about one's group, thereby explaining why they can feel like prejudice.

AN  - 2539303784
AB  - Im Seen but Seldom Heard-Projekt, in der performativen Sozialwissenschaft (PSS) angesiedelt, wurde performative Dichtung genutzt zum Nachvollzug der Erfahrungen junger Menschen mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen. Zwei Dichter, eine Gruppe Jugendlicher und Wissenschaftler/innen aus den Sozial- sowie Medien- und Kommunikationswissenschaften suchten in der gemeinsamen Arbeit nach einem besseren Verstehen von Identität, Stereotypen, Stigma und Repräsentation. In diesem Beitrag geben wir einen Überblick über die Projektarbeit und zeigen, wie PSS angewendet werden kann, um sonst schwer zugängliche Stimmen hörbar zu machen. Wir veranschaulichen dies an zwei Gedichten, die Einblick in das Leben mit körperlichen Beeinträchtigungen gewähren und die den Jugendlichen halfen, das eigene Verständnis von Behinderung und Diskriminierung zu reflektieren.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:The Seen but Seldom Heard project was a performative social science (PSS) project which used performance poetry to illuminate the experiences of young people with physical impairments.

In this article, we will present an overview of the project and consider how PSS offers a method to engage seldom heard voices, and illustrate this through two poems which shed light on the lived experience of disability. The article will consider the impact of these poems as PSS, and how this method allows the audience to develop a deeper understanding of the "lived" experience of disability and to reflect upon their own understandings of disability and discrimination.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1602118Alternate abstract:El proyecto "Visto pero rara vez oído" [Seen but Seldom Heard] fue un proyecto de ciencia social performativa (CSP) que utilizó la poesía performativa para clarificar las experiencias de jóvenes con impedimentos físicos.

T1  - Overarching findings
AN  - 1863793839
AB  - The issue of racism in the Australian Football League (AFL) is one that has been officially recognized since 1995. Since then, the AFL, the AFL Players Association (AFLPA) and the AFL clubs have been bound by the rules of the code, specifically Rule 35, to deal with racism, racial and religious intolerance and racist abuse, as well as other forms of vilification, when it has arisen. The most recent player-to-player vilification incident occurred in 2011 and involved Western Bulldogs forward Justin Sherman and Gold Coast Sun defender Joel Wilkinson. Despite the problems that many had with Sherman’s suspension, which still allowed him to play with the Western reserves side, what was very marked was the speed of the process from the lodgement of complaint to the suspension. This would seem to indicate that when it comes to such matters, the AFL is serious about dealing with racial vilification and it wanted to send a message to all the clubs and players. In the weeks and months after the incident, what become quite evident was the damage Sherman has sustained to his reputation as a professional athlete: his ‘brand’ is tarnished from here on. Furthermore, the overarching message from this incident as it related to the AFL was that racism in any form is wrong and it will not be tolerated. The main aims of this project were to assess the ways that AFL players have engaged with the education programmes and professional development offered, and how they understand issues of race, racism, ethnicity and difference within the professional environment of elite football in the AFL, and by association, the everyday. The reason for this is the length of time that has passed since Michael Long made his stance in 1995 and the resources that have gone into educating the players on these matters. What this book is seeking to provide is an understanding of the efficacy of those programmes in educating professional elite athletes about racial and religious issues within the AFL and also the athletes’ everyday lives and extended communities. This is important given that the AFL has become an international and national leader on this issue and its corporate and community standing is heavily connected to by Rule 35 and its associated programmes.

T1  - The Post-Racial Society is here
AN  - 1925690461
AB  - Since state-sanctioned racism has effectively been outlawed, Rich contends, we already have a post-racial society, and the media's emphasis on racial strife compounds our own failure to recognize this.In this complex and contemporary examination of American cultural attitudes toward race, Rich offers a series of lectures and essays that situate his topic in an historical timeline.In making his case that Americans resist the idea that we are already living in a post-racial society because of a focus on residual attitudes, Rich provides a useful generational structure for readers to consider.Furthermore, the current generation of Americans does not find race-based attitudes attractive, so the leaders of tomorrow will approach the future from a standpoint that does not include old prejudices.In summary, The Post-Racial Society Is Here by Wilbur C. Rich offers a compelling argument as to why Americans must recognize and embrace a cultural shift that, he contends, has already occurred.

T1  - Muslim 'hate preachers' in British tabloids: Constructing the British self and the Muslim other
AN  - 1811948619
AB  - In the aftermath of 9/11, the academia witnessed a surge in the number of studies dealing with Islamophobia, the representations of Muslims in Western media and complex realities created by such (mis)representations. This article hopes to contribute to such scholarly efforts by examining the demonisation of Islam through the fashioning of celebrity Muslim 'hate preachers' (i.e. Abu-Hamza, Abu-Qatada and Omar Bakri) in British tabloids (i.e. The Sun and the Daily Mail ). Drawing upon insights from Serge Moscovici's theory of social representations, the article aims to diverge from the traditional approaches of content and discourse analysis to shed light on the nexus between forms of social thinking and the unique portrayal of these preachers in tabloids.

T1  - Trusting Communities and Bigger In-Groups: Social Capital, Interracial Contact Climate, and Common In-Group Categorization
AN  - 1750356044
AB  - Contact with members of different groups can reduce prejudice and encourage people to recategorize members of other social categories. This research examines individual-level social capital--one's experience with trust, reciprocity norms, and engagement within a given community--as a construct that predicts contact climate and recategorization. People who have high levels of social capital within a community are more likely to perceive a positive interracial contact climate. High social capital and a favorable contact climate can encourage people to focus on their shared identity as members of that community. Two studies support the claim that social capital predicts intergroup processes. Study 1 tests a cross-sectional mediation model linking individual-level social capital to perceptions of the contact climate, common in-group categorization, and racial out-group attitudes. Study 2 presents longitudinal data demonstrating that social capital's cross-lagged effects on contact climate, categorization, and racial out-group attitudes are stronger than their reverse effects. Implications for diversity research and community applications are discussed.

T1  - Attachment security and intergroup contact
AN  - 1727469495
AB  - The contact hypothesis suggests that the interaction between members of different groups decreases prejudice. Moderators and mediators shaping this link have been investigated. However, research about the factors that facilitate contact is not frequent. This article examines secure attachment as an antecedent of contact. Three studies provide information about various aspects of the relationship between secure attachment and contact: security is positively associated with (a) intergroup contact, which in turn is related to reduced prejudice (Study 1); (b) implicit approach tendencies toward the outgroup (Study 2); and, once again, (c) with contact through the indirect effect of openness to exploration (Study 3). In the discussion, we recommend priming both secure and insecure schemas to investigate their unique effects on intergroup contact.

T1  - Cutting Gordian Knots: Reducing Prejudice Through Attachment Security
AN  - 1725035918
AB  - The positive role of secure attachment in reducing intergroup biases has been suggested in prior studies. We extend this work by testing the effects of secure attachment primes on negative emotions and aggressive behaviors toward outgroup members across four experiments. Results from Studies 1A and 1B reveal that secure attachment prime, relative to neutral, can reduce negative outgroup emotions. In addition, Studies 1B and 3 results rule out positive mood increase as an alternative explanation for the observed effects. Results from Studies 2 and 3 reveal that secure attachment primes can reduce aggressive behavior toward an outgroup member. The effect of secure attachment primes on outgroup harm was found to be fully mediated by negative emotions in Studies 2 and 3. An interaction between secure attachment primes and ingroup identification in Study 2 indicated that the positive effects of secure attachment in reducing outgroup harm may be especially beneficial for highly identified ingroup members.

T1  - The Social Media Political Subject Is an Infant
AN  - 2343062754
AB  - Any random sampling of a Facebook timeline or Twitter feed, to take the obvious examples, provides a prepackaged view of global politics. It is restrictive because we choose it to reflect our own pet subjects, groups, likes, and world interests. The lens is prejudiced to reflect our race, class, gender, sexuality, ideology, and affective positionality. We enter a social media world as many as 10 or 50 times a day that has ourselves as the center of the universe. This communication world is similar to an infant’s world: Someone else decides what we can see, what we can consume, what is that extra treat we can earn, if we are good: in social media terms, if we pay for it by reputational capital, or simply, if we spend enough money.

T1  - Intervening in the Media's Influence on Stereotypes of Race and Ethnicity: The Role of Media Literacy Education
AN  - 1662632097
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Racial resentment and smoking
AN  - 1738477081; 201539201
AB  - Racial resentment (also known as symbolic racism) is among the most widely tested measures of contemporary prejudice in political science and social psychological research over the past thirty years. Proponents argue that racial resentment reflects anti-black emotion obtained through pre-adult socialization. In light of affect-based models of substance use, this paper examined the association between racial resentment and smoking in a national sample of non-Hispanic white, black, and Hispanic respondents. Data come from the 2012 American National Election Study, which contained two measures of smoking. The results of ordinal logistic regression models indicate a positive association between racial resentment and smoking among non-Hispanic whites (N = 2133) that is not present among blacks (N = 693) or Hispanics (N = 660). Models controlled for age, education, income, gender, political ideology, region, and mode of interview. Furthermore, analyses indicated that a measure of race-related affect, admiration and sympathy towards blacks, partially mediated the association between racial resentment and smoking. For non-Hispanic whites, racial resentment appears to constitute a risk factor for smoking. Future studies should further specify the conditions linking substance use to the race-related affective component of racial resentment. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - “The White Space”
AN  - 2406941943
AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as “the white space,” which they often consider to be informally “off limits” for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news—the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

T1  - Rio de Janeiro and the divided state: Analysing the political discourse on favelas
AN  - 1738476977; 201538763
AB  - This article analyses the discourse on favelas produced by Brazilian society and consumed in the political field of local administration. The ideological conception of favelas (slums) determines the creation of public policies that reinforce the prejudicial notion of favelas. This work employs critical discourse analysis (CDA) to analyse several texts extracted from mass-media stories and press releases of the Rio government. It shows that the state of praxis reproduces the understanding of slums as a phenomenon detached from the rest of society. This alienated vision impacts on different utterances blaming the poor (analysis 1); perpetuating poverty (analysis 2); and reinforcing exclusion (analysis 3).

T1  - Muslim-Buddhist Conflict in Contemporary Sri Lanka
AN  - 1708527393; 201529516
AB  - The end of the civil war in 2009 heralded hope that a new era of peace and inter-ethnic cooperation might be possible in post-war Sri Lanka. This hope now seems, at best, mere wishful thinking, as this article highlights an emerging conflict between the Sinhalese Buddhist majority and Sri Lankan Muslims. Through detailed analysis of online social data, argued evidence is provided that Muslim Sri Lankans are now at the receiving end of Islamaphobic rhetoric, even violence, from Sinhala Buddhist nationalist organisations, driven by a belief that the Muslim community represent a threat to Buddhism. The article suggests that Sinhala nationalists have skilfully adopted new internet technologies which have proved effective in their anti-Muslim campaigns. It becomes necessary to conclude that these attacks on Muslim minorities are an extension of pre-existing oppression patterns faced by other minorities residing on the island, particularly Tamils. Indeed, the rhetoric behind these attacks bears a striking resemblance to the type of nationalist discourse found during the Sri Lankan civil war.

T1  - Japanese marriage migrants in 'imagined' multicultural Australia: Facing gaps between expectation and reality
AN  - 1664807807
AB  - This article uses qualitative data to explore Japanese marriage migrants' preconceptions of Australia prior to their emigration to Queensland. In particular, it focuses on two dominant images of Australia: its natural environment and its multicultural society. I argue that the preconceived images accord with Japanese media representations of Australia, providing examples of cultural texts that reflect such images. Second, I highlight the disparity between anticipated settlement experiences influenced by preconceived images of Australia and actual lived experience. In Japanese migrants' imagination, multicultural Australia has no racial prejudice or discrimination, and therefore they do not expect to encounter any. However, some migrants have faced adverse experiences that ultimately contest the preconceived image of a harmonious Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and some informants avoided discussing racist experiences and some even adopted a defensive attitude. This article lastly explores why some participants find it difficult to share their negative experiences. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ambivalent Sexism and Religion: Connected Through Values
AN  - 1680151979; 201517807
AB  - Sexist attitudes do not exist in a limbo; they are embedded in larger belief systems associated with specific hierarchies of values. In particular, manifestations of benevolent sexism (Glick and Fiske 1996, 1997, 2001) can be perceived as a social boon, not a social ill, both because they are experienced as positive, and because they reward behaviors that maintain social stability. One of the strongest social institutions that create and justify specific hierarchies of values is religion. In this paper, we examine how the values inherent in religious beliefs (perhaps inadvertently) propagate an unequal status quo between men and women through endorsement of ideologies linked to benevolent sexism. In a survey with a convenience sample of train passengers in Southern and Eastern Poland (N=180), we investigated the relationship between Catholic religiosity and sexist attitudes. In line with previous findings (Gaunt 2012; Glick et al. 2002a; Tasdemir and Sakall(dotless i)-Uurlu 2010), results suggest that religiosity can be linked to endorsement of benevolent sexism. This relationship was mediated in our study by the values of conservatism and openness to change (Schwartz 1992): religious individuals appear to value the societal status quo, tradition, and conformity, which leads them to perceive women through the lens of traditional social roles. Adhering to the teachings of a religion that promotes family values in general seems to have as its byproduct an espousal of prejudicial attitudes toward specific members of the family.

T1  - Informed consent for sterilisation of women and girls with disabilities in the light of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
AN  - 1559005804; 201432122
AB  - In South Africa, as indeed around the world, systematic prejudice and discrimination continues to result in women and girls with disabilities having their right to experience their sexuality, to have sexual relationships and found and maintain families violated. There have been anecdotal reports in KwaZulu-Natal of parents and guardians of pubescent girls and women with disabilities giving consent for the sterilisation of these girls and women based on stereotypical notions of sexuality, parenthood, challenges with sanitation and menstruation periods, sexual abuse and myths about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. This Article is aimed at identifying the stereotypical beliefs and attitudes towards parenting, sexuality and reproductive choices that make women with disabilities more likely to be involuntarily sterilised than non-disabled women. It is also aimed at illustrating the problems in South African legislation dealing with sterilisation and the inaction of government tasked with implementing sexual reproductive health policies. The author interrogates whether or not the amended Sterilisation Act 4 of 1998 meets the state's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and whether it promotes the rights of women to freedom of the person and bodily integrity, equality and dignity under the South African Constitution. It is argued that the legal capacity of women with disabilities must be uncoupled from their sexuality, fertility and reproductive capacity to ensure that the agency of women with disabilities to make their own reproductive decisions is recognised. This will require demystifying the sexuality of women with disabilities, through policy, advocacy and media efforts, but also through careful law reform measures to enhance their autonomy in decision-making about reproduction, particularly to ensure South Africa's Sterilisation Act (as amended) is in line with the Constitution and the state's obligations under the CRPD. Recommendations for law reform are made in this regard. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religiosity and Prejudice: Different Patterns for Two Types of Religious Internalization
AN  - 1559005075; 201431767
AB  - The literature on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice has shown inconsistent findings. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of religiosity and that its relationship with prejudice is mediated by different values. Results of two studies conducted in Italy show that identified religiosity and introjected religiosity predict different levels of prejudice toward Muslim immigrants. Moreover, the negative relationship between identified religiosity and prejudice was mediated by prosocial values, whereas valuing conformity mediated the positive relationship between introjected religiosity and prejudice. The results show that it is possible to better understand the relationship between religiosity and prejudice by disentangling the different ways of being religious. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Who opposes rights for persons with physical and intellectual disabilities?
AN  - 1433108442
AB  - Research on human and civil rights has only rarely addressed people's attitudes toward disability rights in the context of American society. This study was designed to gain a better understanding of why certain individuals might oppose expanded rights for people who have disabilities. Pearson's correlations revealed that individuals high on social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) were more likely to reject rights for persons with intellectual and physical disabilities than individuals scoring lower on these factors. Structural equation analyses indicated that both SDO and RWA are directly implicated in opposition to expanded rights for these groups. Moreover, the effects of SDO on rights attitudes appear to be mediated through internal motivation to respond without prejudice.

T1  - Influenza stigma during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
AN  - 1433108439
AB  - The current study examined the extent to which H1N1 was stigmatized at the height of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the U.S. and explored the role that H1N1 stigma played in people's desire for physical distance from others with H1N1. H1N1 was the most stigmatized disease, with participants endorsing greater prejudice toward people with H1N1 than people with cancer or HIV/AIDS. Further, H1N1 stigma partially mediated the relationship between participants' perceptions that H1N1 was threatening and their desire for physical distance from people with H1N1. Therefore, H1N1 stigma played a role in, but was not entirely responsible for, the relationship between perceptions that H1N1 was threatening and the desire for distance from others with H1N1.

AB  - This paper re-assesses the significance of the idea of 'right' in the tradition of critical theory. Focusing on the work of Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno, especially their confrontation with totalitarianism, it addresses their conceptualization of rights, their engagement with the philosophies of right created by Kant and Hegel, and the ambivalent place of Marx in their thinking about rights. My argument is that critical theory turned to natural rights in response to the perceived difficulties positive sociology had in confronting the barbarities of fascism and Stalinism. Critical theory steered a path between philosophies of right that acknowledged the idea of right within an unacceptably naturalistic frame of reference, and a sociological consciousness that de-natured the idea of right at the cost of its devaluation. Arendt and Adorno both confronted the contradictions of an age in which the rights of the individual were elevated as a supreme value while individuality was subjected to the forces of technological and economic determination. Both understood the barbarism of their times in terms of the disintegration of mediations between freedom and determination. Both recognized the gulf that separates the concept of rights from the material interests, inequalities and prejudices concealed behind them. And both drew on the critical substance of natural right theory to distinguish between the critique of rights, which has as its end their revaluation , and the trashing of rights, which serves to reinforce their devaluation . I argue that there is much to be gained, in terms of our understanding both of rights and of critique, from critical theory's engagement with the natural law tradition.

T1  - Coping with HIV Related Stigma and Well-Being
AN  - 1448994997; 201342730
AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the relationships to be found among stigma perception, active and avoidant coping strategies, and subjective and psychological well-being in a sample of 133 people with HIV. The results showed that stigma perception and avoidant coping strategies (venting, self-blame, denial, behavioural disengagement and substance use) were positively associated, whereas, both stigma perception and avoidant coping were negatively associated with different measures of well-being (affect balance, self-acceptance and environmental mastery). These negative relationships between stigma perception and the three well-being measures were mediated by the use of avoidant coping strategies. Results suggest that psychosocial intervention programs for people who report psychological distress arising from prejudice must be aimed at developing appropriate ways to deal with this prejudice. Intervention programs should also include strategies to directly increase well-being since from a positive psychology viewpoint certain interventions have been shown to do so, and HIV research has also shown that well-being is associated with lower mortality rates.

T1  - The horror at Fort Hood: disseminating American exceptionalism
AN  - 1494749788; 201402957
AB  - American exceptionalism -- the constitutive myth of American national identity -- has been disseminated through literature, film, and foreign policy. This article analyzes another site: online comments in response to the New York Times coverage of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. It is a site in which citizens participate in myth-making and maintenance. This article makes two broad claims. First, that readers' comments in response to the Fort Hood shootings constitute messages about American national identity, particularly American exceptionalism vis-a-vis the military -- the military-idea, the symbol of a unified, coherent force is central to the myth of American exceptionalism. Second, events considered to be failures of the military threaten the coherence of American exceptionalism (by fracturing the military-idea). The Fort Hood incident was considered such a failure and one readers identified as part of a larger problematic involving the US's post-9/11 'war on terror'. In this mediated activity, readers put various discourses (e.g. Islamophobia, mental illness) into service to account for the military's failure and thus maintain the myth of American exceptionalism. Ultimately, these communications constitute an attempt to avoid the divisive consequences of 'another Vietnam', to which the US's post-9/11 military operations are increasingly compared.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons
AN  - 1364703922; 201327807
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Why Can't You Control Yourself?" Fat Should Be a Feminist Issue
AN  - 958726616
AB  - This article is a comment on Fikkan and Rothblum's (2011) article "Is Fat a Feminist Issue? Exploring the Gendered Nature of Weight Bias." They argued that fat women in North America experience significantly more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do, marshaled evidence to support their argument in several domains (e.g., employment, education, romantic relationships, health care, the media), and wondered why feminist scholars have not paid much attention to the oppression of fat women. Here I suggest several reasons why fat women experience more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do: the objectification of women, gender-related aspects of health behavior and knowledge about health and illness, and the importance of self-control to the performance of femininity. I also suggest that there is some overlap in negative stereotypes of both feminists and fat women, which might lead to a desire to distance oneself from both. However, feminists should recognize the intersectionality of fat oppression and the way it colludes with the sexualization and objectification of women in popular culture. Thus, fat should be a feminist issue.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Functions of Symbolic Racism
AN  - 930147581
AB  - Symbolic racism (SR) has attracted critique and controversy. One controversy that has remained unresolved is the function of SR. SR theorists suggest that SR originates from Black individualism and represents a new form of racism. Others suggest that SR originates in opposition to equality and serves to legitimize these socially inappropriate attitudes. The current paper argues that SR can arise from both Black individualism and anti-equality attitudes, thus serving both as a new expression of racism but also as a legitimizing ideology. A preliminary test of this hybrid model was examined with survey data from a community and university sample. Results suggest that a hybrid model of the underpinnings of SR explains more variance in SR than either the Black individualism or legitimizing ideology models. Furthermore, SR mediated the relationships between both anti-equality attitudes and Black individualism on opposition to affirmative action policy and diversity in work and education settings.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Vicarious Moral Licensing: The Influence of Others' Past Moral Actions on Moral Behavior
AN  - 914768163; 201200104
AB  - This article investigates the effect of others' prior nonprejudiced behavior on an individual's subsequent behavior. Five studies supported the hypothesis that people are more willing to express prejudiced attitudes when their group members' past behavior has established nonprejudiced credentials. Study 1a showed that participants who were told that their group was more moral than similar other groups were more willing to describe a job as better suited for Whites than for African Americans. In Study 1b, when given information on group members' prior nondiscriminatory behavior (selecting a Hispanic applicant in a prior task), participants subsequently gave more discriminatory ratings to the Hispanic applicant for a position stereotypically suited for majority members (Whites). In Study 2, moral self-concept mediated the effect of others' prior nonprejudiced actions on a participant's subsequent prejudiced behavior such that others' past nonprejudiced actions enhanced the participant's moral self-concept, and this inflated moral self-concept subsequently drove the participant's prejudiced ratings of a Hispanic applicant. In Study 3, the moderating role of identification with the credentialing group was tested. Results showed that participants expressed more prejudiced attitudes toward a Hispanic applicant when they highly identified with the group members behaving in nonprejudiced manner. In Study 4, the credentialing task was dissociated from the participants' own judgmental task, and, in addition, identification with the credentialing group was manipulated rather than measured. Consistent with prior studies, the results showed that participants who first had the opportunity to view an in-group member's nonprejudiced hiring decision were more likely to reject an African American man for a job stereotypically suited for majority members. These studies suggest a vicarious moral licensing effect. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Internalized Sexual Minority Stressors and Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 1030864651; 201230056
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious problem in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships. Although there are numerous similarities in the dynamics of IPV, gay men and lesbians experience unique stressors related to their sexual minority status. This preliminary, descriptive study examined the relationship among internalized homophobia, stigma consciousness, and openness to self-reported IPV victimization and perpetration. Among 581 men and lesbians, approximately one-quarter reported IPV victimization and almost 10% reported IPV perpetration. When demographic variables of age, sex of participant, and relationship status were controlled, victims of IPV reported greater expectations of prejudice and discrimination, yet were more open about their sexual orientation. Similarly, expectations of prejudice and discrimination were related to IPV perpetration. As researchers and counselors focus on understanding, and ultimately reducing, same-sex IPV, it is imperative that sexual minority stressors are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "We'd Be Free": Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or Sexism
AN  - 1221412117; 201245930
AB  - Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities.

T1  - "What I wanted to do was..." Discrepancies Between College Women's Desired and Reported Responses to Gender Prejudice
AN  - 1081860650; 201237948
AB  - When experiencing gender prejudice, college women engage in a dynamic decision making process about whether and how to respond. We examined the discrepancy between how college women wanted to respond and how they actually responded to gender prejudice events and explored their reasons for not using a desired response. In this study, 81 college women from the Western United States responded to a qualitative online daily diary about gender prejudice. In 34% (N=265) of the events, the women reported there was a discrepancy between what they wanted to do and how they actually reacted, with the most common discrepancy being a desire to utilize a confrontational response (91%, N=242). Over the two week period, women reported significantly more events during which they considered the use of a confrontational response (N=242) than they actually used one (N=199). Women's reported reasons for not using their desired response included: not being cost effective (25%), concern about social norms (37%), setting limitations (19%), personality characteristics (9%) and not being bothered enough by the event (10%). We also found that when women considered using a confrontational response but decided not to, they reported using all other response types instead. In these cases, women who did nothing during the event reported lower levels of distress during the event than women who used a psychological response or a different confrontational response. Implications and future research directions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Dual Process Motivational Model of Ambivalent Sexism and Gender Differences in Romantic Partner Preferences
AN  - 1125223523; 201242516
AB  - We tested a dual process motivational model of ambivalent sexism and gender differences in intimate partner preferences. Meta-analysis of 32 samples (16 with men, 16 with women; N = 5,459) indicated that Benevolent Sexism (BS) in women was associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners (r = 0.24), whereas Hostile Sexism (HS) in men was associated with stronger preferences for physically attractive partners (r = 0.20). Study 2 examined the ideological correlates of this gender difference (N = 249 men, 243 women). For women, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was associated with greater preferences for high-resource partners, mediated by BS. For men, Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) was associated with greater preferences for attractive partners, mediated by HS. These findings indicate that women's desire for high-resource partners is related to a protection and security-provision motive, whereas men's desire for attractive partners is related to a dominance-based status-marker motive. Gender differences in these dual motives have implications for understanding the reciprocal reinforcement of gender inequality. We argue that they exacerbate gender inequality by decreasing women's immediate motivation for direct access to resources (because they may be provided for by men) and promoting instead goals in women relating to the maintenance of an attractive appearance valued by men.

T1  - Sexual Orientation, Parental Support, and Health During the Transition to Young Adulthood
AN  - 746772403; 20383570
AB  - Some recent studies suggest that sexual minorities may have worse health-related outcomes during adolescence because they report lower levels of family connectedness, a key protective resource. Using data from wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 11,153; 50.6% female; mean age = 21.8 years), this study extends prior research on adolescents to young adults. We examine whether lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) young adults report lower levels of parental support than their heterosexual peers and whether differences in parental support help explain why LGB young adults tend to have worse health-related outcomes. We find that lesbian and bisexual women report lower levels of parental support than heterosexual women and that gay men report lower levels of parental support than bisexual and heterosexual men. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women have higher odds of suicidal thoughts and recent drug use; bisexual women also have higher odds of elevated depressive symptomatology and heavy drinking. Gay men have higher odds of suicidal thoughts than heterosexual men. With the exception of heavy drinking, parental support either partially or fully mediates each of the observed associations. Even though the transition from adolescence to young adulthood is characterized by increased independence from parents, parental support remains an important correlate of health-related outcomes during this stage of life. Sexual minorities report lower levels of parental support during young adulthood, which helps explain why they have worse health-related outcomes. Interventions designed to strengthen relationships between LGB young adults and their parents could lead to a reduction in health disparities related to sexual orientation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Experiences of Racial Discrimination & Relation to Violence Perpetration and Gang Involvement among a sample of Urban African American Men
AN  - 199567075; 18553221
AB  - Objective To examine racial discrimination and its relation to violence involvement among a sample of urban African American men. Methods Participants of this cross-sectional study were African American men (N = 703) between the ages of 18 and 65 years, recruited from four urban community health centers and two hospital-based clinics within an urban center in the Northeast. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the relation of reported racial discrimination to recent perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV), street violence involvement, and gang involvement. Racial discrimination was measured via 7 items assessing everyday and lifetime experiences of racial discrimination. Results In logistic regression models adjusted for age and homelessness, men reporting high levels of discrimination (scores above the sample median) were significantly more likely to report IPV perpetration (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.9; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.2-2.9) and street violence involvement (AOR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.2) as compared to men reporting lower levels of discrimination. No relation was found between experiencing discrimination and gang involvement. Conclusions Findings showcase the potential relevance of racial discrimination to efforts focused on reducing racial disparities related to violence.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Attitudes Toward Homosexuals Among Youth in Multiethnic Brussels
AN  - 1928193135
AB  - This study examined attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (referred to in the literature as sexual prejudice ) in a sample of pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels. We used items measuring traditional and modern sexual prejudice and support for gay civil rights. We performed a multilevel linear multivariate response analysis to assess both the impact of individual characteristics and school influence on pupils' attitudes. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, second-generation migrants had more prejudice toward homosexuals than pupils from the ethnic majority group. Identification with the receiving society and perception of group-level institutional discrimination, however, mediated the association between ethnic origin and homonegativity. In contrast to traditional sexual prejudice and gay civil rights issues, modern sexual prejudice items were less affected by individual sociodemographic variables. Modern sexual prejudice also remained rather stable across schools; however, schools did appear to affect civil rights issues and traditional sexual prejudice. This contribution sheds light on the relationship between ethnic origin and sexual prejudice and on the variation of several sexual prejudice dimensions across social groups and schools.

T1  - Till Death Us Do Part and the BBC: Racial Politics and the British Working Classes 1965-75
AN  - 1978060690
AB  - Historians have struggled to unpick the complex relationship between the British working classes and heightened Commonwealth immigration to postwar Britain and have tended to explain the development of racial politics in this period in terms of the agenda of the Conservative Party and broader forces of the political right. Within this historical analysis, Labour's position has been less clear. This article argues that an analysis of Johnny Speight's BBC comedy series Till Death Us Do Part informs historical discussion about changing racial sensibilities within the Labour Party and its working-class constituencies.Till Death Us Do Part was one of the most popular and controversial programmes of its generation. The story focused on the working-class Garnett family and specifically on the anti-hero Alf Garnett, played by Warren Mitchell. Speight claimed that he utilized this character to explode popular prejudices and attack the British class system. Whilst the relationship between Speight and his character was somewhat more complicated, this article argues that Till Death Us Do Part does offer critical insight into the political and social dynamics of the British working classes and ultimately can enhance historical understanding of British race relations in this period.
