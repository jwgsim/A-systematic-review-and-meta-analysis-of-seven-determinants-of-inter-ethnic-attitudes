T1  - Neoliberal representations of Muslims and the Islamic world: a discourse analysis of imaginative geographies in Brazilian local and regional print media
AN  - 2695623042
AB  - Since 9/11, representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in Western mass media have received much scholarly attention, not least because such representations influence how Muslims are perceived by and integrated into Western societies. Most existing studies have shown that Muslims and Islam tend to be framed negatively through orientalist and Islamophobic discourses. However, this paper argues that in specific contexts, neoliberal ideology has generated mass-media representations of Muslims and the Islamic world that differ from orientalist versions. In contexts relating to the globalised halal market, for example, neoliberal discourses portray Muslims and the Islamic world as economically useful and/or exploitable rather than culturally threatening. This argument is supported by an analysis of representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in local and regional newspapers in Brazil, one of the largest halal meat and poultry exporters in the world. Drawing on theories of neoliberalism, a discourse theoretical approach and the notion of imaginative geographies, the study examines newspaper articles on the halal business. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that scholars should subject neoliberal ideology (and its interaction with orientalism and Islamophobia) to greater scrutiny in future research on representations of Muslims and the Islamic world.

T1  - Online interventions for reducing hate speech and cyberhate: A systematic review
AN  - 2676551114
AB  - BackgroundThe unique feature of the Internet is that individual negative attitudes toward minoritized and racialized groups and more extreme, hateful ideologies can find their way onto specific platforms and instantly connect people sharing similar prejudices. The enormous frequency of hate speech/cyberhate within online environments creates a sense of normalcy about hatred and the potential for acts of intergroup violence or political radicalization. While there is some evidence of effective interventions to counter hate speech through television, radio, youth conferences, and text messaging campaigns, interventions for online hate speech have only recently emerged.ObjectivesThis review aimed to assess the effects of online interventions to reduce online hate speech/cyberhate.Search MethodsWe systematically searched 2 database aggregators, 36 individual databases, 6 individual journals, and 34 websites, as well as bibliographies of published reviews of related literature, and scrutiny of annotated bibliographies of related literature.Inclusion CriteriaWe included randomized and rigorous quasi‐experimental studies of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions that measured the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online and included a control group. Eligible populations included youth (10–17 years) and adult (18+ years) participants of any racial/ethnic background, religious affiliation, gender identity, sexual orientation, nationality, or citizenship status.Data Collection and AnalysisThe systematic search covered January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2020, with searches conducted between August 19, 2020 and December 31, 2020, and supplementary searches undertaken between March 17 and 24, 2022. We coded characteristics of the intervention, sample, outcomes, and research methods. We extracted quantitative findings in the form of a standardized mean difference effect size. We computed a meta‐analysis on two independent effect sizes.Main ResultsTwo studies were included in the meta‐analysis, one of which had three treatment arms. For the purposes of the meta‐analysis we chose the treatment arm from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study that most closely aligned with the treatment condition in the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study. However, we also present additional single effect sizes for the other treatment arms from the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study. Both studies evaluated the effectiveness of an online intervention for reducing online hate speech/cyberhate. The Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study had a sample size of 1570 subjects, while the Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study had a sample size of 1469 tweets (nested in 180 subjects). The mean effect was small (g = −0.134, 95% confidence interval [−0.321, −0.054]). Each study was assessed for risk of bias on the following domains: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported results. Both studies were rated as “low risk” on the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, and measurement of the outcome domains. We assessed the Bodine‐Baron et al. (2020) study as “some” risk of bias regarding missing outcome data and “high risk” for selective outcome reporting bias. The Álvarez‐Benjumea and Winter (2018) study was rated as “some concern” for the selective outcome reporting bias domain.Authors' ConclusionsThe evidence is insufficient to determine the effectiveness of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions for reducing the creation and/or consumption of hateful content online. Gaps in the evaluation literature include the lack of experimental (random assignment) and quasi‐experimental evaluations of online hate speech/cyberhate interventions, addressing the creation and/or consumption of hate speech as opposed to the accuracy of detection/classification software, and assessing heterogeneity among subjects by including both extremist and non‐extremist individuals in future intervention studies. We provide suggestions for how future research on online hate speech/cyberhate interventions can fill these gaps moving forward.

T1  - Mobile application for couple relationships: Results of a pilot effectiveness study
AN  - 2672498582
AB  - Mobile apps in mental health have seen a significant growth in recent years. Most of them are aimed at treating depression, anxiety, and stress disorders using cognitive behavioural therapy methods and relatively few apps are being developed to address interpersonal issues. This study tested the effectiveness of the iCognito Relationship Program, a self‐help application for couple relationships based on the chatbot technology. A between‐group experimental study was conducted in Russia using the bibliotherapy as a control condition (N = 58, female sample), with results showing that, after 2 weeks, iCognito's users had increased satisfaction, tenderness, constructive communication, as well as commitment to the relationship. Also, indicators for relationship self‐efficacy, communicative skills in relationships, and self‐esteem regarding relationship skills had significantly increased, while level of conflicts had decreased. A medium effect size was reported for most indicators. The participants of an experimental group expressed a high level of satisfaction with the technology and a generally positive attitude towards the idea of working with a “virtual psychologist”‐chatbot on their personal issues. Despite the need to reproduce the research results, iCognito program demonstrates that both mobile application and chatbot technologies can be useful for training individuals’ relationship satisfaction and communication skills, and that they can be more efficient in increasing satisfaction and reducing conflict in relationships than self‐help books.Alternate abstract:En los últimos años, las aplicaciones móviles en la salud mental han crecido considerablemente. La mayoría están orientadas a tratar trastornos de depresión, ansiedad y estrés usando métodos de la terapia cognitivo‐conductual, pero se están desarrollando relativamente pocas aplicaciones para abordar problemas interpersonales. En este estudio se evaluó la eficacia de la iCognito Relationship Program, una aplicación de autoayuda para las relaciones de pareja basada en la tecnología de bots de charla. Se realizó un estudio experimental intergrupal en Rusia usando la biblioterapia como condición de control (N = 58, muestra femenina), cuyos resultados demostraron que, después de 2 semanas, los usuarios de iCognito habían aumentado la satisfacción, la amabilidad, la comunicación constructiva y el compromiso con la relación. Además, los indicadores de la autoeficacia de la relación, las habilidades comunicativas en las relaciones y la autoestima con respecto a las habilidades relacionales habían aumentado significativamente, mientras que el nivel de conflictos había disminuido. Se informó un tamaño del efecto mediano para la mayoría de los indicadores. Los participantes de un grupo experimental expresaron un alto nivel de satisfacción con la tecnología y una actitud generalmente positiva hacia la idea de trabajar con un “psicólogo virtual” en un bot de charla sobre sus problemas personales. A pesar de la necesidad de reproducir los resultados de la investigación, el programa iCognito demuestra que tanto la aplicación móvil como las tecnologías de bot de charla pueden ser útiles para formar las habilidades de satisfacción con la relación y de comunicación de las personas, y que pueden ser más eficaces que los libros de autoayuda a la hora de aumentar la satisfacción y reducir el conflicto en las relaciones.Alternate abstract:近年来, 心理健康方面的移动应用程序有了很大的发展。它们中的大多数旨在针对使用认知行为疗法的方法来治疗抑郁症、焦虑症和压力症的治疗过程, 而解决人际关系问题的应用程序开发中的相对较少。本研究测试了ICOGNITO这个有关伴侣关系的程序的有效性, ICOGNITO是一个基于聊天机器人技术的两性关系的自助应用程序。在俄罗斯进行了一项组间实验研究, 以书信疗法作为对照条件 (N = 58, 女性样本), 结果显示, 2周后, ICOGNITO的用户在满意度、温柔度、建设性的沟通以及对关系的承诺方面都有所提高。另外, 关系的自我效能感、人际关系中的沟通技巧以及对关系技巧的自尊都有明显增加, 而冲突程度则有所下降。大多数指标的效应大小被报告为中等。实验组的参与者对该技术表示高度满意, 并对与 "虚拟心理学家" 聊天机器人合作解决他们的个人问题的想法普遍持积极态度。 尽管需要再次试验验证研究结果, 但ICOGNITO项目表明, 手机应用和聊天机器人技术对训练个人的关系满意度和沟通技巧都很有用, 而且在提高关系满意度和减少冲突方面比那些自助书籍会更有效。

T1  - The Mediating Role of Self-Forgiveness in the Relationship between Perceived Social Support and Adjustment to Divorce
AN  - 2658990869
AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the predictive strength of perceived social support on divorce adjustment process, and the mediating role of self-forgiveness in this predictive relationship. In line with this, the hypothetical structural model was tested with a total of 150 individuals who were divorced or in the legal divorce process. The findings showed that perceived social support positively predicted divorce adjustment at high levels, positive and negative attitudes of self-forgiveness did not significantly predict divorce adjustment, and additionally, they did not function as mediating variables in the prediction of divorce adjustment by perceived social support. The fit indices of the tested model revealed good level of fit. The findings were discussed within the framework of the relevant literature and the cultural context.

T1  - Participation and deliberative discourse on social media – Wikipedia talk pages as transnational public spheres?
AN  - 2631375858
AB  - ABSTRACTThis paper focuses on the potential societal function of Wikipedia beyond serving as an encyclopedia. That is, it assesses both theoretically and empirically whether talk pages (TP) – Wikipedia discussion sites that accompany the encyclopedic entries and provide spaces for debates among Wikipedia editors – may function as transnational public spheres. Despite the increasing number of studies on citizen engagement and participation in the age of social media, Wikipedia as an example of the participatory internet has received little research attention in this regard. This study redresses this research gap in two steps. Drawing on Habermas’ concept of the public sphere and Fraser's and Eriksen's modifications thereof, Wikipedia's – specifically the TPs’ – modus operandi is explored to evaluate whether TPs may serve as spaces for transnational political opinion formation. This theoretical exploration is complemented with an empirical assessment of a TP dedicated to the EU. The case study addresses if/to what degree Wikipedia editors have appropriated the TP to function as a transnational public sphere. Findings indicate that Wikipedia TPs can – and do – serve as general transnational public spheres.

T1  - “<i>Historia est magistra vitae</i>”? The impact of historical victimhood on current conspiracy beliefs: GPIR
AN  - 2638250462
AB  - Conspiracy beliefs constitute a propensity to attribute major events to powerful agents acting against less powerful “victims”. In this article we test whether collective victimhood facilitates conspiracy thinking. Study 1 showed that perceived group victimhood is associated with generic and group-specific conspiracy beliefs, but only for individuals who identify highly with their ingroup. Study 2 employed an experimental design to show that experimentally increased group victimhood leads to increased endorsement of conspiracy beliefs among high ingroup identifiers, but decreases endorsement of conspiracy beliefs among low identifiers. This effect was mediated by lack of trust towards outgroup members. Study 3 sought to replicate Study 2 in a different socio-political context. While Study 3 did not directly support the relationship between victimhood, group identification and conspiracy beliefs, an integrated meta-analysis of all three studies provides evidence for a significant interaction of victimhood and group identification in predicting conspiracy beliefs.

T1  - Refugees unwelcome: Narcissistic and secure national commitment differentially predict collective action against immigrants and refugees
AN  - 2667853531
AB  - Two studies (N1 = 193; N2 = 598) were conducted in Poland to examine the role of two types of ingroup commitment (i.e., national narcissism and national identification) as predictors of attitudes towards immigrants and refugees (disadvantaged groups) and intentions to engage in collective action against them. As predicted, national narcissism (but not national identification) was related to more hostile intergroup attitudes and greater willingness to engage in collective action against refugees and immigrants. The positive effect of national narcissism on intentions to engage in collective action against immigrants and refugees was mediated by attitudes towards those groups. These results show that applying a more fine-grained approach to ingroup commitment (e.g., national narcissism vs. national identification) among advantaged group members allows for a better understanding of their intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions to actively oppose the rights of disadvantaged social groups via collective action.

T1  - Varieties of Populist Attitudes and Their Link to Islamophobia in Switzerland
AN  - 2617958026
AB  - The aim of this article is to show whether distinct varieties of populist attitudes emerge within a society, and how they relate to citizens’ Islamophobic attitudes. The study is based on a representative survey conducted in Switzerland in 2019. We used latent class analysis and multinomial regression analyses to identify latent subgroups, yielding five classes of populist attitudes: direct democracy devotees, individuals with populist tendencies, moderate populists, radical anti-elite populists, and radical-universal populists. Compared with the direct democracy devotees class, members of the moderate and the radical-universal populists classes are significantly more likely to hold anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes and to be politically right-wing, while radical anti-elite populists are not associated with either anti-Muslim attitudes or a right-wing ideology.

T1  - Rejection sensitivity and interaction quality in everyday life
AN  - 2609042698
AB  - The elevated satisfaction that comes from interacting with close ties, as opposed to distal ties, is well-established in past research. What remains less clear is how the quality of daily interactions between close versus distal ties may vary as a function of personality. Drawing on data from a 2-week experience sampling study (N = 108 participants, N = 7755 observations), we consider how trait rejection sensitivity (RS)—or the tendency to worry about potential social rejection—interacts with perceived closeness and interaction channel (i.e., face-to-face vs. technology-mediated) in daily life. We find that individuals who are high (vs. low) in rejection sensitivity not only view distal tie interactions as less satisfying, they also perceive close tie exchanges as more enjoyable and supportive—but only for technology-mediated (vs. face-to-face) interactions. We also find that individuals who are high in rejection sensitivity have higher variability in the perceived quality of their interactions. These findings demonstrate the interlocked factors of personality tendencies, perceived closeness, and interaction channel in shaping the variability in the quality of daily interactions.

T1  - Gender Differences in Anti-Gay Prejudice: Evidence for Stability and Change
AN  - 2596813892
AB  - In recent years, there has been remarkable change in societal acceptance of lesbians and gay men. This meta-analysis explored whether this positive shift has reduced the gender difference in these attitudes. We tested Kite and Whitley’s (1996) gender belief system model and replicated their finding that heterosexual men held more negative attitudes toward gay people (g. = 0.37, k = 245, N = 98,295), gay behavior (g. = 0.22, k = 68, N = 98,734), and gay civil rights (g. = 0.16, k = 80, N = 89,187). We also found that heterosexual men were more likely to report engaging in anti-gay behavior (g. = 0.53, k = 7, N = 2,509), endorsing gay stereotypes (g. = 0.17, k = 17, N = 6,936), and wanting to avoid contact with gay men (g. = 0.49, k = 7, N = 2,178). However, heterosexual women reported a stronger desire to avoid contact with lesbians than did heterosexual men (g. = -0.36, k = 5, N = 1,339). For the most part, gender differences remained stable over time; the exceptions were attitudes toward same-gender sexual behavior and attitudes toward lesbian and gay civil rights, which showed small increases. Gender differences in anti-gay prejudice were mediated by gender differences in traditional gender-role beliefs. Moderator variables included participant group, type of measure, and target group.

T1  - Is Touch in Romantic Relationships Universally Beneficial for Psychological Well-Being? The Role of Attachment Avoidance
AN  - 2571580474
AB  - Affectionate touch is crucial for well-being. However, attachment avoidance is associated with negative attitudes toward touch. We tested two preregistered hypotheses about how attachment avoidance influences the association between touch in romantic couples and psychological well-being. We examined whether greater attachment avoidance is associated with a reduced link between touch and well-being, and/or whether reduced touch mediates the relationship between attachment avoidance and lower well-being. Across three studies, including two dyadic ones, we measured retrospective self-reports (Studies 1 and 2), laboratory observations (Study 2), and daily experiences (Study 3) of touch. Touch and well-being were positively associated, and attachment avoidance was associated with lower well-being and less frequent touch. Touch was associated with greater well-being regardless of level of attachment avoidance, and less frequent touch mediated the negative association between attachment avoidance and well-being in most analyses. This underscores the importance of touch, even for those valuing distance and autonomy.

T1  - The SciPop Scale for Measuring Science-Related Populist Attitudes in Surveys: Development, Test, and Validation
AN  - 2572568104
AB  - Populism typically pits political elites against “the virtuous people.” A distinct variant of populism (“science-related populism”) extends beyond politics, targeting academic elites and suggesting they ignore people’s common sense and will. Individual endorsement of such a worldview (“science-related populist attitudes”) has been conceptualized but not yet measured. Hence, we developed the SciPop Scale, a survey instrument to measure science-related populist attitudes. We tested 17 survey items in a first representative survey and developed an 8-item scale. We then tested German, French, and Italian versions of this scale in a second representative survey, employing confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, and external validity tests. Findings show that the SciPop Scale is a robust and reliable measure of populist demands toward science.

T1  - Racism and pride in attitudes toward confederate symbols
AN  - 2537931130
AB  - In this essay, I describe and evaluate the contemporary debate over support for Confederate icons. This debate is often stylized as “heritage” versus “hatred.” In this debate, one side alleges that their favored Confederate symbols represent pride in Southern‐Confederate identity, whereas the other urges that Confederate symbols represent racial hatred and white supremacy. I argue that the “heritage versus hatred” framing that typifies the public debate and the academic literature is not helpful. Additionally, the literature has largely ignored the views of Black Southerners, who have far more negative attitudes toward Confederate symbols compared to whites. Thus, many works implicitly assume a distinctly white southern past. Together, these shortcomings mean that existing research has likely overestimated overall public support for Confederate symbols and overstated the importance of Southern pride or heritage in informing that support, while at the same time underestimating the extent to which racial animus undergirds pro‐Confederate views among whites.

T1  - Ableist contours of Down syndrome in Australia: Facebook attitudes towards existence and parenting of people with Down syndrome
AN  - 2535020176
AB  - The emergence of online disability hate speech on social media platforms is the latest form of ableist expression. This was highlighted when an alarming amount of negative attitudinal responses emerged towards people with Down syndrome and their parents on the 60 Minutes Facebook platform to their segment ‘Does Australia really want to see the end of Down syndrome?’This article analyses the varying contours of ableism within these responses. The responses could be categorised into three broad themes: the construction of Down syndrome as an economic burden on society and a drain on public resources; social attitudes to Down syndrome; and bias related to information provided by the medical profession to pregnant women with a high probability of a Down syndrome birth.These findings allowed us to interrogate what this means in terms of how Australians view difference associated with Down syndrome, and to consider the operationalisation of ableism within the Australian social landscape.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - The other other. Representations and rhetorical estrangement of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian print media, 1970 – 2016
AN  - 2556882683
AB  - This is a qualitative text-analytic study of the discursive representations of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian press 1970–2016. Our study shows how immigration critics textually are estranged and constituted as an other throughout the period. We examine how three main categories of immigration critics are estranged: extremists, populist politicians, and critical citizens. Within these categories, we find manifest estrangement through demonizing and ridiculing. We call this category of rhetorical work for conspicuous estrangement. However, we also find more subtle hints of illegitimacy or alienation in the portrayals. We call this category of rhetorical work of marginalization for inconspicuous estrangement. While other studies have argued that such forms of soft oppression may prepare the ground for forms of hard oppression and increased marginalizing, our study demonstrates that representations instead move toward legitimation, indicating a normalization of populist politics and anti-immigration attitudes in Scandinavia. Our findings thus support research arguing that a mainstreaming of the radical right has occurred.

T1  - What Makes Diets Political? Moral Foundations and the Left-Wing-Vegan Connection
AN  - 2573636474
AB  - Though meat-consumption is known to be a key factor in environmental damage, veganism and vegetarianism are still perceived to be left-wing-phenomena, ironically not penetrating to those who hold ideologies of conservation. Logical contradictions and historical counter-examples cast doubt on a substantive connection between political orientation and meat-eating. Instead, common psychological factors may predispose people toward both: left vs. right-wing political orientation and self-restrictive vs. omnivore eating preferences. Moral foundations have been shown to explain why even seemingly contradictory issue stances are brought forward in the context of the same ideological or political orientation. Here, we expand on these findings by showing the moral foundations to connect political orientation and vegan and vegetarian eating preferences as well as specific strategies of meat-eating justification in a large German sample. Specifically, the binding foundations authority and purity as well as avoidance tendencies are shown to differentially interact with meat-eating across the political spectrum with stronger effects for left-wing adherents and centrists than for the right-wing. Mediation analyses reveal that substantive parts of the association between political orientation and self-restriction in eating are attributable to differences in the moral makeup of left- and right-wing adherents. Connecting our results to prior work on the explanatory power of moral foundations for the political polarization of environmentalism, we discuss how our results may inform inter-ideologically appealing communications of reducing meat consumption, which is a worthwhile and necessary goal for mitigating climate change.

T1  - One Step Forward, Two Tweets Back: Exploring Cultural Backlash and Hockey Masculinity on Twitter
AN  - 2570499711
AB  - Between 2000 and 2018, the number of fights in professional hockey decreased by more than half, reflecting rule changes intended to preserve player health. A 2019 playoff fight ignited debate on social media over the place of fighting in hockey. This research involved a content analysis of an incendiary tweet and the 920 replies it solicited. Content analysis confirmed that cultural backlash exists in sport and provided insight into manifestations of backlash. Comments exhibiting backlash varied by subject (i.e., what or who is being discussed in the tweet) and attitude (i.e., positive approval for fighting and negative attitude toward change), with many defending hockey masculinity. Connections are drawn to manifestations of backlash in the political realm, the extant hockey masculinity literature, and implications for sociological theory and the sport of hockey are discussed.

T1  - The impact of innovation attributes and the mediating effect of environmental attitudes towards environmental management practices among SMEs
AN  - 2517794128
AB  - There is growing concern about the disastrous effect of the food manufacturing sector on the environment, making environmental management practices (EMPs) a potential solution that cannot be ignored. In order to deepen the knowledge related to environmental attitude and the relationship between this attitude and the intention to adopt EMPs, the owner‐managers of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the primary decision‐makers in the organisation, are the best area of interest to be tested. This paper aims to investigate the influence of owner‐managers’ environmental attitude and its mediation effect, as well as the influences of attributes of innovation toward the intention to adopt EMPs. This study was conducted on 367 food manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, and the data collected were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings revealed that environmental attitude, relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity have significantly influenced the owner‐managers’ intention to adopt EMPs. Furthermore, the owner‐managers’ environmental attitude proved to have partial mediation effects in the structural model. The paper has significant implications as it shows the vital role of the owner‐managers’ environmental attitude, not only as a driver that nurtures the intentions of EMPs, but also as an intervening variable that mediates the relationship between the attributes of innovation and the intention to adopt EMPs.

T1  - Economic conditions and perceptions of immigrants as an economic threat in Europe: Temporal dynamics and mediating processes
AN  - 2533167420
AB  - This article addresses the extent to which economic downturns influence the perception of immigrants as an economic threat and through which channels this occurs. Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances. Our database comprises all waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2017. The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions. Further mediation analyses show that objective economic conditions influence anti-immigrant attitudes primarily through individual perceptions of the country’s economic performance and that unemployment rates are of primary importance.

T1  - Early Maternal Employment Status and Attachment Quality: An Investigation of a Conditional Process Model
AN  - 2476109000
AB  - This study examined how maternal employment status during the first year of a child’s life influenced later attachment quality. A sample of 1,364 mothers participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was categorized into five groups including consistent working, transition to working, transition to nonworking, consistent nonworking, and multiple transitions. Results supported the hypothesized model by showing two interrelated mediating mechanisms of depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity. Mothers who have not worked consistently and experienced transition to nonworking showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when compared with mothers who have worked consistently, which in turn negatively influenced maternal sensitivity. Tests of moderated mediation indicated that among nonworking mothers, only those with negative attitudes toward employment showed lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the consistent working group. Findings suggest different mechanisms involved in the relationship between early maternal employment and the development of secure attachment.

T1  - Who Believes in Conspiracy Theories about the COVID-19 Pandemic in Romania? An Analysis of Conspiracy Theories Believers’ Profiles
AN  - 2612842793
AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the circulation of an unprecedented amount of “polluted” information, especially in the social media environment, among which are false narratives and conspiracy theories about both the pandemic and vaccination against COVID-19. The effects of such questionable information primarily concern the lack of compliance with restrictive measures and a negative attitude towards vaccination campaigns, as well as more complex social effects, such as street protests or distrust in governments and authorities in general. Even though there is a lot of scholarly attention given to these narratives in many countries, research about the profile of people who are more prone to believe or spread them is rather scarce. In this context, we investigate the role of age, compared with other socio-demographic factors (such as education and religiosity), as well as the role of the media (the frequency of news consumption, the perceived usefulness of social media, and the perceived incidence of fake information about the virus in the media) and the critical thinking disposition of people who tend to believe such misleading narratives. To address these issues, we conducted a national survey (N = 945) in April 2021 in Romania. Using a hierarchical OLS regression model, we found that people who perceive higher incidence of fake news (ß = 0.33, p < 0.001), find social media platforms more useful (ß = 0.13, p < 0.001), have lower education (ß = −0.17, p < 0.001), and have higher levels of religiosity (ß = 0.08, p < 0.05) are more prone to believe COVID-19-related misleading narratives. At the same time, the frequency of news consumption (regardless of the type of media), critical thinking disposition, and age do not play a significant role in the profile of the believer in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Somewhat surprisingly, age does not play a role in predicting belief in conspiracy theories, even though there are studies that suggest that older people are more prone to believe conspiracy narratives. As far as media is concerned, the frequency of news media consumption does not significantly differ for believers and non-believers. We discuss these results within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Procedural Justice Concerns and Technologically Mediated Interactions with Legal Authorities
AN  - 2585486799
AB  - The use of surveillance technologies by legal authorities has intensified in recent years. As new data collection technologies expand into law enforcement spaces previously dominated by interpersonal interactions, questions emerge about whether the public will evaluate interpersonal and technologically mediated interactions with legal authorities in the same ways. In an analysis guided by procedural justice theory, we examine whether and how legal authorities' use of decision-making technology affects public evaluations of an authority-subordinate interaction and its outcome in the context of airport border crossings. Using an experimental vignette design (N= 278), we varied whether an encounter between a traveller and border security "agent" that produced a secondary search was described as interpersonal (conducted by a human agent) or technologically mediated (conducted by a machine agent). We also varied the traveller's group membership relative to the nation-state, describing the traveller as either bom in the country in question and a member of the nation's most common racial group (in-group) or not bom in the country and a racial minority (outgroup). Both encounter type and group membership independently affected perceptions of the interaction (procedural justice judgements) and its outcome (distributive justice judgments). Technologically mediated encounters improved perceptions of procedural and distributive justice. Further, procedural justice judgments mediated the relationship between encounter type and distributive justice, demonstrating how perceptions of interactions influence perceptions of the outcomes of those interactions. Outgroup members were evaluated as having worse experiences across all measures. The findings underscore the importance of extending tests of procedural justice theory beyond interpersonal interactions to techno logically mediated interactions.

T1  - The Socio-economic Effects Of Covid-19 Lockdown in Nigeria: Implications on Micro and Macro Economy
AN  - 2583607000
AB  - Many countries across the planet are facing unprecedented challenges as a result of COVID-19 infections. Nigeria, Africa's most populous country is no exception. The government has implemented a range of measures to curb the spread of the pandemic, including closure of international airports, shutting down of institutions, markets/stores etc. On March 29th, an initial four-week state-wide lockdown was declared in three major states, Lagos, Abuja and Ogun, halting all essential activities. Following this Executive Order, state governments throughout the country took stringent measures such as restrictions on inter-state travel, instituting curfews, etc. Against this backdrop, the paper reviewed the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria and its implications on the micro and macro economy. The study adopted the systems theory. Due to safety protocols established by health experts on the COVID-19 pandemic, data for the study were drawn from participant observation, media commentaries and authentic secondary sources. The content analytical technique was used to review the literature on the subject matter. The study reported that the halt in business activities in the country has rendered many penniless and unable to provide for themselves the basic amenities needed for the duration ofthe lockdown. The study concluded that Federal Government of Nigeria should waive payments on personal and corporate income tax for the second quarter and third quarter of 2020, considering that the shock has affected the income andprofits ofhouseholds and businesses.

T1  - News repertoires and information behavior in Austria—What is the role of social inequality?
AN  - 2486862603
AB  - The changes in the global mediascape have had a tremendous impact on societal news flows. Using data from the Social Survey Austria 2018 and a quantitative application of the media repertoire approach, the article illustrates how information behavior and news seeking relate to social status, political orientation and sociodemographics. The results confirm that the developments in Austria—often referred to as a representative of a traditional media landscape—are mostly in line with international trends, as new media have been added to the media repertoires of approximately two-thirds of the sample. Effects tied to social inequality generally match previous assumptions: Higher educational achievements and income lead to more diversified news repertoires. Additionally, the overall structure of the data indicates that the online-only users are still a small minority, consisting of younger individuals who are less likely to work and more likely to vote for left-wing parties.

T1  - Subjective Age in Older Korean Americans: The Impact of Functional Disability Mediated by Attitudes Toward Aging
AN  - 2447808047
AB  - The present study aims to examine how subjective age of older Korean Americans would be affected by functional disability and attitudes toward aging. We hypothesized that (a) both functional disability and attitudes toward aging would have a direct effect on subjective age and (b) the effect of functional disability on subjective age would be mediated by attitudes toward aging. Our analyses of the survey data with 208 community-dwelling Korean Americans aged 60 and older (mean age = 69.6, SD = 7.51) showed that the indirect effect of functional disability on subjective age through attitudes toward aging [–.020 (.009)] was significant (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [–.039, –.006]). The findings suggest that functional disability fosters negative attitudes toward aging, which in turn leads to the feelings of being older than actual age. Our study suggests ways to preserve and promote positive perceptions of age and aging.

T1  - Gender Essentialism, Authoritarianism, Social Dominance Orientation, and Filial Piety as Predictors for Transprejudice in Chinese People
AN  - 2442687960
AB  - Although research on prejudice against gender and sexual minorities has been increasing in recent years, little attention has been paid to predictors for transprejudice and its potential culture-specific correlates in particular. This cross-sectional study addressed these gaps in the literature by exploring the relative contributions of social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, filial piety, and essentialist beliefs of gender to negative attitudes toward transgender people in 371 Chinese participants. Path analyses showed that (a) consistent with previous research, authoritarianism and social dominance orientation made independent contributions to explaining variance in transprejudice; (b) filial piety, as a culture-specific variable, was a unique predictor for transprejudice beyond the effects of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; and (c) these relations appeared to be mediated by gender essentialism. Our findings suggest that people with higher levels of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation tend to have stronger essentialist beliefs of gender, which may in turn contribute to the development of transprejudice. It also highlights the importance of identifying culture-specific predictors (e.g., filial piety in a Chinese context) when we attempt to understand transprejudice.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Fake News Is Real: The Significance and Sources of Disbelief in Mainstream Media in Trump’s America
AN  - 2441436794
AB  - Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in the guise of “fake news” merely a diversion from more fundamental threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.

T1  - Towards an Integration of Models of Discrimination of Immigrants: from Ultimate (Functional) to Proximate (Sociofunctional) Explanations
AN  - 2229809169
AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

T1  - Reflecting on Sacrifices Made by Past Generations Increases a Sense of Obligation Towards Future Generations
AN  - 2409934021
AB  - Tackling climate change presents an intergenerational dilemma: People must make sacrifices today, to benefit future generations. What causes people to feel an obligation to benefit future generations? Past research has suggested “intergenerational reciprocity” as a potential driver, but this research is quite domain specific, and it is unknown how well it applies to climate change. We explored a novel means of invoking a sense of intergenerational reciprocity: inducing reflection on the sacrifices made by previous generations. Our studies revealed that such reflection predicts and causes a heightened sense of moral obligation towards future generations, mediated by gratitude. However, there are also some downsides (e.g., feelings of unworthiness), and perceptions of obligation do not substantially affect pro-environmental attitudes or motivations. Thus, while reflecting on past generations’ sacrifices can generate a sense of intergenerational obligation, it is limited in the extent to which it can increase pro-environmental concern.

T1  - Can the curriculum be a tool to engage pre-service teachers in prevention of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity? A teacher–educator dialogue
AN  - 2460970657
AB  - This article offers a reflexive conversation between three teacher-educators from a South African university, who teach in the Curriculum Studies discipline. We consider how we can use the curriculum to engage pre-service teachers in discussions that might lead to active participation around issues of prevention and changing of attitudes towards gender-based violence (GBV) against people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ+) people. We used a discussion prompt in the form of a newspaper article. Drawing on transcripts of our audio-recorded dialogue we present a brief examination of our interchanges. Through this dialogue, we attempt to develop a shared sense of how we can use the curriculum to begin engaging students in conversations and confrontation of their own prejudices, so they can, in turn, translate that into their own practice as future teachers.

T1  - A Journey Researching Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2404395244
AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author's 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous, African Canadians, Francophone minorities in EnglishCanada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Leçon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide.

T1  - Where the Other Side Gets News: Audience Perceptions of Selective Exposure in the 2016 Election
AN  - 2431020364
AB  - Building on research on selective exposure, hostile media perceptions, and presumed media influence, this study explores what citizens believe about their political rivals’ news habits and introduces the idea of perceived selective exposure: the extent to which citizens believe their political opponents curate media diets of like-minded political news. Results from a national survey of voters (N = 657) show that during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, voters disagreed about the extent to which prominent news sources favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The more undesirably biased voters considered a source, the more news they assumed their political rivals received from that source. This perceived selectivity was consequential: A belief that others’ news habits were weighted toward like-minded media was linked to a belief that others’ election news choices had reinforced their attitudes. Partisans think their political rivals are selecting biased news sources that bolster extremity.

T1  - Autonomy, productiveness, and community: the rise of inequality in an Amazonian society
AN  - 2354587422
AB  - In Amazonian societies, autonomy is said to be a core value motivating egalitarian politics. This article shows how the quest for autonomy and productiveness presently sets in motion processes that encroach upon these very values. Among the Shuar of Amazonian Ecuador, the realization of autonomy and productiveness increasingly depends on the capture of state resources. Shuar interact with the local state as members of relatively recent sedentary communities and through the mediation of elected leaders. In these processes, ‘community’ itself is transformed: being a channel to regenerate domestic livelihoods, it also becomes an end in itself, giving rise to new economistic attitudes while legitimizing inequalities between commoners and leaders. The article suggests that the pursuit of autonomy and productiveness within a process of village formation is central to the transformation of egalitarianism that occurs when small‐scale Amazonian polities engage with nation‐state politics.Alternate abstract:AbstraitAutonomie, productivité et communauté : l'essor de l'inégalité dans une société amazonienneRésuméL'autonomie est présentée comme une valeur centrale motivant des politiques égalitaires dans les sociétés amazoniennes. Le présent article montre comment la quête d'autonomie et de productivité met aujourd'hui en branle des processus qui compromettent ces valeurs mêmes. Chez les Shuars d'Amazonie équatorienne, la réalisation de l'autonomie et de la productivité dépend de plus en plus de la captation de ressources étatiques. Les Shuars interagissent avec l’État local en tant que membres de communautés assez récemment sédentarisées et par l'intermédiaire de chefs élus. Par ces processus, la « communauté » elle‐même se transforme : de canal de régénération des moyens de subsistance domestiques, elle devient aussi une fin en soi, suscitant de nouvelles attitudes économistes tout en justifiant les inégalités entre la population et les chefs. L'article suggère que la poursuite de l'autonomie et de la productivité dans le cadre d'un processus de formation de villages est au cœur de la transformation de l'égalitarisme qui se produit lorsque les petites collectivités amazoniennes s'engagent dans la politique de l'État‐nation.

T1  - What factors explain anti-Muslim prejudice? An assessment of the effects of Muslim population size, institutional characteristics and immigration-related media claims
AN  - 2376776840
AB  - What factors explain majority members’ anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members’ negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration – our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.

T1  - The dual causes of fragmentation: Democratic security and the communitarian state in Colombian politics
AN  - 2327863069
AB  - This chapter analyzes speeches delivered by former Colombian President, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, between August 2002 and August 2009, which can be found on the official website of the presidency: (http://web.presidencia.gov.co/discursos/). We attempt to identify the webs of meaning surrounding the concepts of ‘Democratic Security’ and ‘Communitarian State’ with awareness of the relationship between discourse, ideology and power. The aim is to better understand the political power of the plans, programs and projects developed by Uribe’s administration, and how this was affected by widespread deployment of the media. These policies are conditioned by a set of colonialist principles that are embodied in symbolic-discursive strategies that result in representations, by means of which mechanisms of marginalization, discrimination and polarized hierarchy are legitimized from the different social spheres. During the 7-year period analyzed there were controversial debates over the commission of crimes against humanity by national security agents, as well as corruption scandals over topics like ‘para-politics’, ‘false positives’, selective arrests, extrajudicial killings and violations of the sovereignty of bordering countries. Within this political context, we attempt to identify the inherent tensions and social conflicts. It is argued that the analyzed discourses reproduce colonialist thoughts, in relation to neoliberal principles and the application of global policies. Using the principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we explore the strategies and resources used in Uribe’s speeches and how major themes are positioned to reproduce systems of beliefs, values and attitudes.

T1  - Justice reactions to deviant ingroup members: Ingroup identity threat motivates utilitarian punishments
AN  - 2301338563
AB  - To maintain a positive overall view of their group, people judge likeable ingroup members more favourably and deviant ingroup members more harshly than comparable outgroup members. Research suggests that such derogation of deviant ingroup members aims to restore the image of the group by symbolically excluding so‐called ‘black sheeps’. We hypothesized that information about a harm‐doer's group membership influences observers’ justice‐seeking reactions. Motives for punishment vary based on whether the goal is to punish past harm‐doing (i.e., retributive motives), help harm‐doers recognize the harm inflicted and reintegrate into society (i.e., restorative motives), or control harm‐doer's future behaviour through incapacitating practices and exclusion from society (i.e., utilitarian motives). We hypothesized that immoral behaviours by ingroup rather than outgroup members jeopardize the group's reputation and therefore activate utilitarian (i.e., exclusion‐oriented) motives for punishment. Study 1 (N = 187) confirmed that people displayed more utilitarian motives and less restorative motives when sanctioning an ingroup as opposed to an outgroup harm‐doer. Study 2 (N = 122) manipulated typicality to the ingroup. Participants displayed stronger utilitarian (i.e., exclusion‐oriented) punishment motives when the harm‐doer was presented as a typical ingroup rather than an outgroup member. Study 3 (N = 292) replicated the findings of Studies 1 and 2 and further showed that people displayed stronger utilitarian punishments against an ingroup offender through the experience of increased identity threat. Contrary to our expectations, observers’ ingroup identification did not moderate the effect of group membership or typicality to the ingroup on justice reactions. Yet, ingroup identification influenced both experienced identity threat (i.e., mediator) and utilitarian motives for punishment with high identifiers experiencing higher threat and displaying stronger utilitarian punishment motive. We discuss the results in terms of people's concern for the protection of their group identity.

T1  - Divided loyalties: Perceptions of disloyalty underpin bias toward dually-identified minority-group members
AN  - 2300158983
AB  - Majority-group members often hold negative attitudes toward minority-group members who identify with both the majority and their minority group. Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework, we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study 1, majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4, which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications.

T1  - The media factor influencing the effect of organ donation advocacy in South Korea
AN  - 2336248827
AB  - In this study, we investigated the influence of the media factor on the effect of and resistance to media advocacy for organ donation by conducting a web-based experiment with a 2 (media: conservative vs. progressive) by 2 (political orientation: conservative vs. progressive) factorial design with media and political orientation as between-subjects factors. The results demonstrate that organ donation intention after exposure to a message advocating organ donation was greater for conservatives in the conservative media group than for those in the progressive media group. The effect of participant–media agreement in regard to political orientation on organ donation intention was explained by perceived media credibility and psychological reactance.

T1  - When we want them to fear us: The motivation to influence outgroup emotions in collective action: GPIR
AN  - 2251007534
AB  - Prior work has shown that the experience of group-based emotions can motivate disadvantaged group members to engage in collective action. In the current research, we tested whether such action can also be driven by the motivation to induce certain emotions among the outgroup to the extent that disadvantaged group members believe this would help them attain their social change goals. We tested this hypothesis in three studies (two correlational and one experimental) within the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Study 1 showed that individuals’ motivation to induce outgroup regret was associated with nonviolent collective action tendencies, whereas the motivation to induce outgroup fear was related to violent action. Study 2 moved beyond Study 1 by assessing corrective and punitive goals of social change. We found that preferences for inducing outgroup regret mediated the relationship between endorsement of corrective goals and nonviolent action tendencies, whereas preferences for outgroup fear mediated the relationship between punitive goals and violent action. Study 3 provided experimental support for the causal effect of goals on emotion motivations and collective action tendencies. Together, our findings are in line with the notion of instrumental emotion regulation as applied to collective action.

T1  - Tainted Love: How Stigmatization of a Political Party in News Media Reduces Its Electoral Support
AN  - 2430088371
AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters’ reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters’ perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.

T1  - When political values and perceptions of deservingness collide: Evaluating public support for homelessness investments in Canada
AN  - 2236074077
AB  - Citizen attitudes toward welfare state investments are often explained by their ideological values and their perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients, yet recent experimental research has led to the theorization that clear deservingness cues can overwhelm otherwise strong ideological beliefs. We tested these claims with respect to homelessness in Canada using a vignette survey experiment and found evidence that citizens with very different political beliefs can support similar government investments, indeed from a shared sense of deservingness as suggested by recent experimental studies, but that support is anchored by rather different reasons.Key Practitioner Message:• Citizen support for homelessness investments is jointly mediated by ideology and a sense of the “deservingness” of the beneficiary.• Emphasizing the broader cost savings to taxpayers from “Housing First” does not make conservative‐leaning citizens more supportive of investments.• Emphasizing the personal attributes of persons experiencing homelessness rather than abstract statistics may unite progressives and conservatives on “deservingness”.

T1  - How feeling connected to one’s own community can increase support for addressing injustice impacting outgroup communities: GPIR
AN  - 2229907560
AB  - How can agents of social change increase public support for minority communities? In three studies, we demonstrate how heightened feelings of community connection can predict support for addressing injustice in minority communities. Community connection, when experimentally evoked (Study 1) or measured (Study 3), was associated with heightened support for the government addressing substandard conditions in an African American housing project (Studies 1 and 3) and Native American reservations (Study 1). Mediation analyses revealed that this effect emerges, at least in part, because of a heightened perceived value of all communities—not merely one’s own (Studies 1 and 3). One reason that stronger feelings of community connection lead to (Study 2) or are associated with (Study 3) greater valuing of communities is a strengthened superordinate community identity. We tested additional potential mediators of the community connection–support relationship; out-group identification mediated but outgroup attachment did not. Implications for social change are discussed.

T1  - QUESTIONING the SUPER-RICH: Representations, Structures, Experiences
AN  - 2230285961
AB  - The authors outline how multiple dimensions-historical and contemporary; global and local; political, economic, social, and cultural-inform an understanding of the super-rich. Recent super-rich scholarship is reviewed with regard to three themes: discourses and representations; mechanisms and structures; experiences and identities. The empirical and conceptual insights of the contents are then highlighted, with regard to the significance of discourses of legitimacy, namely, those of meritocracy, civility, and luxury; the intersections of race and class that underpin assumptions about and representations of wealth; institutional and political-economic dynamics, in relation to international financial systems and property markets; and experiences and attitudes, examined via elites' professional identities and cultural practices. The authors suggest that questioning the super-rich provides an avenue for the study of power in society, how it is reproduced, and how global hierarchies may be shifting. To that end, the articles attempt to make visible the brute force of the infrastructures (politics and policy, cultural and occupational conventions, financial devices and systems) that are occluded by the tendency to focus on the gloss of super-rich lifestyles; to draw attention to the long-term and newly emerging tensions within and between categories of wealth and of elites, and spheres of political, economic, and cultural activity; and to contribute to an understanding of how the accumulation of wealth is perpetuated and excused through discourses of legitimation, structural dynamics, and lived identities. These are much-needed critical interventions at a time of escalating inequality.

T1  - Impersonal subjectivation from platforms to infrastructures
AN  - 2170231986
AB  - The rapid expansion of social media has led to the concentration of digitized, networked, and mediated processes into the hands of a few giant corporations (e.g. Google, Facebook, and Amazon), their partners and affiliates. From smart watches to targeted advertising and reputation scores, this new political economy of subjectivation – or subject making – sees an intensification of datafication to sell commodities, manipulate moods, inject ideologies, and influence behaviors. This article argues that in order to understand this new political economy of subjectivation, we need to complicate and build upon framework that focus on the collection of personal data and its risks on individual users. We argue that as social media and digital media giant corporations move away from an enclosed platform model toward a distributed, impersonal infrastructure, the mining of individual data and the shaping of individual attitudes is increasingly geared toward establishing relationships between user data and a plethora of non-human, environmental data. Such an infrastructure invokes impersonal subjects, and thus requires a new politics of relationality.

T1  - Tanni Grey-Thompson - 'The one that got away': a theological analysis of foeticide, infanticide and the deviant Paralympic success story
AN  - 2178535253
AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession's negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games.

T1  - Sexual minority women's attitudes toward infants, children, and parenthood
AN  - 2303793125
AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women's sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood.

T1  - Social exclusion of life in the written media of the disabilities: the importance of media literacy and education
AN  - 2157776921
AB  - Disability is not only a health problem faced by disabled people and their families; it is necessary to consider it as a situation closely related to social aspects and society. Disability is a social phenomenon that concerns the disabled, the family, the immediate surroundings, and the community to which they belong. Disabled individuals, like every human being, want to share their social surroundings and their experiences of briefly living their emotions, thoughts, dreams. However, even for non-disabled individuals, communication, which can be difficult under certain conditions, can become even more difficult for disabled people. Because the psycho-social structure, values, attitudes, perceptions of life, and thoughts of the individuals in society are different. Therefore, disabled individual who is evaluated as a pitiful and poor person by the influence of prejudices in the social perception process can be exposed to the negative attitudes of the society and be excluded. It is not an “obstacle” on the basis of the “disability” your disability faces; the society that prefers the difference created by the obstacle lies in the “obstructive attitudes” developed against the obstruction. Written media have been shown and proven as the reason for this difference in our work. Our work will be demonstrated by an in-depth interview methodology of approaching the subject of five disabled people with the highest number of disabled people in the TRNC. Negative perceptions of the disability within the society are not only something that the written media can correct, but are also closely connected with the consciousness of the associations’ authorities and their shaping of their strategies accordingly. We tried to emphasize the media importance of literacy and media literacy education in this area. The media literacy training program will reduce the negative representations created by the media and their negative consequences because there will be conscious media consumers. At this point, the social exclusion that the people living in the society in the presence of the media representatives of the disability will be reduced the most.

T1  - Dissecting the politics of “Obamacare”: The role of distributive justice, deservingness, and affect
AN  - 2132138381
AB  - Political conservatives (vs. liberals) are commonly thought to oppose government‐based policies that promote equal distribution of resources, preferring that resources be distributed based on merit. In a sample of American adults (n = 436), distributive fairness perceptions, deservingness, and affective reactions related to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) were examined to better understand the ideological differences in ACA attitudes. Participants completed measures of political orientation, ACA knowledge and attitudes, deservingness, distributive justice principles (i.e., need, equality, merit), anger, and sympathy. Identifying as politically liberal (vs. conservative) and greater knowledge on the ACA predicted greater ACA support. Preferences for the distributive justice principles of equality and need (but not equity) mediated the relation between political orientation and ACA attitudes. Further, conservatives perceived less deservingness and in turn experienced greater anger and opposition to the ACA. Additional exploratory analyses also suggest that the positive path between deservingness and ACA support is moderated by political orientation such that it is stronger among political liberals than conservatives. Implications of the ideological chasm in relation to the ACA are considered.

T1  - Perceived threat mediates the relationship between national identification and support for immigrant exclusion: A Cross-National Test of Intergroup Threat Theory
AN  - 2132685967
AB  - Hypotheses derived from intergroup threat theory and social identity theory were tested by analyzing cross-national data about national identity and attitude toward immigrants. National identification, perceived threat and support for irregular immigrant exclusion were considered as variables at the individual level. Gross domestic product, Gini index and individualism–collectivism index were used as national descriptors. Results indicated that, across 33 nations worldwide, intergroup threat mediated the relationship between national identification and support for immigrant exclusion. Moreover, the level of national wealth moderated this mediation so that perceived threat was a stronger mediator in rich than in poor nations. On the other hand, Gini index and individualism did not affect this mediation. Present findings are supportive for intergroup threat theory and social identity theory.

T1  - Influences of Media Exposure on Chinese University Students' Attitudes and Perceptions of Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 2043766864
AB  - Research on media influence on attitudes and perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent predictor of IPV, is limited. Using a convenience sample of 2057 Chinese undergraduate students, this survey explored influences of media exposure on attitudes and perceptions of IPV the first time in literature. Significant differences (p < .05) of perceptions of IPV were found between respondents who reported developing cognitions of IPV from books, magazines, or newspapers and those who didn't, with the former having better perceptions than the latter. Positive associations were also found between print-based media access and perceptions and negative attitudes concerning IPV.

T1  - Investigating the Effects of Media Consumption on Attitudes Toward Police Legitimacy
AN  - 2035225750
AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics.

T1  - Implicit Theories of Criminal Behavior: Fostering Public Support for Ex-offender Community Reentry
AN  - 2096644532
AB  - Ex-offenders face many barriers during the process of community reentry, including difficulty obtaining housing or employment. These barriers are often the result of stigma and discrimination that can negatively affect domains of functioning and well-being that are central to successful reintegration. Implicit theory suggests that stigmatizing attitudes may be explained through beliefs regarding the invariable (fixed mindset) or malleable (growth mindset) nature of human attributes. Prior work demonstrated how these mindsets can explain attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for community reentry. In this manuscript, we report on two studies that examined whether attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for their reentry can be influenced through a brief mindset-based persuasive reading. In Study 1, we piloted a brief, experimental manipulation among a student sample (n = 352) to induce growth mindsets regarding criminal behavior to foster positive attitudes toward ex-offenders and their reentry. In Study 2, we replicated the first study in a community-based sample (n = 451) and tested ex-offender race as a potential moderator. Mediation analyses demonstrated a causal pathway between mindset condition, attitudes toward ex-offenders, and support for reentry, and provided empirical evidence that the mindset-based experimental manipulation can foster growth mindsets and support for ex-offender community reentry, regardless of ex-offender race. Findings present directions for developing a potentially low-cost and time-effective strategy that can be disseminated easily through online or other media platforms, and tailored to target specific barriers to reentry. Further research is needed to establish the persistence of effects on attitudinal changes over time.

T1  - The Psychology of the Politics of Rape: Political Ideology, Moral Foundations, and Attitudes Toward Rape
AN  - 2012371802
AB  - Previous research has found that conservatives and liberals emphasize different moral foundations. The purpose of these two studies was to investigate whether moral foundations mediate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward rape among U.S. college students. In Study 1, moral foundations fully mediated the relationship between political ideology and rape myth acceptance. Study 2 generally replicated the results of Study 1, with binding foundations demonstrating the most consistent mediating effects. These results suggest that individual differences in moral decision-making may explain the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward rape.

T1  - Post-Communism in Institutional, Ideological and Communicative Dimensions: Critical Notes. Part II: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2096656682
AB  - The second part of the article is devoted to the question of the role played by political communication and the mass media in the development of social processes in the Central and Eastern Europe. The study of paradoxical properties of the phenomenon of post-communism has become one of the most important incentives for the turn of the humanities in the direction of analyzing the specifics of the new communicative and rhetorical properties of political texts in the structure of ideological discourses both in Europe and outside it. The specific nature of post-communist social communication when ideological labels are often meaningless and exchangeable, and citizens remain unengaged in the political process, increased the role of manipulative factors realized through the media. This tendency initially manifested itself in various “mediocratic” projects and utopias based on the desire of politicized intellectuals to form a “new political language” and thereby strengthen their positions in political discourse, ultimately winning the legitimate right to power. The rapid evolution of the post-communist political discourse from “liberal humanism” and “universal values” to reactionary myth-making, nationalist rhetoric and xenophobia, clearly demonstrates that one of the main sources of constant ideological transformations in the public consciousness is the extremely contradictory political ideas and attitudes of intellectuals rushing into power already at the initial stage of reforms. At the same time, crisis situations, the growth of traditionalist nationalism indicate that pathological tendencies and changes in the structures of post-communist regimes have a systemic and global character.

T1  - Outgroup members’ internal criticism promotes intergroup openness: The role of perceived risk
AN  - 2008940929
AB  - Research suggests that hearing an outgroup member voice internal criticism increases individuals’ openness to the outgroup's perspective. We replicate and extend these findings in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Israeli participants exposed to a Palestinian official voicing internal criticism reported more openness to the Palestinian narrative of the conflict, an effect that was mediated by an increase in participants’ perception that Palestinians are open‐minded and a subsequent increase in their hope for more positive relations between the two groups. In our extension of these findings, we examined a complementary mechanism contributing to the effectiveness of the criticism manipulation, specifically the extent to which participants perceive that the Palestinian official took a risk voicing criticism of Palestinians. Positive messages from a hostile outgroup may be received with suspicion, but if they are articulated under great risk to the speaker, greater credibility may be granted. Across two studies, we demonstrate that the criticism conveys risk to the speaker and that this risk is predictive of the perceived credibility of the speaker, and participants’ subsequent openness to the outgroup's perspective.

T1  - Immigrant perpetrators in the news: A terror management approach to resultant hostility, perceived vulnerability, and immigration issue judgment
AN  - 2013187444
AB  - This study found that mortality salience in TV news activated more hostile attitude toward the perpetrators and negative judgment on the immigration issue. Social group difference influenced news viewers' immigration issue judgment, but did not affect their resultant hostility and perceived vulnerability. More negative attitudes emerged toward the immigration issue when immigrant perpetrators were portrayed negatively in the news. News viewers with exposure to mortality salience in TV news reported more negative toward immigrants. Exposure to mortality-related elements in TV news could lead to social conflicts that were viewed as a severe threat by U.S. government and policymakers.

T1  - Beyond Acceptance: Serving the Needs of Transgender Students at Women’s Colleges
AN  - 2116061047
AB  - The inclusion of transgender students in women’s colleges has been widely debated on campuses and in the media. Despite some opposition, transgender students at women’s colleges are growing in number and visibility. This study examines the ways that transgender students’ experiences differ from the experiences of cisgender students in both single-sex and co-educational environments. Conclusions are based on assessments of support, reported attitudes towards transgender students, and reported knowledge about transgender history and social issues using responses to a survey completed by 184 students at a variety of colleges and universities. The study found significant differences between women’s colleges and co-educational universities such that women’s colleges were rated as more supportive for all students and students at women’s colleges reported significantly more positive attitudes towards transgender students. Additionally, transgender students at women’s colleges reported more positive overall experiences of college, as compared to transgender students at co-educational colleges. Given that the sample was majority white, cisgender, women’s college students, the measures used should be replicated in order to determine the generalizability of these results.

T1  - A multimodal discourse analytic approach to the articulation of Martini's "desire" positioning in filmic product placement
AN  - 2012907069
AB  - Product placement constitutes an amply used tactic in a marketer's Integrated Marketing Communications roster. Its merits in circumventing negative attitudes to advertising and in integrating brand values in sociocultural narratives in TV and cinematic filmic discourses have been repeatedly stressed. However, little attention has been placed thus far in the idiosyncratic mode that is scrutinized in this paper, that is product placement by leveraging uncertainty, surprise, postponement and displacement as defining characteristics of the discourse of desire. The analysis of the discourse of desire that unravels in a flirting sequence from the blockbuster movie "Hitch" demonstrates that although the concerned brand (Martini) is minimally visible in the analyzed scene, yet it attains to appropriate as part of its core DNA in "stealth" mode the above characteristics of desire by demarcating the cultural field of flirtation. The offered cultural analytic addresses this idiosyncratic product placement mode by drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis and multimodal discourse analysis.

T1  - Utopian Hopes or Dystopian Fears? Exploring the Motivational Underpinnings of Moralized Political Engagement
AN  - 1864984220
AB  - People are more likely to become politically engaged (e.g., vote, engage in activism) when issues are associated with strong moral convictions. The goal of this research was to understand the underlying motivations that lead to this well-replicated effect. Specifically, to what extent is moralized political engagement motivated by proscriptive concerns (e.g., perceived harms, anticipated regret), prescriptive concerns (e.g., perceived benefits, anticipated pride), or some combination of these processes? And are the motivational pathways between moral conviction and political engagement the same or different for liberals and conservatives? Two studies (combined N = 2,069) found that regardless of political orientation, the association between moral conviction and political engagement was mediated by the perceived benefits of preferred but not the perceived harms of non-preferred policy outcomes, and by both anticipated pride and regret, findings that replicated in two contexts: legalizing same-sex marriage and allowing concealed weapons on college campuses.

T1  - The associations between body dissatisfaction, body figure, self-esteem, and depressed mood in adolescents in the United States and Korea: A moderated mediation analysis
AN  - 2046620388
AB  - The perception of one's body image becomes particularly important in adolescence. Body dissatisfaction has been associated with negative psychological functioning, such as self-esteem and depression. Previous findings showed that the decreased self-esteem due to body dissatisfaction explained the association between negative attitude toward body and psychological well-being in different cultural contexts. The present study examined adolescents from the US (N = 1002) and Korea (N = 3993) and replicated and extended the previous findings regarding body dissatisfaction and associated psychological outcomes. The results showed that body dissatisfaction predicted higher depressed mood and that self-esteem mediated this association for both American and Korean adolescents. Notably, the indirect effect of body dissatisfaction and perceived body image on depressed mood via self-esteem was greater for American adolescents than for Korean adolescents. The implications of the cultural difference in the significance of self-esteem in mediating the body dissatisfaction and depressed mood are discussed.

T1  - Ideological Heterogeneity and the Rise of Donald Trump
AN  - 1871674423
AB  - In the days after the 2016 election, a variety of explanations has been offered to explain Donald Trump’s unique ascendancy in American politics. Scholars have discussed Trump’s appeal to rural voters, his hybrid media campaign strategy, shifts in voter turnout, Hillary Clinton’s campaign advertising strategy, economic anxiety, differences in sexist and racist attitudes among Trump voters and so forth. Here, we add another key factor to the conversation: Trump’s appeal to a smaller, often ignored, segment of the electorate: populist voters. Building upon our previous work - demonstrating that while American political elites compete across a single dimension of conflict, the American people organize their attitudes around two distinct dimensions, one economic and one social - we use 2008 American National Elections Study (ANES) data and 2016 ANES primary election data to show that populist support for Trump, and nationalist policies themselves, help us to understand how Trump captured the Republican nomination and the White House.

T1  - It's the frame that matters: Immigrant integration and media framing effects in the Netherlands
AN  - 1842821340
AB  - In the past years the Netherlands have witnessed turbulent debates on immigration and integration, characterized by high levels of negativity and containing a variety of different viewpoints, i.e., frames, of the issue. We use a 4 x 2 between subjects experiment to investigate, which responses four salient immigration frames elicit among Dutch citizens. The results show that, whereas the willingness to support collective action is affected by the valence of the story, attitudes towards immigrants and intercultural behavioural intentions are affected by the frame of the story: the multicultural frame exerts positive, and the victimization frame exerts negative effects, regardless of the valence of the story.

T1  - Does change in minority and women's representation on television matter?: a 30-year study of television portrayals and social tolerance
AN  - 2571055024
AB  - Increases in substantive portrayals of working women, racial groups, and sexual minorities on television are a common explanation for some of the observed increase in social tolerance over the last few decades. In this study, I first document change in these portrayals from 1970 to 2000. After doing so, I determine if higher levels of recurring portrayals are associated with greater levels of social tolerance for those who report watching larger amounts of television. If no association is found, this would validate claims of non-existent or minimal effects. The findings show that frequent television viewers generally have more negative attitudes as compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals of these groups are low. However, television viewers have similar or higher levels of social tolerance compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals become frequent. This supports the argument that increasing televised portrayals of women and minorities on television can help increase social tolerance, but differences in the substance and quality of these portrayals likely condition this link.

T1  - News as a Cultural Mirror: Historically Black Newspapers Reflecting Public Views of Loving v. Virginia (1967)
AN  - 1748050440
AB  - This study examined seven historically Black newspapers' coverage of the landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia (1967), which overturned anti-miscegenation laws that prevented non-White individuals from marrying White individuals. A content analysis of frames and source usage within 31 news stories about the case indicated that about half of the stories (N = 14) advocated for the Lovings and a small number (N = 1) advocated for the State of Virginia; the remaining stories were either informational (N = 7) or objectivist (N = 9). Because the media is said to be a cultural mirror of public opinion, the results of this study may indicate the public's views on the issue of intermarriage laws. This study's findings also showed that historically Black newspapers agreed with their mainstream counterparts more than they disagreed.

T1  - TO TEST OR NOT? SINGULAR OR MULTIPLE HERITAGE?
AN  - 1733239665
AB  - DNA ancestry testing may seem frivolous, but it points to two crucial questions: First, what is the relationship, if any, between biology and race? Second, how much and why do people prefer clear, singular racial identities over blurred, mixed racial self-understandings, or the reverse? We posit that individuals of different racial or ethnic backgrounds will have different levels of support for this new technology. In particular, despite the history of harm caused by the biologization of race, we theorize that African Americans will be receptive to the use of DNA ancestry testing because conventional genealogical searches for ancestral roots are mostly unavailable to them. This "broken chain" theory leads to two hypotheses, of disproportionately high Black interest in DNA ancestry testing--thus an implicit acceptance of a link between biology and race--and high acceptance among Blacks of multiple heritages despite a preference for evidence of roots in Africa. To test these hypotheses, we analyze two databases of U.S. newspaper articles, one with almost 6,000 items and a second with 700. We also analyze two new public opinion surveys of nationally representative samples of adult Americans. Most of the evidence comes from the second survey, which uses vignettes to obtain views about varied results of DNA ancestry testing. We find that the media increasingly report on the links between genetic inheritance and race, and emphasize singular racial ancestry more than multiple heritages. The surveys show, consistent with our theory, that Blacks (and Hispanics, to some degree) are especially receptive to DNA ancestry testing, and are pleased with not only a finding of group singularity but also a finding of multiple points of origin. Qualitative readings of media reports illuminate some of the reasons behind these survey findings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the broader importance of DNA ancestry testing.

T1  - The Gap between Public Preferences and Policies on Immigration: A Comparative Examination of the Effect of Politicisation on Policy Congruence
AN  - 2076972757
AB  - The existence of a gap between public preferences for more restrictive immigration policies and relatively expansive immigration policy in Western democracies has received considerable attention. Sometimes, this gap has been explained by the nature of immigration policies: dominated by elites while the public remained uninterested. In many countries, however, immigration has gained considerable salience among the public. There are competing expectations and accounts relating to whether policy-makers ignore or follow public demands on immigration. In this article we examine the potential drivers of variations in the opinion-policy gap on immigration in seven countries (1995-2010). We analyse the effect of the politicisation of immigration on this opinion-policy gap. The strength of anti-immigrant parties is unrelated to the opinion-policy gap on immigration. The salience of the issue and the intensity of the public debate are associated with the opinion-policy gap, and the combination of negative attitudes with extensive media coverage seems particularly conducive to policy congruence.

T1  - Group-based discrimination, national identification, and British Muslims' attitudes toward non-Muslims: the mediating role of perceived identity incompatibility
AN  - 1685140999
AB  - In two studies, we tested a model in which the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim (identity incompatibility) was expected to mediate between group-based discrimination and the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims. In Study 1 (N = 76), anti-Muslim discrimination was associated with lower national identification and more negative attitudes toward non-Muslims, and these relationships were mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. In Study 2 (N = 70), we additionally found that anti-Muslim discrimination predicted stronger endorsement of Islamic group rights, and this relationship was also mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. The studies highlight the importance of group-based discrimination in shaping the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim, and, in turn, the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims.

T1  - Finding God in Global Politics: IPSR
AN  - 1933640334
AB  - The literature on religion and international politics has expanded in reaction to the events iconically known as '9/11', said to cast doubt on the 'secularisation thesis', which dominated the social sciences' approach to religion until the 1980s. The four books under review begin by assessing the secularisation premise, before amassing data to demonstrate the ways in which 'religion' (however conceived) influences or is suppressed by governments, inflames or mediates conflicts, shapes voter attitudes and political cultures, and so on. With one exception, the authors devote little attention to defining 'religion' or to delineating what differentiates it from other categories such as 'politics', 'culture', or 'ethnicity'. What 'religion' refers to, and how it relates to the 'secular', has been the subject of detailed, technical debate within the discipline of religious studies since 1962, but this literature is largely invisible in the four reviewed texts. The result is an enormous body of data which will overturn many enduring stereotypes; but whose usefulness is, in some cases, limited by the fact that the studies ultimately demonstrate that researchers tend to find what they go looking for.

T1  - Television on Women's Empowerment in India
AN  - 1667948558; 201510291
AB  - We used a nationwide demographic survey to study the relation between television exposure and women's empowerment in India. Ordinary least squares (OLS) results suggested that TV exposure improved Indian women's status. We used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to mitigate the potential threat of endogeneity. The results indicate that TV exposure is correlated with greater awareness of autonomy, greater financial independence, less unwanted pregnancy (birth control), negative attitude toward beating, a lower tendency of giving birth, a smaller family, and a lower preference level for sons.

T1  - Attitude of Iranian Female University Students to Sport and Exercise
AN  - 1660022993; 201506537
AB  - Women's sport has always been a challenging subject in Muslim countries and Muslim women have had to face various constraints regarding their participation in sport and exercise, which also influence their attitudes to sport. This study aims to explore the attitude of Iranian female university students toward sport by survey method (N = 1,120) and qualitative interviews (N = 50). The results indicate that the majority of the participants have negative attitudes to sport, and accordingly they do not practice it. Various macro-, meso- and micro-level factors were found as perceived barriers. From the results it can be concluded that the media as a tool for raising awareness to providing role models and shaping the social values of mainstream society does not take a positive role in order to develop the culture of women's sport, and to change the attitude of female students and their social environments to sport in Iranian society.

T1  - Badly off or better off than them? The impact of relative deprivation and relative gratification on intergroup discrimination
AN  - 1622296164; 201438409
AB  - This research examines for the 1st time the effects of relative deprivation and relative gratification, based on social comparison, on implicit and overt forms of discrimination toward the outgroup in a minimal group setting. Study 1 showed that compared to a control condition, relative deprivation and relative gratification enhanced implicit discrimination -- measured through variations of linguistic abstraction in intergroup descriptions. Whereas both relative deprivation and relative gratification produced linguistic ingroup favoritism, linguistic productions of relatively deprived groups also conveyed outgroup derogation. Study 2 showed that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups were overtly discriminatory in intergroup allocations of negative outcomes. The effects of relative deprivation were mediated by perceived intergroup rivalry and, in part, by perceived common fate. Perceived common fate partly accounted for the effects of relative gratification. Study 3 focused on mediators of relative gratification. First, members of relatively gratified (vs. control) groups worried about losing the ingroup advantage, which together worked as sequential mediators of discrimination. Second, relatively gratified groups reported higher existential guilt, which, in turn, was related to expectations of discrimination by the relatively deprived outgroup, and these sequentially mediated the effects of relative gratification. Overall, these studies highlight that both relative deprivation and relative gratification enhance intergroup discrimination and contribute to the understanding of the underlying processes.

T1  - DISTINCT EFFECTS OF IMAGINE-OTHER VERSUS IMAGINE-SELF PERSPECTIVE-TAKING ON PREJUDICE REDUCTION
AN  - 1551000269; 201429140
AB  - Two experiments tested the hypothesis that imagine-other and imagine-self perspective-taking have different implications for prejudice reduction when instantiated in intergroup exchanges characterized by the potential for evaluation. We reasoned that because imagine-other perspective-taking is more likely than imagine-self perspective-taking to lead individuals to an unproductive focus on how they themselves are evaluated, imagine-other perspective-taking would hinder prejudice reduction whereas imagine-self perspective-taking would not. Results across two different intergroup relationships were consistent with these predictions and further suggested that the negative implications of imagine-other perspective-taking were mediated by relative meta-stereotype activation, an index of the extent to which individuals focused more on how their own group was viewed than on their view of the outgroup. These findings highlight that considering how individuals' concerns with evaluation guide their thoughts and experiences during intergroup exchanges can help identify the likely effects of different intervention strategies in such contexts.

T1  - Promoting Civil Discourse Through Search Engine Diversity
AN  - 1531934075; 201422706
AB  - The ability of modern web services such as news aggregators and search engines to tailor their results to the tastes of individuals, together with people's preference for reading opinions which reinforce their own viewpoints, have raised concerns that people are nowadays exposed to a narrow range of view-points, a phenomenon referred to as the 'filter bubble'. In this paper we focus on increasing exposure to varied political opinions with a goal of improving civil discourse. We develop a method to algorithmically encourage people to read diverse political opinions and test it when people actively seek information. First, analyzing data from a popular search engine we show that people are indeed more likely to read opinions consistent with their own. Interestingly, they are more likely to read news from opposing sites when the language model of a particular news item is close to the language model of their own political leaning. Based on this finding, we describe a method for assisting people to read divergent opinions by choosing documents of opposing viewpoints that have a language model closer to their own language model. We test our method on a number of web searchers and show that pages of the opposing side which were more similar than the average persons' own language model tended to be clicked 38% more than those below. We also describe the long-term effects of our method, showing that people who were shown more diverse results continued reading more diverse results and overall became more interested in news.

T1  - STIGMA TOWARDS PLWHA: THE ROLE OF INTERNALIZED HOMOSEXUAL STIGMA IN LATINO GAY/BISEXUAL MALE AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1512218380; 201410430
AB  - Stigma negatively affects the health of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Negative attitudes and discriminatory actions towards PLWHA are thought to be based, among other factors, on stigma towards sexual minorities and beliefs about personal responsibility. Yet, there is little evidence to support these linkages and explain how they take place, especially among Latinos. This study analyzes attitudes towards PLWHA among 643 Latino gay/bisexual men and transgender (GBT) people. It examines whether discriminatory actions are predicted by beliefs about personal responsibility and internalized homosexual stigma. Results indicate that Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA is associated with HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs and Internalized Homosexual Stigma. Further, HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs partially mediates the relationship between Internalized Homosexual Stigma and Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA. Latino GBT persons who have internalized negative views about homosexuality may project those onto PLWHA. They may think PLWHA are responsible for their serostatus and, hence, deserving of rejection.

T1  - Justifying discrimination against Muslim immigrants: Out-group ideology and the five-step social identity model
AN  - 1438553802; 201340142
AB  - This study examines how Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Party For Freedom (PVV) in the Netherlands, justifies discriminatory measures for Muslim citizens. Wilders' contributions to four parliamentary debates and newspaper articles are analysed. The analysis shows that Wilders consistently makes a distinction between Islam as a belief system and Muslims as a group of people. Islam is defined as external to the West and as a major threat to the virtuous nature of the in-group. Defending and preserving Western liberal values against Islam is construed as a moral imperative. It is further shown how the distinction between Islam and Muslims functions to ward off accusations of prejudice and discrimination. It is concluded that social psychologists studying prejudice and discrimination should pay more attention to the distinction between person categories and ideological categories, and to political leadership.

T1  - Explicit and implicit attitudes of Scottish and Maltese children to national identity
AN  - 1373430246; 201329751
AB  - This paper utilised a combination of explicit and implicit techniques to investigate the ways in which children aged 5-16 from two small European nation-states develop in-group favouritism, and positive and/or negative attitudes towards other nation-states. The study adopted a combination of data collection approaches to gain greater evaluation of variability in the responses obtained. Data were analysed statistically for both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings show self-regulation of overt negativity and clearly demonstrate some disquieting outcomes. It poses questions of the extent to which social norms of xenophobia and racism disseminated to children through access to an adult directed media; and what interventions might diminish out-group negativity and prejudice whilst maintaining a level of in-group favouritism that delivers personal self-esteem, and provides the basis for national regard that does not compromise the rights of others.

T1  - Perceptions of smokers influence nonsmoker attitudes and preferences for interactions
AN  - 1433109347
AB  - In two studies, we examined nonsmokers' perceptions of smokers and consequences of the perceptions. In Study 1, smokers answered questions about their sense of self, dependence on smoking, and motivation to quit. Nonsmokers answered questions about their perceptions of these characteristics. Differences between smokers' self-descriptions and nonsmokers' perceptions were observed. Study 2 asked nonsmokers to judge two types of smokers for which the descriptions were based on Study 1 findings. Results showed that nonsmokers held a more negative attitude about and were less willing to engage in different close relationships with the smoker who was described in terms of nonsmokers' perceptions rather than smokers' reports. Attitude mediated the relationship between type of smoker and willingness to date a smoker.

T1  - Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage
AN  - 1347783254; 201321499
AB  - This study examines the effect that the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, congregations, and friendships has on whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage with blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Utilizing survey data drawn from a national probability sample, ordered logit regression models are estimated in order to (1) determine the effect of the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, and congregations on white intermarriage attitudes, net of sociodemographic and ideological controls and (2) test for a mediating effect of interracial friendship. Greater presence of blacks, Latinos, or Asians in neighborhoods and congregations of whites predicts favorable attitudes among whites toward interracial marriage with each respective racial group. A higher proportion of Latinos in the workplace also predicts support for racial exogamy with Latinos. Many of these effects, however, are reduced when interracial friendship is included in models, suggesting that the effect of interracial contact on intermarriage attitudes is mediated by whether or not whites develop interracial friendships within settings of cross-race interaction.

T1  - US host nationals' attitudes toward Japanese: the role of communication and relational solidarity in the intergroup contact hypothesis
AN  - 1373428425; 201328620
AB  - Guided by the intergroup contact hypothesis and intergroup contact theory, the authors examined US Americans' (N = 403) communication experiences and relational solidarity with their most frequent Japanese contact and associations with their attitudes toward Japanese as a cultural group. Structure Equation Modeling (SEM) results showed that both communication frequency and quality had an indirect effect through relational solidarity on affective, behavioral, and cognitive attitudes, demonstrating the critical mediating role of relational solidarity. Results also revealed that communication quality was positively and directly associated with the attitudinal measures. Implications of the findings are discussed with respect to prior literature on relational communication in intergroup and intercultural contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Violence Against Women in Video Games: A Prequel or Sequel to Rape Myth Acceptance
AN  - 1364700878; 201327530
AB  - Current research suggests a link between negative attitudes toward women and violence against women, and it also suggests that media may condition such negative attitudes. When considering the tremendous and continued growth of video game sales, and the resulting proliferation of sexual objectification and violence against women in some video games, it is lamentable that there is a dearth of research exploring the effect of such imagery on attitudes toward women. This study is the first study to use actual video game playing and control for causal order, when exploring the effect of sexual exploitation and violence against women in video games on attitudes toward women. By employing a Solomon Four-Group experimental research design, this exploratory study found that a video game depicting sexual objectification of women and violence against women resulted in statistically significant increased rape myths acceptance (rape-supportive attitudes) for male study participants but not for female participants.

T1  - How does Intergroup Contact Generate Ethnic Tolerance? The Contact Hypothesis in a Scandinavian Context
AN  - 1081865415; 201235234
AB  - As European majority members are often hostile toward ethnic minorities, it is important to identify sources that reduce opposition to immigrants. First, focusing on Denmark, this article examines whether intergroup contact influences attitudes toward ethnic minority rights (henceforth: "ethnic tolerance"). Second, this study tests whether the contact-tolerance relationship is mediated by self-disclosure and symbolic threat. Furthermore, contact is measured as workplace contact in order to reduce self-selection biases. The empirical tests are performed on a Danish high-quality national probability sample from 2009 (N = 1,929). Analysis shows that intergroup contact generates ethnic tolerance because workplace contact weakens threat perceptions and stimulates disclosure of personal information. Generally, these results suggest that regular intergroup contact can improve ethnic relations in contemporary democracies. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1023026660; 201223726
AB  - The current study examines the inherent biases about sexual offending held by 123 laypersons and 120 professionals (i.e. probation officers and therapists). In order to determine the extent of these biases, a series of brief newspaper articles were constructed to depict cases of sexual offenders. Each article comprised several combinations of key variables, including offender type, level of admission, and the presence of alcohol. Participants read a series of three fabricated articles and then completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes about the various offenders. The results indicate important differences between the lay and professional samples. Laypersons deemed sex offenders more favourably in terms of character, accountability, and risk for sexual recidivism. However, both groups showed some similar perceptions about sexual offending. Specifically, both groups evaluated child molesters more negatively than exhibitionists and in some cases, rapists. These findings highlight the need for continuing education for professionals in order to attenuate the effects of prejudicial attitudes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Race, Immigration, and Policing: Chinese Immigrants' Satisfaction with Police
AN  - 925712178; 201205787
AB  - A considerable body of research focuses on racial and ethnic minorities' perceptions of police, yet non-Black, non-Hispanic minority groups, Asians in particular, are largely overlooked. Meanwhile, despite a fast growing immigrant population and the increasing demand on local police to enforce immigration law, research on police-immigrant relations remains limited. Using data from over 400 Chinese immigrants, this study examines the issues of race/ethnicity, immigration, and policing with a focal concern on Chinese immigrants' attitudes toward police. Results indicate that the majority of Chinese immigrants rate police positively in overall performance and specific areas of effectiveness, integrity, and demeanor. Both universal and immigrant-specific factors are important predictors of immigrants' attitudes. Chinese immigrants' evaluations of police are not only affected by exposure to media coverage of police misconduct, neighborhood conditions, and city context, but also are intertwined with their opinions of their home country police and perceptions of US immigration authorities.

T1  - Emotional distress about weight gain and attitude to goal achievement failure as predictors of self-regulatory efficacy: Does ethnicity make a difference?
AN  - 1928272535
AB  - In spite of alarming increases in obesity, little is known concerning the influence of emotional distress about weight gain on perceived self-efficacy in maintaining self-control when controlling for racial identity. This study found that emotional distress toward goal achievement failure mediated the influence of ethnicity on perceived self-efficacy in resisting eating temptations. White females reporting higher emotional distress about weight gain than their black counterparts displayed lower self-regulatory efficacy, particularly when negative emotions were involved. Negative attitudes toward goal achievement failure among whites played a critical role in undermining perceived self-regulatory efficacy. The implications for public policy are discussed.

T1  - Is anal sex a marker for sexual risk-taking? Results from a population-based study of young Croatian adults
AN  - 1030869079; 201229645
AB  - Background: There is evidence that anal sex is becoming increasingly popular among heterosexual women and men. Several studies carried out in especially vulnerable populations (e.g. sex workers and low-income youth) suggested that anal sex may indicate a more general propensity to sexual risk-taking. Methods: To assess whether this epidemiologically important finding holds in the case of young adults from the general population, we analysed data from a cross-sectional probability survey carried out in 2010 on 1005 Croatian women and men aged 18-25. Results: Anal intercourse was reported by 36.5% of 86l sexually experienced participants (42.7% of men and 29.8% of women). About one-third of them (34%) used a condom at most recent anal intercourse. The experience of anal sex was significantly associated (P< 0.001) with all four indicators of sexual risk-taking (condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse, number of sexual partners in the past year, concurrent sexual relationships and anonymous sex in the past year), as well as with negative attitudes and beliefs about condom use (P< 0.01). Sexual sensation-seeking mediated the relationship between anal sex and some of the sexual risk-taking behaviours. Conclusion: According to the findings, heterosexual anal sex is directly and indirectly associated with increased behavioural risks of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STI). Sex education and STI prevention programs should focus on the importance of using protection when practicing anal sex. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Explaining relationships between ethnic diversity and informal social capital across European countries and regions: Tests of constrict, conflict and contact theory
AN  - 887501262; 201118189
AB  - In this study we focus on the relationship between ethnic diversity and informal social capital. As this refers to rather strong social ties in the intimate domain, it is a strict test of Putnam's claim that ethnic diversity would decrease social capital. In order to explain these relationships, we derived mediating mechanisms from conflict and contact theory. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we applied multilevel analyses considering three levels: individuals, regions and countries. Our results revealed a direct positive effect of ethnic diversity at the country level on informal helping, yet no indirect effect via the mediating variables. At the regional level, we only found an indirect effect of ethnic diversity. Here, ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of intergroup contact that in turn is positively related to both informal social meeting and helping. Perceived ethnic threat turned out to have a negative effect on informal social meeting. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - 'Simon Cowell for prime minister'? Young citizens' attitudes towards celebrity politics
AN  - 1928294158
AB  - The merging of celebrity and politics is becoming an established element of democratic political culture. Drawing on our own empirical research with first-time voters in the UK, we want to contribute to this debate. Specifically we ask whether, for young citizens, celebrities are an alternative to current political processes and a democratizing force capable of engaging them in the politics of the public sphere. Young people are a particularly interesting example. While disconnected from main-stream forms of political participation, such as voting and party membership (Fahmy, 2003), young people’s lives are strongly connected with the cultural industries that drive the production of celebrity. Our argument engages with those authors who suggest that popular culture has the potential to energize the public sphere.

T1  - Environmental Determinants of Racial Attitudes Redux: The Critical Decisions Related to Operationalizing Context
AN  - 896165072; 201120189
AB  - Although scholars have long been interested in how context shapes racial attitudes, research in this area has fallen short of a consensus. Instead, the results span a wide range, with some studies finding that racial understanding is promoted by intergroup contact whereas others claim that racial and ethnic outgroups are perceived as a threat to economic and political interests. These varying results arise from research rooted in different conceptualizations of context. Our analysis is unique in the attention we pay to the measure of context for our particular data set. Employing a sociodemographic definition of neighborhood social context, we find that contextual socioeconomic status plays a critical role in mediating the effects of intergroup contact on racial attitudes. These contacts are more likely to produce racial harmony in high-status neighborhoods than in neighborhoods marked by low income and low levels of education.

T1  - Mental Health Stigma, Self-Concealment, and Help-Seeking Attitudes among Asian American and European American College Students with No Help-Seeking Experience
AN  - 1081866077; 201237403
AB  - The present study examined whether mental health stigma (i.e., negative attitudes toward people with a psychological disorder) and self-concealment are unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes in Asian American and European American college students with no history of seeking professional psychological services. The Asian American group had less favorable help-seeking attitudes overall, lower levels of stigma tolerance and interpersonal openness, greater mental health stigma, and greater self-concealment than the European American group. Mental health stigma and self-concealment were unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes overall in both groups. However, mental health stigma was not a unique predictor of recognition of need for psychotherapeutic help and confidence in mental health practitioners, the components of help-seeking attitudes theorized to be most associated with actual help-seeking behavior. Self-concealment was a unique predictor of confidence in mental health practitioners in the Asian American group, but not in the European American group. Adapted from the source document.

To date, many studies have focused on modeling the stress and coping process for the individual, isolated from the family. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to investigate a cross-sectional stress and coping model for HIV-positive African-American mothers recruited from HIV service facilities in South Florida (n=214) and their family members (n=294). Avoidance coping was hypothesized to mediate the relationship between stress and psychological distress. In addition, the family average of individual stress was hypothesized to moderate the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress. For all constructs, individuals reported on themselves and multilevel modeling techniques were used to account for similarities between members of the same family. The estimated mediation effect was significant. Aggregated family stress significantly moderated the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress. This study suggests that individuals exhibit different relationships between avoidance coping and psychological outcomes and that average stress reported by members of a family moderates the relationship between avoidance coping and psychological distress.

T1  - For God (or) Country: The Hydraulic Relation Between Government Instability and Belief in Religious Sources of Control
AN  - 822521874; 201074662
AB  - It has been recently proposed that people can flexibly rely on sources of control that are both internal and external to the self to satisfy the need to believe that their world is under control (i.e., that events do not unfold randomly or haphazardly). Consistent with this, past research demonstrates that, when personal control is threatened, people defend external systems of control, such as God and government. This theoretical perspective also suggests that belief in God and support for governmental systems, although seemingly disparate, will exhibit a hydraulic relationship with one another. Using both experimental and longitudinal designs in Eastern and Western cultures, the authors demonstrate that experimental manipulations or naturally occurring events (e.g., electoral instability) that lower faith in one of these external systems (e.g., the government) lead to subsequent increases in faith in the other (e.g., God). In addition, mediation and moderation analyses suggest that specific concerns with order and structure underlie these hydraulic effects. Implications for the psychological, sociocultural, and sociopolitical underpinnings of religious faith, as well as system justification theory, are discussed.

T1  - Taming of the casino dragon
AN  - 758121968; 201059043
AB  - The Gambling Act 2005 reformed the gambling market with far-reaching implications for the market as a whole, and casino gambling in particular. A small survey was conducted in Swansea to review community perceptions of casinos in their locality. This paper examines the alleged benefits of gambling and to discuss the concern that the Gambling Act will be likely to harm those who are most deprived and vulnerable in society. This paper explores the advantages and disadvantages to the establishment of a casino and its perceived impacts on local families and communities. Issues such as fear of an increase in crime and increases in poverty, ill-health and family breakdown were all important to respondents and are discussed in this paper. In summary, the majority of all respondents had a negative attitude towards gambling, which reflects the findings of the British Gambling Prevalence Survey. During conversations it became evident that the respondents' attitudes towards the casino gambling were formed based on their perceptions and images of a casino and the gambling industry in general. A lot of respondents said that their perceptions of Internet gambling were predominantly based on the media reporting. Some of the respondents mentioned that their personal gambling experiences and observations had also shaped their opinions on the survey responses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The effectiveness of intergroup contact at work: Mediators and moderators of hospital workers' prejudice towards immigrants
AN  - 743066506; 201043329
AB  - The present research examines the effectiveness of intergroup contact between 167 Italian hospital workers and foreign patients in reducing prejudice towards immigrants in general. The outcomes of contact at work were analysed controlling for the influence of contact outside the workplace and through mass media, and taking into account the role of empathy, anxiety and group membership salience. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the influence of contact on intergroup emotions. These findings show that contact at work can be a powerful means to reduce prejudice, thanks to its capacity to evoke changes in affective responses. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - An Expectancy/Value Perspective on the Demotivating Effects of Prejudice
AN  - 1866473495
AB  - This study examined whether expecting prejudice is demotivating. Women were led to believe they were being evaluated for a co-manager position. They were randomly assigned to receive information that the evaluator held negative attitudes toward women or that he did not. We hypothesized that compared to women led to believe that the evaluator was unprejudiced, women led to believe the evaluator was prejudiced would: (a) have lower expectations for being chosen as co-manager; (b) place less value on being chosen as co-manager; and (c) be less motivated to perform a task that would influence selection as co-manager. We predicted that the effect of prejudice on motivation would be mediated by expectations and valuing of success. Results were consistent with predictions.

T1  - A Million Dollar Exit from the Anarchic Slum-world: Slumdog Millionaire's hollow idioms of social justice
AN  - 754037723; 201050336
AB  - This article contests the characterisation of the popular and acclaimed film, Slumdog Millionaire, as a realistic portrayal of India's urban poverty that will ultimately serve as a tool of advocacy for India's urban poor. It argues that the film's reductive view of slum-spaces will more probably reinforce negative attitudes towards slum-dwellers, lending credibility to the sorts of policies that have historically dispossessed them of power and dignity. By drawing attention to the film's celebration of characters and spaces that symbolise Western culture and Northern trajectories of 'development', the article also critically engages with some of the issues raised by the film's enormous success.

T1  - Rally Effects, Threat, and Attitude Change: An Integrative Approach to Understanding the Role of Emotion
AN  - 743067055; 201043084
AB  - Rally 'round the flag effects (J. E. Mueller, 1970) represent sudden and dramatically powerful situation-specific shifts in attitudes toward the American president. However, the extant literature has yet to fully clarify the nature of the psychological dynamics associated with this effect. These ambiguities reflect fundamental differences of opinion among scholars on some very basic questions such as whether overtly experienced emotion should mediate these attitudinal shifts or whether these changes reflect more general shifts in conservative ideology. Across 4 experiments, the authors sought to gain greater clarity on these and other important matters using a multimethod approach in which the authors varied whether participants viewed documentary footage of the 9/11 attacks (Experiments 1-2), generated autobiographical memories of that event (Experiment 3), or retrieved nonpolitical memories from their past (Experiment 4). The authors discuss the relevance of the present findings for theory and research across a variety of different theoretical and methodological paradigms, including social psychological models of threat, emotional appraisal models, and the political science literature.
