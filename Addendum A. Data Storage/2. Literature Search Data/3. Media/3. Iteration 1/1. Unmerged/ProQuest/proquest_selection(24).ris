T1  - The source model of group threat: Responding to internal and external threats
AN  - 2183653192
AB  - We introduce a model of group threat that articulates the opposing effects of intergroup (between-groups) and intragroup (within-group) threat on identity processes and group relations. The source model of group threat argues that the perceived source of a threat is critical in predicting its consequences, such that perceptions of intergroup threat will strengthen (in)group identity processes and relations, whereas perceptions of intragroup threat has the potential to undermine the same. In addition to reviewing the large literature on intergroup threat and a smaller body of unsynthesized work on intragroup threat, we discuss how these processes are captured in representations of monsters (aliens, vampires, and zombies) in popular media and how these ideas can inform interpretation of current political debates, such as those around homegrown terrorism. This model provides a novel summary of the core effects of intergroup and intragroup threat, generating testable hypotheses about the psychological effects of different types of threat. Applying this model will help to make sense of seemingly contradictory findings in the literature, illustrating how appraisal of a threat as originating from an intergroup or intragroup source has the capacity to change the group-based effects of that threat.

T1  - “They've conspired against us”: Understanding the role of social identification and conspiracy beliefs in justification of ingroup collective behavior
AN  - 2133256884
AB  - The present research investigates conditions under which beliefs in conspiracy theories predict the desire to justify ingroup behavior in the context of intergroup conflict. We propose that within the context of Ukraine's intergroup conflict over the annexation of Crimea, supporters (but not opponents) of the “Euromaidan” social movement are likely to validate protesters’ collective actions as just to the extent that they believe that the authorities are engaged in annexation‐related conspiracies. We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model—identification with “Euromaidan” increased beliefs in the annexation‐related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters’ actions in the setting of intergroup conflict. However, this mediation was only observed among those supporters of the Euromaidan who perceived political corruption to be at a low or average level.

T1  - Natasha Warikoo's The Diversity Bargain and Other Dilemmas on Race, Admissions, and Meritocracy at Elite Universities
AN  - 1930436680
AB  - The publication of Natasha Warikoo’s book helped to bring to the fore once again the issue of the role that race plays in relation to admissions to elite universities. This has been the subject of public and media debate in recent years, particularly in the wider context of concerns that elite institutions in the higher education sector were not doing enough to address questions about race and other inequalities in their admission processes. We felt as editors that it would be useful to discuss the core arguments to be found in Warikoo’s account and we therefore invited scholars to provide their critical take on the book. The resulting Symposium brings together six commentaries by David Karen, Joshua Klugman, Nicola Rollock, Sarah Neal, Kalwant Bhopal, and Joseph Soares. It is interesting to note that although all six focus on specific aspects of Warikoo’s findings, they also agree on the significance of the core questions that she seeks to address. At the end of the Symposium, we are also pleased to include Warikoo’s response to some of the key arguments that are raised by the six symposiasts. We hope that our readers will find this exchange of interest and, indeed, we look forward to seeing the issues covered by this exchange explored further in the pages of the journal.

T1  - Studying Prince: An Introduction
AN  - 1945566306
AB  - The primary responsibility of the scholar is to put in historical, political, and social context that which has not only shaped our thinking about people, places, things, and events, but give meaning to them. For nearly 40 years, Prince was a mainstay in the world of music and pop culture, but there was more to Prince than just music. For Prince, music was a vessel through which he urged listeners to think about matters such as masculinity, spirituality, politics, racial and gender equality, gang violence, sexuality, poverty, disease,and identity. It was not surprising then that when reports of Prince’s death were broadcast on April 21, 2016, the world mourned. Tributes of varying kind were posted all over social media; city halls, bridges, buildings, and skylines around the world were lit up in purple; fans flocked to and gathered outside his residence in Chanhassen, a Minneapolis suburb; scores of artists paid homage to Prince by covering his songs in concerts; even multinational corporations such as Chevrolet got in on the act with a moving, and yet subtle 30-second tribute to the icon’s 1982 hit Little Red Corvette. In the days, weeks, and months that followed, Prince appeared on the cover of countless magazines. It seemed that tributes poured in from every industry imaginable, with the exception of academia. Less than two weeks after Prince’s death, I, a Professor of African American and African Studies at The Ohio State University sought to remedy that. I reached out to Shannon Cochran, a colleague whose academic training intersects Africana Studies, English Literature, and Women’s and Gender Studies, who happily agreed to collaborate. I thought it important that Africana Studies scholars lead this charge as they are uniquely positioned to do so. Within all of academia, Africana Studies is arguably the most interdisciplinary field of inquiry. Moreover, the mission of the Africana Studies scholar is appreciably different than that of other academics. Not only is it the Africana Studies scholar’s responsibility to study the Black experience with the express purpose of excavating that which has been deliberately or unwittingly marginalized, misrepresented, and denied historical acclaim, but also to do so in a way that raises people’s consciousness and moves people to action (i.e., creating solutions to the many problems that plague African descended people everywhere).

T1  - Prince Rogers Nelson: from “Dirty Mind” to Devout Jehovah’s Witness
AN  - 1945565206
AB  - Prince Rogers Nelson (born: June 7, 1958) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and actor. He was a musical innovator and known for his eclectic work, flamboyant stage presence, extravagant dress and makeup, and wide vocal range. When he passed unexpectedly on April 21, 2016, he had built an immensely successful career that spanned over 30 years. Although Prince is widely known for his highly sexual behavior, we know less about his spiritual beliefs as well as how these beliefs influenced his public persona and private life. Through the lens of social identity theory, this manuscript will examine how Prince demonstrated his belief in God, his values, and the changes that he made in his life after he became a devout Jehovah’s Witness. In particular, this manuscript will provide song lyrics and excerpts from televised and print interviews to qualitatively respond to the following three questions: (1) How did Prince demonstrate his belief in God in his music? (2) What were Prince’s values? (3) What changes did Prince make in his public performances after he became a Jehovah’s Witness?

T1  - Producing and Consuming Inequality: A Cultural Sociology of the Cultural Industries
AN  - 1931471951
AB  - I’ve been saying that Tarell and I are that kid in the film, and that kid does not grow up to make a piece of art that gets eight Academy Award nominations. It’s a dream I never allowed myself to have. When we were sitting there, and that dream of winning didn’t come true, I took it off the table. But then I had to very quickly get back into that place. Barry Jenkins  -- Chaos and confusion marked the award for best picture at the 2017 Oscar ceremony.Moonlight, a film made by a black filmmaker that placed at its centre the normally marginalised experiences of black gay men, was initially not announced as the winner. Rather, due to an error by the consultancy tasked with organising the envelopes, La La Land, a tribute to a bygone age of Hollywood musicals, was initially presented with the award. In the opening quotation above, Moonlight’s director Barry Jenkins narrates his sense of disorientation at the announcement. His words also betray a sense of being out of place or in a dream at the idea of winning Academy Awards for a marginalised story by a filmmaker from a marginalised sector of the American population. That moment distils many of the themes of our special issue, which looks at the exclusions and inequalities within the cultural and creative industries, and how these inequalities relate to broader social divisions. ‘If you can’t see it, you can’t be it’. This well-worn phrase has underpinned a flurry of recent controversies around the cultural industries that have become persistent and wide ranging across almost every part of the sector. There are numerous examples: outrage at the stubborn racial and gender inequalities in the cinema and video games industries,captured by #oscarssowhite and #gamergate; the media and online debates over accusations of whitewashing of leading Asian characters in blockbuster films Dr Strange and Ghost in the Shell; Kim Gordon’s comments on the two steps forward, one step back experience of women in the popular music industry; the controversial resignation of Emma Rice from the Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in London; and the assertions and counter claims as to the benefits, particularly over pay rates and access to parts, of privileged backgrounds for those working in British theatre.In this context there is opportunity and responsibility for sociologists to respond to these controversies and debates, and to inform research agendas to support progressive social values in the cultural industries. Whilst questions of getting in and getting on are common to professions across nations in the Global North, they are particularly pressing in those occupations and industrial sectors involved in producing culture. This is because cultural industries are crucial to creating representations of individuals, communities and nation states.However, the production of representations, and their subsequent consumption, is socially patterned. Thus there is a profoundly sociological element to debates and discussions such as #oscarssowhite, ‘class ceilings’ in acting, and sexism in the music industry. Here it is vital to develop the existing body of sociological work grappling with the social patterning and social inequality in production, representation and consumption of culture.

T1  - The Impact of Police Deployment on Racial Disparities in Discretionary Searches
AN  - 1907053307
AB  - A large and growing body of research finds racial disparities in discretionary searches of drivers during traffic stops with Black drivers disproportionately involved in these investigations. Among the explanations for these disparities is the deployment hypothesis which suggests that as police departments increasingly adopt hot spots policing strategies, proactive traffic stops and discretionary searches may spatially cluster around crime hot spots contributing to racial disparities. The present study builds on the existing research literature by identifying hot spots using reported crime data from a police department and examining whether these crime hot spots function as a mediating factor to the relationship between driver race and discretionary searches. Findings provide partial support for the deployment hypothesis. While nearly half of all traffic stops transpired within one quarter mile of hot spots and more frequently involved Black drivers, stops involving Black drivers remained more likely to include discretionary searches and increased concomitantly with distance from the nearest hot spot.

T1  - "But Oh! What Tales": Portraying the Middle East in U.S. Homophile Periodicals of the 1950s and 1960s
AN  - 1891114220
AB  - This essay examines Middle East representations in U.S. homophile periodicals from 1953 to 1964. The essay uses more than 120 Middle East-related items that were published in ONE, Mattachine Review, and The Ladder to address the periodicals' engagement with the region (particularly ancient history and biblical themes) and discuss the types of sexual "knowledge" that the homophile periodicals created about the region. It then assesses the role of periodicals as a genre in the creation of a transnational homophile community, showing both their potential for democratizing participation in this community and their limits. The essay argues that the periodicals made visible the process of assembling a homosexual identity and the fragmentary nature of the parts it strove to unify. Though the views of key U.S. homophile organizations became hegemonic in the international gay rights movement, the periodicals show a more complex, ambivalent, and contested process.

T1  - Representational Contamination: How Does an Unexpected Armed Encounter Psychologically Stunt a Peace Process?
AN  - 1961001108
AB  - The concept of representational contamination is introduced to account for psychological changes in the public sphere after a local armed clash deflects a national peace process. Although representational contamination is fundamentally psychological, our conceptualization of this phenomenon merges ideas from other social science disciplines such as media communication, political derailment, and intergroup conflict. We push psychology to more macro layers of analyses, and increase its theoretical utility for social issues such as peace and conflict. As a case in point, we take the Muslim-Christian peace process in the Philippines, as positive representations of the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL) shift dramatically and negatively after an armed clash in the remote municipality of Mamasapano. Our research innovates a methodological mix of qualitative and quantitative strategies to access natural data in the real world, obtain mathematical accuracy, and add discursive depth. We employ a sequential mixed methods strategy on a data corpus of 178 news reports about the BBL, 5 weeks before and 5 weeks after the Mamasapano clash. Text-mining calculations yield word association scores of support (range 57%-89%) and confidence (consistently 100%), indicating a high discursive overlap between BBL and Mamasapano. Computed word association maps also show how BBL is associated with positive words before Mamasapano and negative words after the military encounter. We end by raising practical questions on how to deal with representational contamination, and discuss issues of psychological containment in the public sphere.

T1  - The Role of Gay Identity Confusion and Outness in Sex-Seeking on Mobile Dating Apps Among Men Who Have Sex With Men: A Conditional Process Analysis
AN  - 1875136752
AB  - Mobile dating apps are now a popular platform for men who have sex with men (MSM) to connect with others. Based on the uses and gratifications (U&G) theory, this study explores the relationship between sex-seeking and the number of casual sex partners met through MSM-based mobile dating apps (Grindr, Jack'd, and SCRUFF). The conditional process analysis (N = 401) shows that this relationship was significant and was mediated by the intensity of app use. That is, sex-seeking indirectly affected the number of casual sex partners through the intensity of app use. Furthermore, gay identity confusion and outness to the world moderated this indirect effect: it was stronger when the user was either more confused about his sexuality or was less out to the world. This research introduces an alternative way to incorporate psychographics variables into the U&G framework.

T1  - Is It Facebook Official? Coming Out and Passing Strategies of Young Adult Gay Men on Social Media
AN  - 1865247436
AB  - The rapid proliferation of social media, mobile applications, and Internet technologies has shifted a wide variety of social interaction from physical spaces to an online environment. Drawing from 42 semistructured, in-depth interviews with gay college-aged men between the ages of 18 and 27, this article explores these changing patterns of social interaction among gay men. I discuss three strategies of identity management college-aged gay men use to disclose or conceal their sexual identity to others. The first group of men, "Out and Proud," uses Facebook as a way to celebrate and reaffirm their sexual identity, in addition to actively coming out to others on the social media Web site. The second group, "Out and Discreet," uses Facebook to indirectly come out to some of their friends while hiding this information from others. The men in the last group I identify, "Facebook Closeted," actively manage their online profiles to ensure their sexual identity is not exposed. Facebook is both transformative and risky for college-aged gay men, as it represents a new platform for them to come out as gay to friends and family, as well as other areas of their lives where they must actively manage the presentation of their sexual identity.

T1  - Associations of Perceived Parental Psychopathology with Mental Health Burden and Lifetime Drug Use in Gay, Bisexual, and other YMSM: The P18 Cohort Study
AN  - 1923041547
AB  - Parental mental health may be a critical component in understanding the overlapping health burdens of mental health symptomatology and drug use in young men who have sex with men (YMSM), yet studies of YMSM have not fully examined these associations. To understand these relationships, data drawn from a study of gay, bisexual, and other YMSM were used to examine associations between perceived parental psychopathology and the health of YMSM. Findings suggest that YMSM reporting at least one parent with perceived depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, or antisocial behavior anytime during their childhoods were more likely to report higher levels of both depressive symptomatology and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those reporting no perception of any of these psychopathologies in their parents. Number of different drugs used in one's life were higher among participants who perceived at least one parent as depressed. Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between perceived parental depression and lifetime drug use of YMSM was mediated both by YMSM depression and YMSM PTSD. These results suggest that parental psychopathology plays an important role in the health of sexual minority men, a population with elevated levels of mental health burden and drug use across the lifespan.

T1  - Immediate Context, Life Experiences, and Perception: How Do Rural Migrants in Urban China Perceive an Unfair Policy?
AN  - 1868945222
AB  - This article examines how rural migrants in China perceive a policy that deprives their children of the opportunity for a high school or college education. In-depth interviews with migrant families in Shanghai reveal that many remain unconvinced that the future of their children is strongly affected by this policy. Rather, they devalue the importance of formal education and emphasize individual effort and alternative pathways to success. By drawing on theories of cognition and the sociology of understanding, I argue that their perceptions of this policy are formed through three processes of validation: recognition of certain views by authorities such as school teachers, social workers, and the media; corroboration with the daily experiences of living in a modern city; and resonance with past experience. This study asserts the importance of immediate context and overall everyday life experiences in shaping perception toward policies. This case also provides insight as to how structural oppression that situates certain individuals in disadvantaged positions is subtly achieved through mechanisms at the microlevel.

T1  - Student migration and polymedia: mainland Chinese students' communication media use in Hong Kong
AN  - 1840854610
AB  - Drawing on qualitative data obtained from mainland Chinese students in Hong Kong, this research uses polymedia theory to analyse the social implications of media use and interpersonal communication by migrant students. It looks at how migrant students use media to communicate with family members and friends in mainland China compared with Hong Kong locals. When communicating with family and friends, their media usage is intense, close and emotion-oriented, forming a warm and supportive virtual network that provides familiarity, a sense of belonging and emotional attachment. In contrast, their media usage to communicate with Hong Kong locals is limited, functional and study-oriented, and although it becomes a platform for practical help, it also demonstrates deep contradictions and conflicts with members of the host society.

T1  - The news framing of the 'Syria fighters' in Flanders and the Netherlands: Victims or terrorists?
AN  - 1840585242
AB  - In this article we present a cross-national comparison of framing of the issue of the 'Syria fighters' in Flanders and the Netherlands. We examine this topic using inductive and deductive framing analysis and interpret the results in terms of the advocates expressing the frames and the newspapers they were published in. We argue that variation in frame use can be explained by considering the background and social identification of the frame advocates. Furthermore, the subject of the 'Syria fighters' is depicted as mostly relating to (Islamic) religious motives and the overall societal construction is relatively one-sided and problematized in a negative sense. This article serves as a preliminary step to a multi-level analysis of societal discourse on integration-related issues in online and offline networks, with an emphasis on Moroccan minorities in Flanders and the Netherlands.

T1  - Is Same-Sex Marriage an Equality Issue? Framing Effects Among African Americans
AN  - 1817459226
AB  - Public opinion about gay rights is often shaped by egalitarian values. While the extant literature has suggested that African Americans' value structure tends to be very egalitarian, many popular media accounts as well as some scholarly research indicate that Blacks have, at times, opposed gay rights. We assert that when the media frame gay rights as equality issues, Blacks are more likely to rely on egalitarianism to form their opinions. We use content analysis to show that equality framing of gay rights dramatically increased in 2012, and we use national survey data to show that Blacks' support for marriage equality also precipitously rose beginning in 2012. Then, we use data from an original framing experiment to show that exposure to an equality frame does, indeed, encourage Blacks to be more reliant on their egalitarian values to form an opinion about same-sex marriage and to be more supportive of the policy.

T1  - Internet racism, journalism and the principle of public access: ethical challenges for qualitative research into 'media attractive' court cases
AN  - 1807591298
AB  - This paper addresses the risk of research exposing people with an immigrant background in criminal court cases to Internet-based racist persecution, due to mismanagement of general ethical guidelines. The principle of informed consent, ideally serving to protect people under study from harm may, in fact, cause them more harm due to the interest among certain Internet-based networks of spreading identifiable, degrading information. Arguments are based on ethically challenging experiences from two ethnographic research projects carried out in Swedish district court environments, focused on immigrant court cases. Ethical advice provided by ethical review boards and established research guidelines, were based on an unawareness of the potentially destructive rendezvous in media attractive immigrant court cases between 'ethically informed' research, crime journalism, freedom of information legislation and 'Internet vigilantes' on a quest to persecute court participants and their families in the global digital arena.

T1  - Different Game, Different Frame?: Black Counterdiscourses and Depictions of Immigration in Atlanta's African-American and Mainstream Press
AN  - 1802482699
AB  - This article compares the discourse on immigration found in Atlanta's African-American press (Atlanta Daily World) to that found in Atlanta's mainstream press (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). The Daily World's black counterdiscourse situates immigration within a racial frame, discussing Latinos and immigrants interchangeably and casting African Americans as deserving yet excluded citizens. Immigrants appear in the Daily World as either allies in the struggle for civil rights or as competitors for jobs. Although the Daily World crime frames focus on concerns about racial profiling, the Journal-Constitution often depicts immigrants as criminals or discusses immigration in terms of legal status and policy.

T1  - Why do Asian Americans academically outperform Whites? - The cultural explanation revisited
AN  - 1793587480
AB  - We advocate an interactive approach to examining the role of culture and SES in explaining Asian Americans' achievement. We use Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) 2002 baseline data to test our proposition that the cultural orientation of Asian American families is different from that of white American families in ways that mediate the effects of family SES on children's academic achievement. The results support our hypothesis, indicating that: (1) SES's positive effects on achievement are stronger among white students than among Asian-Americans; (2) the association between a family's SES and behaviors and attitudes is weaker among Asian-Americans than among Whites; (3) a fraction of the Asian-White achievement gap can be accounted for by ethnic differences in behaviors and attitudes, particularly ethnic differences in family SES's effects on behaviors and attitudes. We find that Asian Americans' behaviors and attitudes are less influenced by family SES than those of Whites are and that this difference helps generate Asians' premium in achievement. This is especially evident at lower levels of family SES. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15300570]

T1  - No Arranged Marriages Here: Migration and the Shift from Relations of Descent to Consent in the Lebanese Diaspora
AN  - 1788992441
AB  - Although frequently debated in the media, few ethnographic studies have examined the dynamics between arranged and love marriages in immigrant communities in Australia. Drawing on Sollors' theory of Consent over Descent and Bourdieu's theory of Masculine Domination, this paper examines the cultural transformation brought about by second-generation daughters in Maronite, Lebanese immigrant families from Hadchit who increasingly choose their own spouse based on love and gender equality. This paper theorises women as subjects, not objects of marriage and asks: how does cultural identity change when women have greater agency in the negotiation of marriage? The study finds three dialectical processes of social change. First, the relation of male domination between the sexes has been destabilised. Second, although marriage contracts based upon female consent have led to a growing preference for exogamous love marriages over endogamous arranged marriages within the village, religious endogamy has remained significant. Last, the study finds an overall decline in village identification; 'Lebanese-Australian' has become the most common form of cultural identification.

T1  - "Homosexuality/Homophobia Is Un-African"?: Un-Mapping Transnational Discourses in the Context of Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Bill/Act
AN  - 1781579257
AB  - This article un-maps the recent impasse between pro- and antigay mobilization around Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA, 2009-2014). Drawing on scholarly and social media sources, it summarizes the increasing influence of (U.S.) transnational evangelism that has precipitated a state-religious complex of "anticipatory political homophobia" in Uganda. If transnational evangelism against same-sex sexuality in Uganda has generated a strong reaction from global LGBT human-rights advocates, this article critiques this Western homotransnationalist response by analyzing its limited terms of operation, focusing on the ways in which Uganda is hailed into the biopolitical project of a Western queer modernity. The author focuses on the copresence between homotransnationalist mobilization and "homophobic anticipatory countermobilization" as (re)organizing/suturing a global ordering project that is deeply invested in biopolitics and necropolitics. This suggests that the global flashpointing of Uganda in the context of the AHA incites further questions concerning the transnationality of "gay human rights" discourse under neoliberalism.

T1  - THE "SICK" RACIST
AN  - 1801833381
AB  - Since the early 1960s, there has been a movement among activists, scholars, and policymakers to redefine racism as a psychopathological condition, identifiable and treatable through psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions. This development reflects, and is reflected by, the popular framing among mass media and ordinary social actors of racism and racist events as individual pathology rather than as a social problem. This shifting perspective on racism, from a social problem and a system to an individual pathology, has increasingly become a part of academic and psychiatric discourse since Jim Crow. In this article, we have two aims: first, to trace the emergence of "psychopathological racism"; second, to illustrate the relationship between "psychopathological racism" and "colorblind racism" in the post-Civil Rights era. We argue that the psychopathological view of racism compliments colorblindness in that larger structural issues are dismissed in favor of individual pathos. Furthermore, psychopathological explanations for racism dismiss socio-political contexts, eschewing the contributions of well over fifty years of social scientific research in the process.

T1  - "It's Irrelevant to Me!" Young Black Women Talk Back to VH1's Love and Hip Hop New York
AN  - 1773820276
AB  - The reality television show Love and Hip Hop New York enjoyed immense popularity during its fourth season. The show, which profiles the love and relationship experiences of its Black and Latino cast, overwhelmingly perpetuates stereotypes of people of color through a narrow lens of Black masculinity and femininity. This article uses critical discourse analysis to unveil the ways in which the show invites its cast members to create hegemonic representations of themselves. It also argues against the effects model in hip-hop scholarship -- which dogmatically asserts that these types of representations are inherently harmful to Black youth. Using audience analysis, the article works to add complexity to the findings of the critical discourse analysis by inviting young Black women to talk back to the representations transmitted by the show.

T1  - Stigma of persons with disabilities in Afghanistan: Examining the pathways from stereotyping to mental distress
AN  - 1774575492
AB  - Despite evidence that stigma of disability is frequently reflected through stereotyping and often results in mental distress, very limited literature demonstrates the pathways through which stereotyping has an impact on mental health. Drawing from a large sample of 1449 participants interviewed between December 2012 and September 2013 from an Afghan community-based rehabilitation program, we examined the structure of stigma associated with disability in Afghanistan. Labeling and negative stereotypes, associated with a specific cause of disability, result in social exclusion that in turn impacts mental health. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examined the mediation effect of stereotypes associated with disability on mental distress and anxiety. We found a mediating role of social exclusion between stereotypes and mental distress but only in the case of persons with disabilities from birth. Comparing the total effect of 'disabled at birth' and mental distress 0.195 (95% CI: 0.018-0.367) the effect size of this mediation effect was 0.293 (95% CI: 0.173-0.415). There was no significant direct effect between 'disabled at birth' and mental distress once mediation effect was accounted for in our model. These findings suggest that a multipronged policy approach that recognizes the driving forces of stigma and promotes social participation directly alongside psychosocial interventions on mental distress of persons with disabilities is necessary to achieve wellbeing for a group that has been historically and systematically excluded from development interventions.

T1  - Framing PIGS: patterns of racism and neocolonialism in the Euro crisis
AN  - 1784145009
AB  - Van Vossole's article explores the racist framing of the peripheral member states of the European Union, the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland (and/or Italy), Greece and Spain). It demonstrates a strong connection between the processes of racialization and depoliticization, as well as the return of colonial dynamics in the Eurozone. Side-stepping political economy and history, the culturalization of politics perfectly complements the 'post-political' neoliberal hegemony. Political and media discourses reproduce it in both populist and corporate interests. The culturalization of politics reduces the differences between centre and periphery to certain 'cultural characteristics and habits', as reflected in stereotypes of laziness, non-productivity, corruption, wasteful spending and lying. These make it possible to blame the PIGS for the current crisis, legitimizing drastic austerity measures and a loss of sovereignty. The loss of sovereignty shows remarkable similarities with what Kwame Nkrumah defined as neocolonialism: the continuation of colonial power relations through processes of economic dependence, conditional aid and cultural hegemony. While this problematic only resurfaced during the recent Euro crisis, Van Vossole discusses how today's racist discourses and neocolonial politics have their roots in the past, particularly in anti-Irish and anti-Mediterranean racism and in the (semi-)colonial position of the PIGS in the British and Ottoman empires. Besides structural violence against the periphery, a major consequence of this racialization is that it jeopardizes any possibility of further democratic political integration on the basis of a common European identity.

T1  - Traveling Words: A Reflection on "Rotundamente negra" and Afro-Descendant Women's Cultural Politics: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1880680328
AB  - This paper is both a personal reflection and critical analysis of the circulation of the poem "Rotundamente negra" by Afro-Costa Rican poet and cultural activist Shirley Campbell among Afro-descendant women in Latin America. As I heard various recitations and interpretations of the poem at several meetings of Afro-descendant social movements across the Americas, I was also bearing witness to the process by which creative cultural expressions become politicized and popularized by their audiences, especially Afro-descendant women, to reflect a collective desire, goal, and identity. When the poem was first published in 1994, its circulation was limited among literary circles in Costa Rica and the local Afro-Costa Rican women's movement. Now a quick search on Google reveals hundreds of "hits" on social media sites and electronic magazines, revealing not only the impact of technology, but also of the physical transnational flows of Afro-descendant women and their ideas at conferences, meeting one another, and finding common ground through political activism and poetry. Most significant is the meaning women attach to the poem and the places where it is interpreted, recited, or posted. The circulation and the appeal of the poem signals that Black women in various parts of the Americas are collectively using it not only as a tool of self-expression, but also as a point of departure for consciousness-raising, identity formation, and collective action. In a region where Black women live doubly-invisible lives amongst the most marginalized of the hemisphere, the poem is both a self-affirmation and a battle cry. The poem relates to the "everyday" of Black women's lives and reveals itself to be a seemingly "innocent" but influential tool of empowerment. Black women recognize themselves in the verses and they "recognize the array of forces controlling their lives" (Bobo igg5, 6). "Rotundamente negra" politicizes as it circulates through the Americas with its message of racial identification and pride that defies the homogenizing tendencies of mestizaje and blanqueamiento. The poem has become an affirming instrument to support, but also a meaningful platform for Black women's organizations, activists, and individuals.

T1  - Life Satisfaction, Self-Esteem, and Loneliness Among LGB Adults and Heterosexual Adults in China
AN  - 1746631208
AB  - Low levels of life satisfaction have been linked to low self-esteem and loneliness, but this association has never been tested directly in LGB (lesbian/gay/bisexual) populations. We compared 275 Chinese LGB adults to 275 demographic-matched Chinese heterosexual controls on life satisfaction, self-esteem, and loneliness. LGB adults reported lower levels of self-esteem and higher levels of loneliness than heterosexuals, but similar levels of overall life satisfaction. Self-esteem partially mediated (but did not moderate) the relationship between loneliness and life satisfaction in both groups. Hierarchical regressions indicated that demographic variables, loneliness, and self-esteem can predict life satisfaction in both LGB and heterosexual adults, but explained more variance of life satisfaction in the LGB group. Thus self-esteem and loneliness play a more important role in life satisfaction for LGB rather than heterosexual Chinese adults.

T1  - Turning the race-class dialectic on its head: the case of an AFL union
AN  - 1722193250
AB  - Using his research into the American Federation of Musicians, the author shows how those trained in jazz and classical music responded negatively to the emergence of jump blues and rock-and-roll music in the late 1940s. Interracial solidarity within the union was made possible in part by the creation of a particular class distinction based on taste, formed through musical training and performance. Though it has been customary for followers of W. E. B. Du Bois such as David Roediger, who describes the 'dialectic of race and class', to emphasise the critical factor of race in US class formation, this article suggests the need for a more nuanced position. In his study, the author shows how class solidarity can be made possible through racial distinction, while in other cases interracial solidarity is constructed around class distinction. To expand our analyses of how class mediates racial formations means examining cultural, discursive and ideological dimensions of class as well as the structural aspects.

T1  - CONTESTED TERRAIN
AN  - 1700674223; 201525154
AB  - Since 1969, the procurement powers of government have been used proactively to assist minority-owned businesses. Originating in the U.S. Small Business Administration, the practice of targeting procurement contracts to minority-owned business enterprises (MBEs) has expanded throughout government and corporate America. Compared to other minorities, Black-owned firms have been the most active participants. Preferential procurement has been controversial for decades, and its effectiveness for assisting bona fide MBEs has been repeatedly questioned. 'Front-company' abuses have received abundant media attention; allegations of reverse discrimination have inspired legal challenges; the judiciary has often thrown out procurement preferences targeted to minorities. Less attention has focused on understanding whether racially targeted procurement preferences have assisted minority-owned businesses. As the multi-billion dollar government and corporate procurement market opened up, employment in Black-owned firms operating in the impacted industries soared. Growing access to procurement opportunities encouraged firm creation and expansion. Government entities operating successful programs actively screened out front firms, eased bonding requirements, downsized and unbundled contracts, and paid MBE vendor invoices promptly. In the process, they effectively lowered key barriers limiting MBE participation in mainstream procurement markets. Well-designed and administered programs succeeded because they created a less discriminatory environment, thus allowing talented entrepreneurs to build large firms. Problems notwithstanding, preferential procurement programs have been highly successful, and this success is a reflection of declining barriers unleashing the creativity of new generations of Black entrepreneurs.

T1  - 'Fraudulent' Identities: The Politics of Defining Quilombo Descendants in Brazil
AN  - 1718069560; 201530698
AB  - This article analyzes the role of historians and anthropologists in the conceptualization of 'quilombo,' past and present, in Brazil. The validity of the new political identity, remanescente de quilombo (quilombo descendant), has been contested by the popular media as a 'fraudulent' identity used by black communities to obtain land rights. While the term quilombo was used by the Portuguese Crown to refer to three or more fugitive slaves in hiding, quilombo descendants have been defined beyond the limits of simply the ancestors of fugitive slaves. I argue that when it comes to quilombo descendants obtaining actual rights they are often dismissed as frauds until proven authentic. Their authenticity depends not only on their ability to perform and describe the ancestral history of their community, but more importantly, in their ability to tell a specific history of their past as it has been written and incorporated into the Brazilian national imaginary.

T1  - Double Standards and Speech Deficits: What is Sayable for British Muslims After Paris?
AN  - 1786265024
AB  - The recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Copenhagen have re-ignited debates about freedom of speech across Europe. The Paris attacks took place on 7th January 2015 when two brothers, Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, broke into the offices of the French satirical weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo armed with assault rifles. They killed 11 people who worked for the newspaper and injured 11 others in the building, going on to shoot dead a French National Police officer outside the building. The two brothers identified themselves as belonging to Al Qaeda in the Yemen. Further related attacks were undertaken by an associate of the brothers, Amedy Coulibaly, who first killed a municipal police officer and then took the lives of four hostages in a Jewish supermarket. A video was subsequently posted online in which Coulibaly pledged his allegiance to ISIS. The Copenhagen attacks took place on February 15th and were conducted by Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein who had attempted to enter an event on 'Art, Blasphemy and Freedom of Expression' carrying firearms. It is thought that his primary intention was to assassinate Lars Vilks, the cartoonist responsible for the pictures of the Prophet Mohammed reproduced in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in 2005. El-Hussein was intercepted as he tried to enter the building by the film director Finn Nørgaard who he shot dead. He fled, later killing a security guard standing outside a Jewish synagogue in the city. In the context of the incidents above, the cartoon depictions of the Prophet Mohammed - reproduced in the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and previously in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten - have acted as a flashpoint for violence and a touchstone for debate. In this paper we wish to contribute to this debate, focussing on the issue of the limits of freedom of speech for British Muslims. Through three qualitative studies conducted in the North-West of England over the last decade (see Mythen, Walklate and Khan 2009; Mythen, Walklate and Khan 2013; Khan 2015), we have been able to gather valuable insights into the outlooks of young British Pakistani Muslims, listening to their frustrations, aspirations and fears. Applying the grounded theory method and deploying focus groups and semi-structured interviews, we have accumulated data that enables us to reflect on important issues that affect the lives of young Muslims. While, these studies have primarily been focussed on issues cognate to contemporary debates about freedom of expression, here we wish to draw across the studies in order to highlight two key problems which have been frequently raised by participants and which are highly pertinent to public debates post the Charlie Hebdo attacks: standards around freedom of expression and speech deficits. As an ensemble, our studies indicate that these two issues have caused frustration and resentment, whilst also exacerbating feelings of marginalisation. Allying these issues to the current climate of anxiety regarding terrorism post Paris, we posit that the stretchiness associated with freedom of speech - both legally and at the level of political and media discourse - presents serious problems for Muslims in particular and impacts their capacity to voice firmly held opinions.

T1  - EX-YUGOSLAVIAN IMMIGRANT WORKERS IN SLOVENIA: BETWEEN BALKANIZATION AND VICTIMIZATION
AN  - 1761679542; 201602254
AB  - This article explores how the identity of immigrant workers (mostly ex-Yugoslavians) in Slovenia is constructed in the Slovenian print media. The article focuses on the interplay of the two main discourses on immigrant workers - Balkanist discourse and victimization discourse. The analysis shows how Balkanist discourse still constructs the immigrant as the other but avoids explicitly negative connotations by framing immigrant workers' identity within a discourse of victimization. The article explains how this interplay of discourses serves to normalize the immigrant worker in order to make him acceptable to the majoritarian Slovenian society. The article closes by exploring the victimization discourse as a process of desubjectivizing of the immigrant workers and argues that aspects of the victimization discourse reaffirm the long-standing power relations between Western Europe and the Balkans.

T1  - The Construction of Migrant Work and Workers by Alberta Legislators, 2000-2011
AN  - 1761675795; 201602186
AB  - This paper uses narrative analysis to explore how Alberta government Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) 'constructed' migrant work and migrant workers in legislature and media statements between 2000 and 2011. Government MLAs asserted that migrant work (1) was economically necessary and (2) posed no threat to Canadian workers. Government MLAs also asserted that international migrant workers (3) had questionable occupational, linguistic or cultural skills and (4) caused negative social and economic impacts in Canada. Taken individually, these narratives appear contradictory, casting migrant work as good but migrant workers as bad. Viewed together, these narratives comprise an effort to dehumanize temporary and permanent international migrant workers. This (sometimes racialized) 'othering' of migrant workers justifies migrant workers' partial citizenship and suppresses criticism of their poor treatment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Between Irony and Belief: The Queer Diasporic Underground Aesthetics of José Rodríguez-Soltero and Mario Montez: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1755543997
AB  - In the 1960s, camp's ironic register expanded to many of the decade's cultural and artistic discourses, becoming hegemonic in historical accounts. This essay examines the response of two queer diasporic Puerto Rican artists, the filmmaker Jose Rodriguez-Soltero and the drag performer "superstar" Mario Montez, who were members of New York's artistic underground, to such an expansion. While Puerto Rican and Latino migrants to the city were associated in the works of underground artists with a seamlessly unfractured culture of fervor and belief that often made their cultural practices illegible as "art," queer diasporic Puerto Rican artists, who were the product of multiple colonial and metropolitan displacements, promoted an aesthetics of mediation that combined calculation with surrender, and self-conscious dismantling of cinematic and artistic conventions with exaltation and belief. The essay further examines the recent comeback of Montez in contemporary queer debates on camp, failure, and shame in light of this diasporic aesthetics.

AN  - 1680151017; 201513950
AB  - This paper examines the role that social context plays in mediating racial socialization in upper-middle-class white families. Outcomes of white racial socialization, as well as the process itself, depend in large part on the distinctive racial contexts designed by parents in which white children live and interact. I examine variation in white middle-school-aged children's common-sense racial knowledge and discuss the importance of exploring the social reproduction and reworking of racial ideologies and privilege in childhood.

T1  - Undocumented Immigrant Threat and Support for Social Controls
AN  - 1777916748
AB  - Popular support for enhanced border and internal controls to deal with undocumented immigration is examined in relation to contextual measures of group threat as well as perceived levels of cultural and economic threat posed by undocumented immigrants. Results from a national survey of non-Latino respondents (N = 1,364) indicate that presumed threatening context measured in static terms is inconsequential. But when context is measured in dynamic terms that also reflect dispersion and potential contact, it significantly predicts support for border controls. Perceived threats are stronger predictors of support for enhanced controls than either contextual indicators of presumed threat or individual characteristics of respondents. Results also show that perceived economic and cultural threats mediate the effects of individual respondent characteristics and dynamic contextual conditions as well. Implications for future research on immigrant threat emphasize the importance of context measured in both change and dispersion-related terms and responses to threat that distinguish alternative dimensions of control. Future work should also consider that perceptions of threat may not only have direct influence on immigration policy preferences but can mediate the effects of context and individual characteristics on those preferences.

T1  - Denying humanness to victims: How gang members justify violent behavior
AN  - 1700674249; 201524879
AB  - The high prevalence of violent offending amongst gang-involved youth has been established in the literature. Yet the underlying psychological mechanisms that enable youth to engage in such acts of violence remain unclear. One hundred eighty-nine young people were recruited from areas in London, UK, known for their gang activity. We found that gang members, in comparison to nongang youth, described the groups they belong to as having recognized leaders, specific rules and codes, initiation rituals, and special clothing. Gang members were also more likely than nongang youth to engage in violent behavior and endorse moral disengagement strategies (i.e., moral justification, euphemistic language, advantageous comparison, displacement of responsibility, attribution of blame, and dehumanization). Finally, we found that dehumanizing victims partially mediated the relationship between gang membership and violent behavior. These findings highlight the effects of groups at the individual level and an underlying psychological mechanism that explains, in part, how gang members engage in violence.

T1  - Ethnic Print Media in Australia: Il Globo in the 1980s
AN  - 1660022379; 201505669
AB  - This paper investigates the content of the editorial commentary in the Melbourne-based commercial Italian-language newspaper Il Globo from 1979 to 1989 and argues that throughout the period under examination it consistently maintained a proactive role for, and on behalf of, the Italo-Australian community. A longitudinal study on selected editorials written by then editor-in-chief Nino Randazzo shows that the newspaper lobbied relevant authorities and Australian governments alike on issues that mattered most to the Italian community, especially those related to domestic politics, migrant settlement and immigration. Using a content analysis methodology, the editorials were categorised into commonly emerging themes, highlighting the extent to which the newspaper commented on issues that affected the rapidly changing Italo-Australian community which experienced an important demographic shift from being predominantly Italian-born to increasingly Australian-born.

T1  - The new politics of pastoralism: Identity, justice and global activism
AN  - 1551000084; 201429129
AB  - Concerns with the politics and practices of resource rights and access are integral to contemporary debates over environmental justice. Struggles over identity politics, especially the strategic articulation and deployment of particular identities at diverse geographical scales, have recently emerged as important mediators of justice claims in respect of resources rights, but also of recognition and procedural justice. To date, critical, multi-scalar analyses of identity-based claims for environmental justice have focused largely on the indigenous peoples' movement. In doing so, they have failed to embrace an emergent dimension of identity-based, trans-scalar justice, namely the fledgling global pastoralists' movement, the empirical focus for this paper. In the early years of the 21st century mobile pastoralists have begun to carve out new global spaces, through which diverse groups have attempted to negotiate common ground and forge common identities in their struggles for justice. In particular, mobile pastoralists have become increasingly visible in conservation politics and contests over land rights as they lay claim to both discursive and material ground as 'custodians of the commons' in an era of global climatic change. This paper draws on empirical work amongst pastoralists, NGOs and activists from Kenya, Mongolia and Spain to explore these identities, their implications for resource rights and access and the multi-scalar chains of accountability and legitimacy between global activists and their local constituents.

T1  - Influential factors on ethnocentrism: The effect of socioeconomic status, anomie, and authoritarianism
AN  - 1660024809; 201505654
AB  - This study examines the relation of dimensions of ethnocentrism with socio-structural factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), feelings of anomie, and authoritarianism. Using clustered sampling, 500 students were selected from ten high schools in Ahvaz, Iran. Results of structural equation modeling showed that SES has a direct positive effect on ethnocentrism and an indirect effect through anomie and authoritarianism. Similarly, anomie mediates the effect of SES on authoritarianism. Anomie was found to have an indirect effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism via authoritarianism. Findings confirmed the proposed conceptual path model, which is consistent with findings from other countries. The influence of feelings of anomie in the model is highlighted since it has a very important effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism.

T1  - To help or not to help an outgroup member: The role of the target's individual attributes in resolving potential helpers' motivational conflict
AN  - 1559006845; 201431880
AB  - When people are faced with the decision of whether or not to help an outgroup member, they often experience conflicting motivational tendencies due to the concurrent presence of factors prompting help and factors prompting non-help. We argue that one way of how people deal with this conflict is by taking a closer look at the target's individual attributes, especially at those indicating the target's benevolence. Findings of Experiment 1 (N = 96), in which we manipulated intercultural dissimilarity between participants and a (fictitious) recipient of help and normative pressure to help as two factors affecting motivational conflict, support this basic assumption. Specifically, response latencies analyses confirmed that participants assigned a culturally highly dissimilar target spent more time on inspecting target-related information when normative pressure, and thus motivational conflict, was high than when it was low. Experiment 2 (N = 141) extended these findings by demonstrating that providing potential helpers with explicit information about an outgroup member's benevolence increased helping intentions through reducing their negative interaction expectancies (and thus motivational conflict). As expected, this mediational relationship could only be observed for participants assigned a culturally highly dissimilar target. Experiment 3 (N = 46) replicated these mediation findings in a within-subjects design. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Pornography Consumption and Opposition to Affirmative Action for Women: A Prospective Study
AN  - 1551001371; 201429151
AB  - Despite the persistence of wage gaps and other indicators of discrimination, many Americans oppose affirmative action for women. Our study investigated a potential source of social influence that has often been hypothesized to reduce compassion and sympathy for women: pornography. National panel data were employed. Data were gathered in 2006, 2008, and 2010 from 190 adults ranging in age from 19 to 88 at baseline. Pornography viewing was indexed via reported consumption of pornographic movies. Attitudes toward affirmative action were indexed via opposition to hiring and promotion practices that favor women. Contrary to a selective-exposure perspective on media use, prior opposition to affirmative action did not predict subsequent pornography viewing. Consistent with a social learning perspective on media effects, prior pornography viewing predicted subsequent opposition to affirmative action even after controlling for prior affirmative action attitudes and a number of other potential confounds. Gender did not moderate this association. Practically, these results suggest that pornography may be a social influence that undermines support for affirmative action programs for women. Theoretically, these results align with the perspective that sexual media activate abstract scripts for social behavior which may be applied to judgments that extend beyond the specific interaction patterns depicted.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Against People With Schizophrenia
AN  - 1559006950; 201431897
AB  - There is a growing awareness that responses to mental health disorders differ according to the label. Still, research on contact and prejudice against people with mental health disorders has generally focused on the broader label, 'mental illness,' as though various disorders were interchangeable. The present research specifically investigated the relationship between intergroup contact and avoidance of people with schizophrenia-a particularly stigmatized and challenging group-as well as mediators of that relationship. In Study 1, 78 students completed measures of their prior contact with and prejudice against people with schizophrenia. Prior contact predicted less desired avoidance of people with schizophrenia, and this relationship was mediated by more favorable attitudes. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated the results of Study 1, and also found that less fear and less intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between contact and avoidance. This suggests that contact may effectively reduce prejudice, even against this highly stigmatized group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The Great Australian Loneliness': On Writing an Inter-Asian Biography of Ernestine Hill
AN  - 1551001139; 201429061
AB  - The Great Australian Loneliness (1937) is a famous book of travel reportage by Ernestine Hill (1899-1972), a key figure in the mid-twentieth century shaping of popular media culture in Australia. Through her journalism she disseminated debate about the great public issues of her day: the status of Aboriginal peoples, immigration from Asia and the state's role in national development. In this paper, I take the White Australian 'loneliness' her title invokes as a methodological challenge to situate both her life and the ethnically diverse sociability she actually described in an inter-Asian framework of analysis capable of unsettling those bonds between ethnicity and nationality that many twentieth-century writers worked so hard to secure. In the process, I argue for an 'Australian Asian' approach to cultural history. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Calling forth disability in the classroom
AN  - 1551001113; 201428967
AB  - Disability theory discusses the interplay between impairment and disability as though they can be identified separately. More recently, scholars in the field have sought to move beyond the dichotomy to an interactional model. This article uses evidence from a longitudinal ethnographic case study to demonstrate how notions of interaction and relation need to be understood within context. Socio-cultural theory makes explicit a situated understanding of participation and experience and demonstrates how classroom environments 'call forth' disability. Findings reveal how classrooms as educational contexts mediate the experience of a student with a learning impairment. The evidence shows how a classroom draws on the wider regimes of competence at the institutional level to create particular experiences for students. The challenge for teachers and other support staff in schools is to reflect on and influence the dynamic of impairment/disability within their classroom and school context in order to support appropriate participation and learning.

T1  - Disaster and Discrimination: The Ethnic Chinese Minority in Padang in the Aftermath of the September 2009 Earthquake
AN  - 1622295001; 201438344
AB  - Debates over the issue of discrimination against ethnic Chinese in Padang, West Sumatra, in the aftermath of the September 2009 earthquake centre on the reality of such discrimination. On the one hand, many ethnic Chinese in the city acknowledge that they felt discriminated against. This feeling arose from the very slow and limited response to their own and their family's needs during the emergency situation and recovery process. On the other hand, the pribumi residents and the authorities insist that there was no discrimination. They argue that ethnic Chinese are guilty of exaggeration. In-depth interviews undertaken during June-September and a survey of the news media suggest a need to consider the social complexities surrounding disaster management and recovery.

T1  - On not airing our dirty laundry: Intergroup contexts suppress ingroup criticism among strongly identified group members
AN  - 1541997989; 201426815
AB  - Not every situation affords the appropriate setting to articulate group problems, and I predicted that strongly identified members would be particularly sensitive to the intergroup context in which ingroup criticism is expressed. In Study 1, strongly but not weakly identified members reduced criticism of their ingroup when communicating with an outgroup (vs. ingroup) audience, and this effect was mediated by concerns for the reputation of the group. In Study 2, heightening the salience of intergroup competition suppressed criticism among group members high (but not low) in the solidarity component of identification, even though they were communicating with an ingroup audience. These findings show that even when criticizing their group, strongly identified members are attuned to the collective interest: they are more willing to articulate problems to an insider than when asked to do so by an outgroup member or when reminded of a competitive intergroup dynamic.

T1  - Defining immigrant newcomers in new destinations: symbolic boundaries in Williamsburg, Virginia
AN  - 1520325686; 201413491
AB  - This article examines media representations of immigration in Williamsburg, Virginia, a 'new immigrant destination' in the USA. Through a content analysis of coverage in Williamsburg's local newspaper, we explore how reporters, columnists and readers draw on nationally and internationally circulating discourses to produce public interpretations of immigration issues and construct symbolic boundaries between and among in-groups and 'others' in the community. 'National boundaries drawn locally' captures how media actors use nationally recognizable frames to interpret local issues and define the parameters of community and national belonging. 'Localized symbolic boundaries' take their meanings from place-based, cultural understandings, specific economic conditions and demographics in the local setting. Newspaper discussions in Williamsburg distinguish between 'deserving' foreign student workers (primarily from Eastern Europe and Asia) and 'undeserving', racialized, Latino 'others'. Our analysis advances theories of boundary construction and holds implications for the politics of belonging more generally in other immigrant-receiving contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mediators of stereotype threat among black college students
AN  - 1520325675; 201413289
AB  - We hypothesize that the manner in which stereotype threat affects college-grade achievement is mediated by institutional context as well as individual characteristics. Drawing on a sample of black students from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, we find weak and inconsistent evidence that institutional characteristics influence the operation of stereotype threat. We find more consistent evidence to indicate that the effect of stereotype threat is conditioned by individual factors such as skin colour, multiracial origins and an integrated upbringing. Most of the effect on grade achievement occurs through the internalization pathway, in which the internalization of negative stereotypes leads to disinvestment manifested by a reduction in academic effort. The reduction in work effort, in turn, lowers grades. We also find evidence that immigrant origin confers protection from the negative effects of stereotype threat through both internalization and externalization mechanisms, although the ultimate effect of grade achievement is rather small.

T1  - Warlpiri and the Pacific -- Ideas for an Intercultural History of the Warlpiri
AN  - 1494751536; 201401998
AB  - Bob Tonkinson's dual ethnographic interest in Aboriginal Australia and the Pacific led him to a realisation of the relative poverty of historical anthropology of Aboriginal Australia compared to the efflorescence of work on cultural transformation in the Pacific exemplified by the Kastom debate. In some of his later work on the Mardu he attempted to correct this by reporting developments among the Mardu as they occurred. This paper will borrow some of the mid-level theorising about cultural transformation in the Pacific to suggest a revision of the colonial history of another Australian desert group: the Warlpiri. One way to do this is to extract from the Kastom debate the more general theme of the transformation of self-objectifications of cultural practice over colonial history and the importance of identity development in relation to the colonisers. It will focus on a comparison of the self-objectifications of two generations of intermediary figures. Key figures in the first generation embraced work and, unlike the Mardu at Jigalong, Christianity, but as part of a relatively thorough-going separation of Aboriginal and Whitefella domains. The later intermediary figures, through their unusually high level of education, added skills in a variety of new self-objectifying discourses as 'traditional owners', practitioners of 'two-way' educational and media projects and as bearers of Indigenous rights.

AB  - Chaz Bono's appearance on Dancing with the Stars (DWTS) marks one of the first primetime, network appearances of a postoperative transgender person. This article deconstructs the mediated gender subjectivities of Bono as constructed by the show itself via prerecorded segments, costume and song choices, dance partner interaction, and judges' commentaries as well as those projected by Bono during the live, unscripted portions of the show. Combining notions of the normalization of taboo sexual subjectivities through mediated contexts with lens of gender performativity, we demonstrate how transgender subjectivities are presented to a mainstream audience via such mediated choices, but also how Bono welds some agency to resist such normalization through his live performances. Bono's appearance on DWTS stands as an important step toward acceptance of transgendered persons in mainstream society, however through a neutered, sex-free rhetoric as projected by the mediated portions of the show, his appearance is not without controversy. Additionally, we posit that Bono represents a transnormativity of a White, upper-class postoperative heterosexual male, which others all transgendered persons who fall outside of those hegemonic parallels of safe subjectivities.

T1  - The Relationships Between Sense of Belonging to the Gay Community, Body Image Dissatisfaction, and Self-Esteem Among Australian Gay Men
AN  - 1567044234; 201435151
AB  - Body image dissatisfaction has been linked to belonging to the gay community and poor self-esteem among gay men. This study was designed to explore the applicability of a moderation model and a mediation model in explaining the relations between sense of belonging to the gay community, body image dissatisfaction and self-esteem among 90 self-identified Australian gay men. Participants completed the psychological subscale of the Sense of Belonging Instrument, the Body Satisfaction Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results supported the moderation model; the relation between body image dissatisfaction and self-esteem was found to be statistically significant only at average and high levels of belonging to the gay community. The mediation model was also supported; body image dissatisfaction partially mediated the sense of belonging-self-esteem relation. Educating gay men and health professionals about the possible negative outcomes of 'belonging' to an appearance-oriented community is important. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From Coverage to Action: The Immigration Debate and Its Effects on Participation
AN  - 1373429507; 201328677
AB  - The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of media stories about immigration as a result of increases in authorized and unauthorized immigration to the United States. Scholars know little about how this coverage influences political participation across different groups in society. This study employs an experimental design to test the effects of different media frames on immigration in spurring political participation among recent immigrant-rooted communities and non-immigrant-rooted communities. The authors find strong mobilizing effects among Latinos, particularly for frames that highlight social costs and national security concerns, and weak to no effects on Asians, African Americans, and whites.

T1  - You Must Remember This: Obituaries and the Civil Rights Movement
AN  - 1463008742; 201345835
AB  - This study demonstrates how reporter-written obituaries of Black civil rights movement leaders reinforce a limited, facile view of the African American freedom struggle that haunts even today's race relations. The obituaries remember a movement that Julian Bond characterized as "a morality play" of "Black saints" against "southern White sinners." What these articles remember-and in some cases forget-is critical because collective memory research shows that obituaries reflect what the present thinks of the past. Five nostalgic, racialized frames emerge from these obituaries: (a) the importance of violence inflicted on Blacks, (b) the importance of the dutiful suffering endured by Blacks, (c) news media's documentation of White southern oppression, (d) the salience and valence of the early-1960s Martin Luther King Jr., and (e) the idealism of integration over Black nationalist goals.

T1  - Impact of retirement type on income for people with disabilities
AN  - 1417527308; 201331880
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of involuntary retirement on the economic security of persons with a disability. Very little research examines the economic consequences to forced retirement and no research focuses on persons with disabilities who have a higher rate of involuntary retirement than the general population. Analysing the 2006 Canadian Participation and Activity Limitation Survey, we find that persons with a disability who involuntarily retire have lower median personal and household incomes and they are more likely to be under the low-income cut-off point than those who retire voluntarily. When socio-demographic, socio-economic and geographical characteristics are controlled; those who retired involuntarily are more likely to be under the low-income cut-off point than those whose retirement was voluntary. Further, those who retired involuntarily are more likely to receive disability benefits whereas those who retired voluntarily are more likely to receive retirement income. The authors argue for employers and governments to implement accommodation in the workplace and flexible employment opportunities so that more persons with disabilities are able to continue in their employment for as long as possible.

T1  - Londoners and Outlanders: Polish Labour Migration through the European Lens
AN  - 1417521189; 201332086
AB  - This article covers a series of prominent tropes and shifts that characterize the cinematic portrayal of immigrant workers from Poland in contemporary European film, with a special focus on the on-screen treatment of Polish jobseekers moving to the United Kingdom in the post-accession period. As a comparative and contextual analysis of recent London-set films such as Ken Loach's "It's a Free World" (2007) and Dominic Lees's "Outlanders" (2007) indicates, Polish characters are gradually climbing up the social ladder within Fortress Europe, getting rid of their label of prototypical labour immigrants, whereas the empty space is taken up by immigrants from outside the Schengen zone.

T1  - Inclusive Britishness: A Multiculturalist Advance
AN  - 1322716446; 201310858
AB  - Scholars argue that policies of multiculturalism in different countries are in retreat or in question. Britain is often used as an example of this, and leading British politicians and commentators often criticise such a policy. Yet a long-held multiculturalist goal has been to make Britishness more inclusive and this is something leading politicians were until recently uncommitted to. We use interviews with politicians who have served in this government and the last, the measures they have introduced, their media contributions, speeches and policy documents, to show that they are now committed to this goal. At a time when a British policy of multiculturalism is said to be in retreat or in question we identify a multiculturalist advance and show that this raises a range of difficult questions about government approaches to 'Britishness'.

T1  - Space of Possibilities: Civic Discourse and Multicultural Citizenship in Locally Produced Chinese Television Programs in Metro Vancouver
AN  - 1322723686; 201310783
AB  - This paper uses content analysis and interviews to produce case studies of Fairchild Group's Talentvision (Mandarin) and two local current-affairs talk show programs in Mandarin. Based on the concept of geo-ethnic media and multicultural communication infrastructure model, the paper argues that geo-ethnic media can be a powerful means to promote civic virtues in a large, pluralistic modern society and to help new immigrants transform their "formal" citizenship into a "substantive" citizenship. The geo-ethnic media also provides a transnational supplement to the mainstream public sphere, which allows a sub-national ethnic community to maintain its cultural identity. The paper concludes that further efforts should be made to foster communication and interaction between the mainstream media and the diverse world of ethnic media in Canada.

AN  - 1512220527; 201408793
AB  - This paper examines how race relations have changed since Barack Obama was elected to the office of President of the United States. The authors examined media coverage of issues encountered by this president, to see if any of those issues had a racial bias. Results showed that change has come to America in the area of race relations because a black man has ascended to the Presidency, the highest office in the land. On the other hand, commentators are still debating his 'blackness' or lack thereof, which indicates race remains a salient issue in society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Return of Old-Fashioned Racism to White Americans' Partisan Preferences in the Early Obama Era
AN  - 1322719081; 201310852
AB  - Old-fashioned racism (OFR) was unrelated to white Americans' partisan preferences throughout the post-civil rights era. This study argues OFR could return to white partisanship following decades of dormancy because of Obama's presidency. After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists' partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006, with that relationship once again mediated by President Obama; and experimentally connecting Obama to congressional candidates significantly increased the relationship between OFR and 2010 preferences.

T1  - 'Gaza in Oslo': Social imaginaries in the political engagement of Norwegian minority youth
AN  - 1448996393; 201342853
AB  - In the winter of 2008/09 thousands of people took to the streets of Oslo to demonstrate against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Young people of visible minority and Muslim background were central actors in these demonstrations. The public expression of Muslim identities and symbols during the demonstrations along with clashes between some of the young demonstrators and the police fuelled the already polarized debate concerning the integration of immigrant youth and Islamic radicalism existing in the Norwegian public realm. Using data gathered through ethnographic fieldwork and web-ethnography we follow the engagement of youth from a multi-ethnic Oslo mosque both online and offline. In critical dialogue with perspectives on political contention and transnational political activism, we analyse this transnational mobilization in terms of the 'social imaginaries' that mediated engagement with the Gaza question: 'the global Muslim imaginary', 'secular leftist internationalism' and 'integration nations'.

T1  - Stereotypes of U.S. Immigrants from Four Global Regions
AN  - 1266146620; 201300477
AB  - This study explores variation in stereotypes of U.S. immigrants from Latin America, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. We exploit a split-ballot design in two waves of the Ohio Poll to test hypotheses about effects of contextual and respondent-level characteristics on immigrant stereotypes. Respondents generally rated Asian immigrants most positively and Latin American immigrants most negatively, with European and Middle Eastern immigrants occupying an intermediate position. Findings from regression analyses indicate little direct effect of county-level percent foreign born or media consumption. The strongest effects observed were income on stereotypes of Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants and concerns about the problem of unauthorized immigration on stereotypes of Latin American and Middle Eastern immigrants. Our findings suggest that views about the characteristics of certain groups of immigrants are strongly linked to national-level debates about unauthorized immigration.

T1  - Deconstructing Good Times and The Cosby Show: In Search of My "Authentic" Black Experience
AN  - 1373427882; 201328616
AB  - As countless critics of The Cosby Show (1984-1992) would have us believe, the Huxtable family, as portrayed and envisioned by educator and comedian Bill Cosby, is not the traditional representation of Black family life. For many critics, as well as some Cosby show defenders, the experience depicted by the fictional Huxtable family was the unique experience of too few African Americans at the time; the suggestion is that the family is very wealthy. Contrary to the moral majority, its critics and defenders, I am not from the upper or middle classes like the Huxtable family; however, I identified with The Cosby Show more than with its predecessors, like Good Times (1974-1979). African Americans are no different than any other American group, and therefore, as writer and novelist Wendy Alexia Rountree suggests in her article " 'Faking the Funk': A Journey Towards Authentic Blackness," we "should be allowed to develop individual identities that are not considered in conflict with our ethnic group identity but as a legitimate part of it." Consequently, as someone who identifies with The Cosby Show; who is an autistic, working-class Black female from the projects of East Harlem with two Ivy League degrees; and for whom cowboy boots are her footwear of choice, I say, take Good Times and The Cosby Show if you must, but leave me my Black experience.

T1  - From dhow culture to the diaspora: ZIFF, film, and the framing of transnational imaginaries in the western Indian Ocean
AN  - 1373428520; 201328519
AB  - Coastal East Africa has been dramatically re-imagined in recent years. Popular culture and mass media have played a central role in sparking new visions of how Zanzibar in particular "connects" with the wider world. For more than a decade now, both the Zanzibar International Film Festival (ZIFF) and the Sauti za Busara music festival have worked to resituate Zanzibar regionally and within a wider diasporic and transnational Indian Ocean milieu. Through the staging and promotion of these annual festivals, culture has become a key tool for development, linked to tourism, media networking, and the growth of culture industries. ZIFF and Busara attempt to refigure Zanzibar with regard to space and temporality, emphasising certain visions of history and collective identity that are anything but uncontested. In practice and performance, ZIFF and Busara invoke transnational continuities across the Indian Ocean world; pan-Africanism and continental solidarities; the black diaspora; regional connections; and local cultural roots. This article focuses on the contradictions that unfold from these divergent spatial imaginaries, arguing that images of cultural connection or seamless flows mirror theoretical flaws in transnational studies more broadly.

T1  - Burning red desires: Isan migrants and the politics of desire in contemporary Thailand
AN  - 1266145991; 201300468
AB  - The Red Shirt movement, which reached its peak during May 2010, has been met with puzzlement and ambiguity by media and scholars in and beyond Thailand. Often presented as a one-man-driven movement or a 'peasant revolt', the movement has remained opaque to many observers. This article analyses the ongoing conflict through the eyes of Isan (North Eastern Thai) migrants in Bangkok, especially motorcycle taxi drivers, as motivated by 'politics of desire'. In particular, the article explores how desires for consumption are voiced by a new emerging regional middle class with a diffuse feeling of being stuck between an agricultural past and a self-employed present, due to structural limitations on social and personal development. The author examines the historical emergences and failures of these desires in a complex web of conflicting and overlapping claims to representation, capitalism and class mobility. Positioning desires at the core of the analysis and exploring their configuration and suppression in Thailand through discourses of capitalist access, self-sufficiency and social justice allows severed links to be recovered and apparent contradictions to be reconfigured. This seems necessary to understand the otherwise disconnected and incomprehensible economic, discursive and spatial dimensions of the Thai political conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial Discrimination, Ethnic-Racial Socialization, and Crime: A Micro-sociological Model of Risk and Resilience
AN  - 1266145734; 201300347
AB  - Dominant theoretical explanations of racial disparities in criminal offending overlook a key risk factor associated with race: interpersonal racial discrimination. Building on recent studies that analyze race and crime at the micro-level, we specify a social psychological model linking personal experiences with racial discrimination to an increased risk of offending. We add to this model a consideration of an adaptive facet of African American culture: ethnic-racial socialization, and explore whether two forms-cultural socialization and preparation for bias-provide resilience to the criminogenic effects of interpersonal racial discrimination. Using panel data from several hundred African American male youth from the Family and Community Health Study, we find that racial discrimination is positively associated with increased crime in large part by augmenting depression, hostile views of relationships, and disengagement from conventional norms. Results also indicate that preparation for bias significantly reduces the effects of discrimination on crime, primarily by reducing the effects of these social psychological mediators on offending. Cultural socialization has a less influential but beneficial effect. Finally, we show that the more general parenting context within which preparation for bias takes place influences its protective effects. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Opening the Cabaret America Allegory: Hemispheric Politics, Performance, and Utopia in Flying Down to Rio
AN  - 1417526858; 201333379
AB  - This essay examines the Carioca song-and-dance scene that lies at the narrative center of the 1933 film Flying Down to Rio in light of current theories of identity performance and performativity. Produced by RKO at a time when the studio became the meeting point of U.S. political and industrial interests, Flying represents a seminal moment in the cinematic representation of intercultural relations in the Americas. Its use of music and dance to articulate an inter-American utopia based on spectacle and entertainment ushered in the depiction of Latin American identity as an always evolving performance. Flying established a template for the representation of hemispheric relations that has been followed by numerous films produced not only in Hollywood but also in Latin America. From its position at the onset of the Good Neighbor policy, the scene becomes a historic record of the pivotal role that the construction of Latino and Latin American identities occupies in the articulation of racialist discourses in the United States.

T1  - The Cinematic Incarnation of Frazier's Black Bourgeoisie: Tyler Perry's Black Middle-Class
AN  - 1364700379; 201323426
AB  - Images of Black Americans in modern cinema often depict negative stereotypes of working- and lower-class Blacks. Yet, with the rise of the Black middle-class and the increasing inclusion of Blacks in positions of power within the mass media, more images of middle-class Blacks have begun to appear, particularly through the work of Tyler Perry. We find that Perry's images largely reflect E. Franklin Frazier's characterization of middle-class Blacks in The Black Bourgeoisie (1957), where Perry frames them as (1) materialistic and status-obsessed, (2) dysfunctional and abusive, and (3) disdainful of working- and lower-class Blacks. We also argue that he is creating new controlling images like the "Emasculated Black Gentleman." In these ways, Perry's images may have detrimental consequences including perpetuating Black stereotypes, reinforcing existing class and gender tensions in Black America, and impeding the life chances of middle-class Blacks by suggesting that they are unsuitable for assimilation and integration.

T1  - Attributions for Discriminatory Events and Satisfaction with Social Support in Gay Men
AN  - 1322723218; 201310733
AB  - Attributions modulate the impact of stressful events on mental health. However, little is known about attributions for discriminatory events and their relationship to psychosocial outcomes in sexual minority individuals. Relationships were examined between gay men's attributions for discrimination and their satisfaction with social support, a variable critical to mental health in this population. Gay men (N = 307) completed online measures of satisfaction with social support, attributions for discriminatory events, and key minority stress constructs. Self blaming attributions for discrimination were associated with decreased satisfaction with social support, independent of the frequency with which participants reported experiencing discrimination. The link between self blaming and satisfaction with social support was partially mediated by a latent affective construct comprised of anxiety, depression, and low positive affect. A moderation effect was also found, such that the relationship between frequency of perceived discriminatory events and dissatisfaction with social support was amplified for men reporting more blame toward perpetrators of discrimination. Results support attributions for discrimination as valuable additions to minority stress models. Assessing self and other blame for these discriminatory events may help to clarify pathways by which discrimination can undermine gay men's satisfaction with their social support networks.

T1  - Skin Tone, Racism, Locus of Control, Hostility, and Blood Pressure in Hispanic College Students
AN  - 1023026901; 201223981
AB  - There is some evidence that blood pressure is higher in persons with darker skin tone but the reasons for this remain unclear. When seen in minorities, the positive relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure invites hypotheses about potential mediators of the relationship. We investigated the relationship in Hispanics of primarily Mexican descent and included measures of hostility, locus of control and perceived racial discrimination hypothesized to mediate higher blood pressure. Regression analysis revealed no relationship between darkness of skin and blood pressure but correlations between hypothesized mediators were significant and explicable. Cynical hostility and external locus of control were positively associated with perceived racial discrimination. We reasoned that the chronic experience of racial discrimination reinforces the perception of discrimination and feeds both external locus of control and cynical hostility despite no corresponding unfavorable effect on blood pressure.

T1  - Rethinking Non-Racialism: Reflections of a Selection of South African Leaders
AN  - 1221409575; 201243972
AB  - Drawing from in-depth interviews with 26 prominent South Africans, this article looks at how leaders in government, political parties, business and civil society understand and interpret non-racialism today. It interrogates whether non-racialism is an active political and social project among leaders in South Africa and whether, and how, they are attempting to redefine non-racialism. The article demonstrates that non-racialism is a term still ambiguously understood and defined by South African leaders. Some respondents consider races to be products of social construction and, as such, believe these constructions can be transcended. For many, however, the idea of multiracialism prevails over that of non-racialism. Although non-racialism remains largely a rhetorical ideal among many leaders, respondents did have well-defined views of the challenges facing non-racialism, particularly those of socio-economic inequality and poor leadership from the African National Congress (ANC). Overall, there is a strong sense from many respondents that the values of non-racialism are currently under threat. However, through using social sectors such as education and the media, as well as fostering open debate on non-racialism and facilitating stronger leadership from all areas of society, interviewees did see potential for building a path toward a non-racial South Africa.

T1  - On keeping your enemies close: Powerful leaders seek proximity to ingroup power threats
AN  - 1347785866; 201318505
AB  - Throughout history, humans have had to detect and deflect myriad threats from their social and physical environment in order to survive and flourish. When people detect a threat, the most common response is avoidance. In the present research, the authors provide evidence that ingroup power threats elicit a very different response. Three experiments supported the hypothesis that dominant leaders seek proximity to ingroup members who pose a threat to their power, as a way to control and downregulate the threat that those members pose. In each experiment, leaders high (but not low) in dominance motivation sought proximity to an ingroup member who threatened their power. Consistent with the hypothesis that increased proximity was designed to help leaders protect their own power, the proximity effect was apparent only under conditions of unstable power (not stable power), only in the absence of intergroup competition (not when a rival outgroup was present), and only toward a threatening group member (not a neutral group member). Moreover, the effect was mediated by perceptions of threat (Experiment 1) and the desire to monitor the threatening group member (Experiment 3). These results shed new light on one key strategy through which dominant leaders try to maintain control over valuable yet potentially threatening group members. Findings have implications for theories of power, leadership, and group behavior. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Perceived Racial Discrimination as a Barrier to College Enrollment for African Americans
AN  - 925713868; 201204194
AB  - African Americans trail European Americans in terms of academic achievement, even when accounting for differences in socioeconomic status. One cause of this gap may be racial discrimination. In the current article the authors hypothesized that early perceived racial discrimination (by 5th grade) would predict college enrollment, mediated by changes from 7th grade to 10th grade in academic orientation, college aspirations and expectations, and deviance tolerance. Participants were 750 African Americans from the Family and Community Health Study. A structural equation model that controlled for socioeconomic status and earlier academic performance supported the hypothesis, with the exception that discrimination did not influence aspirations. The effect of discrimination on expectations, however, was moderated: Participants with high future orientation maintained high expectations in spite of discrimination. These results suggest that discrimination discourages some African Americans from pursuing higher education and that increasing future orientation may promote African Americans' college enrollment.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Contact: Concept Explication, Synthesis, and Application
AN  - 1364700660; 201324704
AB  - This article had an overarching goal of paving a foundation for the scholarship on intergroup contact in the field of media research. This goal was approached from three different directions: concept explication, synthesis, and application. First, selective reviews of literature on intergroup contact research and media effects research were conducted to identify a term that can best represent existing terminology on intergroup contact via media consumption and elaborate on its definition. A synthesis of intergroup contact literature and existing studies of mediated intergroup contact revealed potential moderators and mediators of mediated contact effect. Last, current practices of media production and consumption in the United States were analyzed through the lens of intergroup contact to provide an assessment of the current state of mediated contact. Based on these reviews and syntheses, suggestions for future research and practice were made. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Using Critical Race Theory to Analyze How Disney Constructs Diversity: A Construct for the Baccalaureate Human Behavior in the Social Environment Curriculum
AN  - 1283641504; 201303266
AB  - Utilizing the basic tenets of critical race theory, the authors draw upon the expertise of multicultural scholars to raise consciousness and facilitate BSW classroom dialogue about microaggressions perpetrated in Disney animations. Microaggressions pervade our media partly because they typically operate outside the threshold of the dominant culture's conscious awareness. Our main consciousness-raising method is to expose social work students to microaggressions depicted in Disney animations and then use the classroom as a counterspace to process the experience. We note that utilizing critical race theory to become conscious of microaggressions within Disney animations is the first step toward eradicating them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Acculturative Stress and School Belonging Among Latino Youth
AN  - 1018352425; 201212878
AB  - Dimensions of acculturative stress and their implications for school belonging and achievement were examined among 199 Latino middle-school students. The proposed model hypothesized that school belonging would mediate the association between acculturative stress dimensions and low school achievement. Eighty percent youth of the sample were immigrants, 73% had Mexican origins, 57% were girls, and the mean age of the participants was 13.6 years. A factor analysis yielded two dimensions of acculturative stress: discrimination stress and immigration-related stress. Immigration-related stress was associated with age of immigration, but discrimination stress was not. Findings supported the hypothesis that lack of school belonging may be a mechanism by which discrimination stress, but not immigration-related stress, decreases school performance among Latino youth.

T1  - The Semiotic Hitchhiker's Guide to Creaky Voice: Circulation and Gendered Hardcore in a Chicana/o Gang Persona
AN  - 925714328; 201204179
AB  - This paper aims to build on some of Jane Hill's contributions to the understanding of indexicality and the creation of an intertextual media series (Hill 2005), as well as to elucidate the varying levels of awareness that speakers have of linguistic features in the circulation of a stereotype. I show how creaky voice, a type of nonmodal phonation, becomes enregistered within an early narrative context, and is then catapulted by centrifugal media forces, taken as part of a constellation of features that cluster around the persona of "hardcore Chicano gangster." The data presented come from four separate but intricately related sources. One is a narrative of a Chicana girl from Northern California, collected in the 1990s when she was involved in gangs. I also analyze a media-based data set that includes songs about cholos by a Chicano hip hop artist, web-based text and video tutorials on how to act like a cholo, and a representation of a Chicano gangster in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. I explain a mechanism through which a metapragmatically less-than-salient feature can become a semiotic hitchhiker, co-occurring with more overtly ideologized and stereotyped phenomena such as codeswitching and the usage of specific discourse markers.

T1  - From "Ideological Enemies" to "Strategic Partners": A Rhetorical Analysis of U.S.-China Relations in Intercultural Contexts
AN  - 1283640959; 201304324
AB  - By using the theoretical frameworks of rhetorical traditions of both cultures, and realism and post-realism on foreign policy rhetoric, this article examines the dynamics of U.S.-China relations from 1940 to 1990s in historical, political, ideological, and economic contexts as facilitated by media and the discourse of national leaders. It explores the rhetorical construction of U.S.-China relations evolving from "military allies" to "ideological enemies," and from "moral adversaries" to "strategic partners" in responding to international environment and domestic needs. The author contends that rhetoric on U.S.-China relations is largely shaped by the cultural orientations and national interest of each country. This is particular evident in the interplay of moralistic and pragmatic rhetorical orientation in seeking mutual economic benefits and global cooperation. The article offers implications on international communication from the points of how powerful nations can achieve intercultural understanding and peaceful co-existence.

T1  - Proactive Performance: A Context for Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1283640952; 201304269
AB  - Over the years, Allport's (1954) contact hypothesis has become the primary theoretical approach to intergroup contact, yet researchers are just now beginning to explore specific contact contexts. This article introduces proactive performance as a context for intergroup contact. Specifically, interACT, a collegiate performance troupe located at California State University, Long Beach, is used to demonstrate how proactive performance meets the requisite conditions of the contact hypothesis; i.e., promoting social change. Moreover, proactive performance is able to account for several important mediating and moderating variables in intergroup contact. With this in mind, this article is illustrative of praxis, or the intersection between theory and practice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Wealth accumulation among U.S. immigrants: A study of assimilation and differentials
AN  - 919904052; 201201594
AB  - Data from the New Immigrant Survey are used to study wealth differentials among U.S. legal permanent residents. This study is unique in its ability to account for wealth held in the U.S. and that held abroad and yields several key findings. First, relative to immigrants from Western Europe, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand (who have median wealth similar to native born non-Hispanic whites), other immigrant groups have lower levels of total wealth even after accounting for permanent income and life course characteristics. Second, time in the U.S. is positively associated with the wealth of married immigrants, yet this relationship is not statistically significant for single immigrants. Third, differences in the means of measured characteristics between Western European immigrants and those from most other origin regions account for more than 75 percent of observed wealth disparities. However, for immigrants from Asia and from the Indian subcontinent, much of the wealth differential remains unexplained by these factors. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Sharing Moral Values: Anticipated Ingroup Respect as a Determinant of Adherence to Morality-Based (but Not Competence-Based) Group Norms
AN  - 1928267139
AB  - This research examines how moral values regulate the behavior of individual group members. It argues that group members behave in line with moral group norms because they anticipate receiving ingroup respect when enacting moral values that are shared by ingroup members. Data from two experimental studies offer evidence in support. In Study 1 (N = 82), morality-based (but not competence-based) ingroup norms determined whether members of a low-status group opted for individual versus collective strategies for status improvement. This effect was mediated by anticipated ingroup respect and emerged regardless of whether group norms prescribed collectivistic or individualistic behavior. These effects were replicated in Study 2 (N = 69), where no comparable effect was found as a result of moral norms communicated by a higher status outgroup. This indicates that social identity implications rather than interdependence or more generic concerns about social approval or importance of cooperation drive these effects.

T1  - Intergroup anger in intractable conflict: Long-term sentiments predict anger responses during the Gaza War
AN  - 919903926; 201201481
AB  - Anger is one of the most common and destructive emotions in intergroup conflicts, frequently leading to an escalation of intergroup aggression. Prior research has focused on short-term antecedents of intergroup anger, typically using laboratory paradigms. We hypothesized that the long-term sentiment of anger (a broad predisposition that is unrelated to a particular action) would predict subsequent anger responses to provocation. We further hypothesized that this effect would be mediated by appraisals of unfairness of the Palestinians' behavior during the war--one of the core appraisal themes associated with anger. To test this prediction, we used a unique two-wave nationwide representative panel design (n = 501) conducted in Israel during the last war in Gaza. Results showed that the long-term sentiment of anger towards Palestinians (and not general negative affect), measured 13 months prior to the Gaza War, predicted participants' anger responses towards the Palestinians during the war. Furthermore, we found that the effects of long-term anger sentiments were mediated by the participants' current appraisals of unfairness Palestinian behavior.

T1  - The shaping of Islam and Islamophobia in Belgium
AN  - 902079156; 201122343
AB  - The author discusses the way in which Islam has been cast as a political problem in Belgium and how Muslims have, particularly in Flanders, become framed by politicians and commentators in the media as a threat. The actual socioeconomic difficulties that Muslims (particularly those of Turkish and Moroccan descent) face are being redrawn as problems stemming from their culture and religion. State agencies are trying to shape the political organisation that will represent Belgian Muslims, as the issue of Islam is increasingly debated in terms of the 'clash of civilisations', and secularism and the Enlightenment are linked in public debate with a Christian Europe.

T1  - The Prevalence of Sexual Assault Against People Who Identify as Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual in the United States: A Systematic Review
AN  - 914766120; 201200194
AB  - This article systematically reviews 75 studies that examine the prevalence of sexual assault victimization among gay or bisexual (GB) men, and lesbian or bisexual (LB) women, in the United States. All studies were published between 1989 and 2009 and report the results of quantitative research. The authors reviewed the reported prevalence of lifetime sexual assault victimization (LSA), and where available, childhood sexual assault (CSA), adult sexual assault (ASA), intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), and hate crime-related sexual assault (HC). The studies were grouped into those that used a probability or census sampling technique (n = 25) and those that used a non-probability or "community-based" sampling technique (n = 50). A total of 139,635 gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) respondents participated in the underlying studies reviewed. Prevalence estimates of LSA ranged from 15.6-85.0% for LB women and 11.8-54.0% for GB men. Considering the median estimates derived from the collective set of studies reviewed, LB women were more likely to report CSA, ASA, LSA, and IPSA than GB men, whereas GB men were more likely to report HC than LB women. Across all studies, the highest estimates reported were for LSA of LB women (85.0%), CSA of LB women (76.0%), and CSA of GB men (59.2%). With some exceptions, studies using non-probability samples reported higher sexual assault prevalence rates than did population-based or census sample studies. The challenges of assessing sexual assault victimization with GLB populations are discussed, as well as the implications for practice, policy, and future research.

T1  - The Earthquake, the Missionaries, and the Future of Vodou
AN  - 875715888; 201115291
AB  - Although Duvalier used Vodou to legitimize his brutal dictatorship, the religion has traditionally empowered Haitians, particularly people from the poorest segments of the population. Historically, at Bois Caiman, Vodou inspired Haitians to rebel against the French for their freedom, and more recently Vodou priests and priestesses have served as healers, counselors, and mediators between rival families. In a highly patriarchal society, Vodou empowers women by allowing them to bring female issues into the "public eye." Yet in the past three decades Christian missionaries from various Protestant churches have been swarming to Haiti, and unlike the Haitian Catholic church, which tolerates the presence of Vodou in society, they condemn the Afro-Haitian belief system, labeling it a satanic cult The tragic earthquake has created new opportunities for the Christian missionaries. Seeking new recruits, the missionaries blame the devastation on Vodou practitioners, who, at times, question the integrity of their belief. Moreover, the Protestants control a substantial portion of foreign aid, schools, orphanages, and medical centers, which lures Haitians away from their indigenous religion. Although the Protestants provide relief, their constant attack on Vodou reconfigures gender relations, disempowers poor women, and generates sentiment of self-hate among Haitians who are misled into believing that their faith is the source of their plight.

T1  - Stress-Related Growth, Coming Out, and Internalized Homonegativity in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth. An Examination of Stress-Related Growth Within the Minority Stress Model
AN  - 862596248; 201109617
AB  - This study investigates how young lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals deal with coming out and how perceived personal growth may result from that experience. We considered stress-related growth as a mediator between coming-out experiences and internalized homonegativity (IH). Our sample was taken from an online survey and is comprised of 502 LGBs aged 14-30. The social environment's acceptance of an individual's sexual orientation and the individual's social identification influence stress-related growth. Several coming-out indicators influence internalized homonegativity and, although growth perception does not function as a mediator between coming out and internalized homonegativity, it has a direct effect on IH.

T1  - The Impact of Immigrant Concentration in Spanish Schools: School, Class, and Composition Effects
AN  - 1018368573; 201212833
AB  - The existence of a negative correlation between the concentration of immigrants in certain schools and the school attainment of its students is a well-documented empirical conclusion in the American and European sociology of education, yet sociologists of education are still debating why the migrant (and ethnic) composition of schools has such an impact on results above and beyond individual characteristics. Using a Spanish survey study (INECSE, Evaluacion de la Educacion Primaria 2003, Madrid, 2005), this article intends to confirm and measure the poorer results of students in schools where immigrants are more highly represented. It also seeks to identify potential explanations to account for variation in attainment due to the concentration of immigrant origin students in some schools. In the literature, the empirical analyses that seek to explain this empirical regularity are far less frequent, despite the fact that the list of its potential causes includes several mediating mechanisms. We deal with three main groups of causes that could be responsible for this regularity: (i) micro-interactions or peer group effects; (ii) compositional effects-the pupil population is not randomly distributed on the school map but according to important features that determine their future school attainment (such as socio-economic status); and (iii) school/classroom effects-given their contextual characteristics, the quantity and quality of their human and material resources, some schools offer a less stimulating learning environment.

T1  - Pathways Between Acculturation and Health: Does the Measure Matter
AN  - 1010630711; 201210568
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the association between acculturation and functional health using multiple proxies of acculturation to examine explanatory pathways to clarify disparate health findings. A population-based cross-sectional, multistage probability sample from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (N = 3,050) was used. The dependent variables of neuropsychiatric function were depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D]) and cognitive function (mini-mental state examination [MMSE]) examined in separate multivariable regression and structural equation models to examine the pathways between acculturation proxies and neuropsychiatric function. Findings indicated that three acculturation proxies were associated with cognitive function but none were associated with depressive symptoms. English proficiency fully mediated the associations between other acculturation proxies and cognitive function. The findings suggest that language plays a central role in the pathway between acculturation and health among Mexican-origin populations.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 907550495
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnic Dimensions in the Discourse and Identity Strategies of European Converts to Islam in Andalusia and Flanders
AN  - 818800195; 201072197
AB  - This paper provides a comparative analysis of the ethnic dimensions in discourse and identity strategies of European converts to Islam. To highlight the very different conditions which European neo-Muslims face when adopting an ethnicising discourse and/or strategies, two divergent settings for study are selected. We present data on Andalusia (Spain) where, in the aftermath of Francoism, Spanish neo-Muslims revitalised Andalusian ideas about the rootedness of Andalusia in Dar al Islam. This case is compared with Flanders (Belgium). Do we find similar ethnicising strategies and discourses among these two categories of European neo-Muslims? What are the limits of and possibilities for ethnicising conversion in each setting? And what are the implications with regard to the legitimating of the claimed mediatorship of converts between Islamic and European societies, on both an individual and a collective level? We are unable to conclude that the dynamics at the micro level are different in each setting, but are able to show that there are clear strategic differences at the macro and median levels.

T1  - Race, Risk, and Pathology in Psychiatric Culture: Disease Awareness Campaigns as Governmental Rhetoric
AN  - 818800966; 201072672
AB  - In 2006, the National Alliance on Mental Illness and the National Urban League, along with five other organizations, introduced the Depression is Real Campaign, a disease-awareness campaign targeting racial minorities. I trace the ways in which the Depression is Real Campaign frames the expansion of the depression diagnosis and pharmaceutical consumption as shared goals for racial justice advocacy groups and pharmaceutical corporations, focusing on the campaign's attempts to target African Americans. Although the campaign is framed as an antistigma, prorecovery intervention in the name of racial empowerment, it articulates racial and cultural differences as 'risks' in the context of illness that must be eradicated through individual initiatives via the agency of medical science. Highly visible appeals to race are ultimately neutralized in the campaign's affirmation of a mobile neoliberal subjectivity unencumbered by the 'weight' of racial history, structural inequality, or collective identification.

T1  - 'Gay or not?!': Gay men, straight masculinities, and the construction of the Details audience
AN  - 818800153; 201071782
AB  - This article examines representations of gayness in Details since the magazine's transformation from a gay-associated style publication to a men's lifestyle magazine targeting straight men. Whereas queer communication scholars have shown gayness is often used to demarcate differences between gay and straight masculinities to make domestic consumption a 'masculine' practice for straight men, I argue Details also utilized gayness to construct differences between *straight* masculinities. These differences allowed Details to distinguish itself from competitors, using gayness to construct new male audiences around masculinities previously ignored in the men's magazine market and legitimize them as 'authentic' straight identities. This case is significant for the study of consumer masculinities and male-targeted media, asserting the relationship between gay men and straight consumption must be theorized as a dynamic and discursive pattern of gender relations.

T1  - Age Identity in Context
AN  - 764425070; 201064808
AB  - The passage of time is fundamentally experienced through people's interaction with their social worlds. Life-course scholars acknowledge the multiple aspects of time-based experience but have given little attention to age identity in a dynamic context. Drawing from a stress-process model, we expected that turbulence within people's family relations and health declines would produce increases in subjective age. Family role transitions were also examined as potential factors that would hasten subjective aging, but only to the extent that they produced stress. We used the Midlife Development in the United States study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey. Regression results show that turbulence within one's family accelerated age identity and that the effect of diminishing psychosocial resources explained this relationship. For the most part, however, changes within family roles did not affect age identity. On the other hand, the incidence of chronic health problems increased subjective ages, and this relationship too was mediated by the depletion of psychosocial resources. The findings demonstrate an interconnection between the stress process and age identity. Broadening our conception of time-based experience with attention to the stress process offers exciting directions for future theory and research in life course sociology.

T1  - Refining the relationship between ingroup identification and identity management strategies in the sport context: The moderating role of gender and the mediating role of negative mood
AN  - 758124139; 201056718
AB  - The aim of this exploratory research was to refine the relationship between ingroup identification and three classical identity-management strategies: individual mobility, social competition and social creativity. More specifically, in the particular context of sport spectators' reactions to their team loss, we tested the moderating role of gender in differentiating the use of CORFing (distancing) strategy and the mediating role of negative mood in differentiating the use of social competition and social creativity strategies. To this end, 173 French physical education students were asked to watch an edited video clip about a defeat of the French national rugby union team. As expected, and consistent with past research, results first showed that the amount of team identification is a reliable determinant of the participants' choice of an identity management strategy. Highly identified spectators were more associated with engaging themselves in ingroup-protective behaviors (i.e., blasting and boosting) than spectators low in team identification who, in contrast, privileged distancing strategies (i.e., CORFing). Moreover, results revealed that participant's gender moderates the link between ingroup identification and CORFing strategy, and that negative mood mediates the ingroup identification--blasting strategy relationship. Theoretical implications of these moderating and mediating effects are then discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

It looks at the impact of sharper patterns of residential segregation, changes in migration patterns, rising levels of crime & violence, & the increase in the relationships of the urban poor with external actors, such as governments & NGOs. Severe inequality persists, but is mediated by an improvement in living standards, by the range of consumer goods accessible to the poor, & by community- & family-based adaptation.

T1  - African Americans and Physical Health
AN  - 743065759; 201043217
AB  - This research adds to the literature seeking to clarify the social psychological mechanism through which self-esteem is related to physical health for African Americans. Specifically, this study investigates the relationships among self-esteem, happiness, and physical health limitations for a representative sample of African Americans. Utilizing the Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions, these results indicate that the impact of self-esteem on physical health outcomes is mediated by happiness. Interestingly, the positive influence that happiness exerts on physical health is suppressed by age. This study suggests that positive emotions such as happiness are beneficial to outcomes such as physical health by transforming traits such as self-esteem into adaptive capability and personal resources that individuals can use to improve health outcomes.

T1  - Wisdom and Positive Psychosocial Values in Young Adulthood
AN  - 1429639747; 201335864
AB  - The current project investigates wisdom and positive psychosocial characteristics in young adults in a series of three overlapping studies. Study 1 (N = 61) investigated wisdom and ego-integrity, values, and life attitudes. Results indicated that wisdom was positively correlated with ego-integrity and self/other-enhancing values, as well as a sense of personal coherence; wisdom was negatively correlated with hedonistic values. Study 2 (N = 62) investigated wisdom and attachment anxiety/avoidance and life attitudes. Results replicated the findings for the life attitudes of Coherence and Existential Vacuum demonstrated in study 1 and extended these findings by showing predicted correlations among wisdom and four other life attitudes, as well as demonstrated negative correlations among wisdom and attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety. Study 3 (N = 62) showed that wisdom positively predicted attributional complexity, a variable found to reduce social judgement biases. Implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Coming Out Growth: Conceptualizing and Measuring Stress-Related Growth Associated with Coming Out to Others as a Sexual Minority
AN  - 1429637735; 201335857
AB  - Coming out has long been depicted as a process that is conducive to personal growth. However, LGBTQ psychology has yet to conduct systematic, theoretically informed research to study how individuals experience coming out growth (COG) and the impact of such experiences on the lives of sexual minorities. The present investigation seeks to address these gaps in the literature through an examination of stress-related growth within the context of coming out as a sexual minority. Findings from a preliminary investigation of COG in a sample of 418 gay and lesbian adults are presented, including the development and initial validation of the coming out growth scale (COGS), and data addressing the relationship between COG and relevant constructs found in the literature on identity development and stress-related growth. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The movement against illegal immigration: analysis of the central node in the Russian extreme-right movement
AN  - 60352556; 201017716
AB  - ABSTRACT. The goal of this article is to analyse the political communication style of the Movement Against Illegal Immigration (Dvizheniye Protiv Nelegalnoy Immigrazii - DPNI), which is one of the central nodes in the Russian extreme-right movement web network. In the article, the political communication style of the organisation is investigated at two levels - the presentation of online identity and the presentation of offline identity. Online self-presentation is studied by means of the qualitative analysis of the incoming links (position in the web network) and the internal structure of the website. DPNI is conceptualised as a new type of political organisation based on the networking principle allowing flexible membership and based on the interplay of its online and offline self-presentations. The study provides insights into how the new media become embedded in the political communication of extreme-right political organisations in Russia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Bridge Across the Bosphorus: Returned Migrants, their Internet and Media Use and Social Capital
AN  - 60340693; 201012019
AB  - Relatively few studies have focused on migrants who returned to the country of their origin or their parents' origin. Still fewer have examined the communication patterns of call center workers who live in one country but conduct all of their business in the language and culture of another country. Drawing on work by Portes and Bourdieu, this study treats the use of traditional media and the Internet and its relation to the bridging and bonding behavior of a group of Turks who returned to Istanbul from the Netherlands and who are now employed by a Dutch call center company. Based on a survey and three focus groups of employee participants, this research finds that more recent and younger returnees primarily bond with family and friends in Holland through use of Dutch media and Internet use, whereas longer term returnees connect more with Turkish media. Some bridging was occurring through interpersonal communication with Turks by the younger and more recent arrivals. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]
