AB  - Purpose: Product trials are an effective way to influence consumer attitudes. While research has established several factors that influence whether consumers will try a product or not, it is less understood how marketers can optimize the trial experience itself. The purpose of this paper is to explore flow as an optimal state and the factors that give rise to it during a product trail. Design/methodology/approach: This research consists of three experimental studies in which people trial new music. This paper explores the ability of curiosity to optimize consumers’ flow experience during the trial and their attitudes toward the trialed product. This paper manipulates curiosity before the trial using information about the music (Study 1) and music previews (Study 3) and also demonstrates that curiosity is naturally elevated among those high in openness to experience (Study 2). Findings: The results demonstrate that curiosity before a product trial fosters an optimal experience during the trial in the form of flow states, defined as an enjoyable state of full engagement, which in turn mediates more positive attitudes toward the trialed product. This paper demonstrates that curiosity can be evoked using product information or a preview of the content and can vary based on individual differences in openness to experience. The relationship between curiosity and flow is moderated by the valence of the information that is used to elicit curiosity, such that negative-valence information thwarts the relationship. Research limitations/implications: While the studies conducted by the authors focus on the positive influence of curiosity in the trial of music, the effects may be different for other products. These studies are also limited to two different manipulations of curiosity. Practical implications: This research has implications for marketers, as it demonstrates the relevance of flow and how to enable it in product trials to optimize effectiveness. The manipulations also demonstrate how to manage the amount of information that is given to consumers before they trial a product. Originality/value: This research reveals that flow states optimize the product trial experience. This research also advances the understanding of the relationship between curiosity and flow by moderating their relationship with the valence of information that elicits curiosity. The findings also broaden the relevance of curiosity and flow in marketing by demonstrating their benefits within product trials. © 2022, Raymond Lavoie and Kelley Main.

AB  - Background: Pain is a major obstacle and one of the main reasons people seek medical attention and is a frequent stressor for many clients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, clients should not be left complaining, especially when solutions are available; each patient has the right to assess and manage their pain in the best way possible. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAPs) regarding pain management in Palestinian ICU settings and to determine the possible obstacles that may hinder effective and competent pain management for critically ill clients. Methods: This cross-sectional research was conducted online through social media. An approved questionnaire was used to assess KAPs and obstacles in pain treatment approaches for critically ill patients. Bloom’s cutoff points for adequate practice, appropriate knowledge, and a positive attitude were applied. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 was used for analyses. Results: One hundred ninety-one nurses were approached, the majority of the participants in this investigation were males (n = 127, 66.5%), and the mean age of the study participant was 29 ± 7 (year). The overall knowledge score was 15, measured for median knowledge = 7 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 4–8, and higher scores indicate more knowledge about the management and control of pain. The total attitude score = 11, the median = 6, with an IQR of 5–7. The reluctance to prescribe opioids was 79.6%, the lack of proficiency in pain management knowledge was 78.5%, and rigorous controls over opioid use were 77.5%, which was the lion's share of commonly recognized hurdles. The overall practice score was 10, with a median of 5.0 with an IQR of 3.0 to 6.0, and nurses revealed that they would evaluate all the steps involved in pain management in each round they have. Conclusions: This research reveals a knowledge, attitude, and practice gap among the working nurses. Therefore, adequate and efficient plans must be aimed at ICU nurses to foster the level of knowledge and direct attitudes toward pain control through applicable interventional programs. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Formal prehospital emergency medical services cover only a small percent of the population in most low- and middle-income countries. Increasing the involvement of laypersons in prehospital first aid can be an important part of the response to injuries and other medical emergencies. We sought to understand factors associated with the willingness of laypersons in Ghana to provide first aid to road traffic crash victims. Method: This cross-sectional study purposively sampled four crash-prone areas in the Ashanti Region and 385 participants were interviewed. A structured questionnaire was used to ask about their demographic characteristics, first aid knowledge, and perceptions about first aid. Factors affecting willingness to provide first aid were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Most participants were male (57.7%) and young (median age 28 years). A large majority (82.9%) were willing to provide first aid to crash victims. However, only 43.1% had been trained in first aid and only 40.4% had adequate knowledge of first aid (≥ 70% correct). Factors associated with willingness to provide first aid included first aid knowledge (aOR 17.27 for moderate knowledge vs. low knowledge, p=0.018; aOR 13.63 for adequate knowledge vs. low knowledge, p=0.030) and positive attitudes towards first aid, including the feeling that: every person should be trained in first aid (aOR 2.98, p=0.025), first aid increases survival (aOR 2.79, p=0.046), it is important to learn first aid (aOR 2.40, p=0.005), and bystanders have the responsibility to give first aid (aOR 4.34, p<0.001). Conclusion: A high percentage of people in these crash-prone areas of Ashanti Region, Ghana were willing to provide first aid. However, under half had been trained in first aid or had adequate knowledge of first aid. A major implication of these findings is the need to increase the availability of quality training in first aid in these areas. © 2022

AB  - Background: We are currently witnessing an ongoing drug overdose death epidemic in many nations linked to the distribution of illegally manufactured potent synthetic opioids. While many health policy makers and researchers have focused on the root causes and possible solutions to the current crisis, there has been little focus on the power of advocacy and community action by people who use drugs (PWUDs). Specifically, there has been no research on the role of PWUDs in engaging and influencing mass media opinion. Methods: By relying on one of the longest and largest peer-run drug user advocacy groups in the world, the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), newspaper articles, television reports, and magazines that VANDU or its members have been directly involved in will be identified via two data bases (the Canadian Newsstream & Google News). The news articles and videos related to the health of PWUDs and issues affecting PWUDs from 1997 to the end of 2020 will be analyzed qualitatively using Nvivo software. Discussion: As our communities are entering another phase of the drug overdose epidemic, acknowledging and partnering with PWUDs could play an integral part in advancing the goals of harm reduction, treatment, and human rights. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Health risk communication plays a key role in promoting self-protective measures, which are critical in suppressing COVID-19 contagion. Relatively little is known about the communication channels used by rural poor populations to learn novel measures and their effectiveness in promoting self-protective behaviors. Behavioral change can be shaped by people’s trust in government institutions which may be differentiated by social identity, including indigeneity. Methods: During an early phase of the pandemic, we conducted two telephone surveys with over 460 communities – both Indigenous and mestizo – without road access and limited communication access in the Peruvian Amazon. This is the first report on the association of information sources about self-protective measures against COVID-19 with the adoption of self-protective behaviors in remote rural areas in developing countries. Results: People mainly relied on mass media (radio, television, newspapers) and interpersonal sources (local authorities, health workers, neighbors/relatives) for information and adopted handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and social restrictions to varying degrees. Overall, self-protective behaviors were largely positively and negatively associated with mass media and interpersonal sources, respectively, depending on the source-measure combination. Mistrust of the government seems to have shaped how Indigenous and mestizo peoples distinctively responded to interpersonal information sources and relied on mass media. Conclusions: Our findings call for improved media access to better manage pandemics in rural areas, especially among remote Indigenous communities. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Male sex workers who have sex with men (MSW-MSM) are a high-risk group for sexually transmitted infections (STI) including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Provision of sexual services by MSW-MSM has shifted to the internet. Consequently, MSW-MSM have become hidden to care for providers of sexual healthcare services (SHS). The aim of this study was to 1) assess characteristics of the MSW-MSM population and 2) assess MSW-MSM’s perceived barriers and facilitators to utilise SHS provided free and anonymously by the public health STI clinic in The Netherlands. Methods: For this qualitative study, semi-structured individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 MSW-MSM who worked home-based in the Dutch province of Limburg. Participants were recruited from November 2018 to June 2019 by purposive sampling until saturation was reached via 1) five websites and smartphone applications commonly used by MSW-MSM, 2) STI clinic, 3) two gay saunas. A theory-informed interview guide was developed including themes such as sexuality, sex work, SHS and barriers and facilitators to SHS utilisation. The interviews’ recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed by inductive and deductive coding with Atlas.ti 8. Results: The interviewed MSW-MSM were diverse in age (range: 18 – 66; median: 39.5) and mostly western European (85%). Identified barriers to SHS utilisation were lack of self-identification as homosexual and sex worker, perceived stigma on sex work and MSM, the lack of awareness of SHS and a low STI risk perception. Identified facilitators were trust in and positive attitude towards SHS, awareness of SHS’s anonymous, confidential and free-of-charge nature, high STI risk perception and knowledgeable about STI/HIV. MSW-MSM-identified implications for SHS-providers were promotion of SHS on online MSW-MSM and general platforms (e.g. Facebook), offering one-on-one online and informal communication with an SHS-provider (e.g. STI clinic nurse) and providing STI (testing) information. Conclusion: The MSW-MSM population’s diversity and identified barriers, facilitators and implications should be taken into account to optimize accessibility and utilisation of SHS for MSW-MSM in Western Europe. SHS-providers could facilitate sex work disclosure by personally asking patients about sex in exchange for money or goods in a non-judgmental manner and explaining the medical relevance of disclosure. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lingual microcystic lymphatic malformations (LMLMs) are rare congenital vascular malformations presenting as clusters of cysts filled with lymph fluid or blood. Even small well-limited lesions can be responsible for a heavy burden, inducing pain, aesthetic prejudice, or oozing, bleeding, infections. The natural history of LMLMs is progressive worsening punctuated by acute flares. Therapeutic options include surgery, laser excision, and radiofrequency ablation but all are potentially detrimental and expose to local relapse. Therefore, the management frequently relies on a “watchful waiting” approach. In complicated LMLMs, treatment with oral sirolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, is often used. Topical applications of sirolimus on the buccal mucosae have been reported in other oral diseases with good tolerance and none to slight detectable blood sirolimus concentrations. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution applied once daily on LMLM of any stage in children and adults after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 weeks of treatment compared to usual care (no treatment). Methods: This is a randomized, multicentric study using an individually randomized stepped-wedge design over 24 weeks to evaluate topical application of a 1 mg/mL sirolimus solution once daily, on LMLM, versus usual care (no treatment), the control condition. Participants begin with an observational period and later switch to the intervention at a randomized time (week 0, 4, 8, or 12). Visits occur every 4 weeks, either in the study center or by teleconsulting. The primary outcome will be the evaluation of global severity of the LMLM on monthly standardized photographs by 3 independent blinded experts using the physical global assessment (PGA) 0 to 5 scale. Secondary outcomes will include lesion size measurement and quality of life assessment, investigator, and patient-assessed global disease and specific symptoms (oozing, bleeding, sialorrhea, eating impairment, taste modification, aesthetic impairment, pain, and global discomfort) assessment. A biological monitoring will be performed including residual blood sirolimus concentration and usual laboratory parameters. Discussion: Given the disappointing state of current treatment options in LMLMs, topical sirolimus could become firstline therapy in treating LMLMs if its efficacy and safety were to be demonstrated.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of attitude toward leisure and satisfaction with leisure policy on satisfaction with leisure activities and level of happiness in Korean caregivers for young children. Data were collected from 864 participants (397 men and 467 women) using the 2018 National Leisure Activity Survey (NLAS). The results showed that there were no significant differences between male and female caregivers in terms of satisfaction with leisure policy, satisfaction with leisure activities, and level of happiness. Women had more positive attitudes toward leisure. Satisfaction with leisure activities mediated the relationship between attitude toward leisure, satisfaction with leisure policy, and level of happiness; there were no significant differences between men and women with regard to the variables. The study suggests that attitude toward leisure and satisfaction with leisure policy promote the happiness of Korean caregivers for young children. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - One of the important rituals that Muslims do on their pilgrimage to Makkah, which is called Tawaf in Arabic, is a walk around the Ka'aba seven times. The space around the Ka'aba is limited and it is usually crowded. Pilgrims arrive at unpredictable intervals to perform the Tawaf and quickly join the crowd, which increases the population. Congestion and high density are issues that arise during the Tawaf as a result of time and space constraints. Furthermore, short proximity among pilgrims owing to the crowd during prayers, Tawaf, congregation, stay in hotels, creates a perfect environment for transmission of infectious diseases. Therefore, changes in the crowd movement pattern and smart scheduling can not only reduce the transmission of infectious diseases, but safety from being stressed and injuries which is caused due to fellow pilgrims push into each other. This problem specifically affects older people and female pilgrims. This study proposes a smart queue at various entry points to reduce the waiting time in the system as a function of the number of multiple entry/exit loops, social distancing, and arrival rates of pilgrims. The study also proposes to use Internet of Things (IoT), and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technologies to monitor the crowd at exit/entry points that will help in capacity estimation and planning. Furthermore, the study recommends redesigning the entry and exit mechanisms for smart queues to minimize congestion and alleviate the associated problems while maintaining pilgrimage rituals. We evaluated the achievements of our proposed model by simulating historical data. The simulation results indicate that the average completion time for circumambulation is significantly reduced. © 2022 THE AUTHORS

AB  - There has been little research exploring the relationship between personality traits, self-esteem, and stigmatizing attitudes toward those with mental disorders. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which the beholder’s personality influence mental illness stigma have not been tested. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between Big Five personality traits, self-esteem, familiarity, being a healthcare professional, and stigmatization. Moreover, this study aims to explore the mediating effect of perceived dangerousness on the relationship between personality traits and desire for social distance. We conducted a vignette-based representative population survey (N = 2207) in the canton of Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. Multiple regression analyses were employed to examine the associations between personality traits, self-esteem, familiarity, and being a healthcare professional with the desire for social distance and perceived dangerousness. The mediation analyses were performed using the PROCESS macro by Hayes. Analyses showed associations between personality traits and stigmatization towards mental illness. Those who scored higher on openness to experience (β = − 0.13, p < 0.001), (β = − 0.14, p < 0.001), and those who scored higher on agreeableness (β = − 0.15, p < 0.001), (β = − 0.12, p < 0.001) showed a lower desire for social distance and lower perceived dangerousness, respectively. Neuroticism (β = − 0.06, p = 0.012) was inversely associated with perceived dangerousness. Additionally, high self-esteem was associated with increased stigmatization. Personal contact or familiarity with people having mental disorders was associated with decreased stigmatization. Contrarily, healthcare professionals showed higher perceived dangerousness (β = 0.04, p = 0.040). Finally, perceived dangerousness partially mediated the association between openness to experience (indirect effect = − .57, 95% CI [− .71, − 0.43]) as well as agreeableness (indirect effect = − 0.57, 95% CI [− 0.74, − 0.39]) and desire for social distance. Although the explained variance in all analyses is < 10%, the current findings highlight the role of personality traits and self-esteem in areas of stigma. Therefore, future stigma research and anti-stigma campaigns should take individual differences into consideration. Moreover, the current study suggests that perceived dangerousness mediates the relationship between personality traits and desire for social distance. Further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of such relationship. Finally, our results once more underline the necessity of increasing familiarity with mentally ill people and of improving the attitude of healthcare professionals towards persons with mental disorders. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but also affects the mental health of people. Yet, health consequences of the pandemic do not affect all members of society equally. We therefore assessed the mental health burden of individuals who are at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals who are at low risk of severe illness during the first lockdown (March, 2020) in Germany. Furthermore, we investigated variables mediating the effect of being an individual at increased risk of serve illness on depression. Methods: Adult German residents (n = 2.369) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about risk factors for of severe illness from Covid-19 and various aspects of mental health during the first lockdown in Germany. For data collection, standardized and validated self-report measures were used and for data analysis Mann-Whitney U-tests as well as regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results: The results clearly show that the mental health burden is higher among individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals at low risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Moreover, our findings indicate that the association between Covid-19 risk status and depressive symptoms is mediated by concerns about mental health, anxiety and loneliness in a causal effect chain. Conclusions: Individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 have an increased need for psychosocial support during times of lockdown. Future public health policies should pay special attention to these individuals and support them by targeted offers. More research, however, is needed on possible long-term consequences of social distancing on mental health. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental health services into primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care providers (PCPs) may not achieve the expected outcomes for improved service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for training PCPs that reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services. Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation-as-usual training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to train PCPs, entitled Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by mental health specialists. In RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation by people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. The duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes of the study are stigma among PCPs, as measured with the Social Distance Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM implementation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facilities and will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the patients. Stigma will be evaluated as a mediator of reach. Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed. Twenty-four municipalities, the unit of clustering, will be randomized to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with approximately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled for the evaluation of accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. Masking will include PCPs, patients, and psychiatrists. Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. This collaborative approach to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If successful, this implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for mental illness.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most prevalent mental health disorder after childbirth, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, PPD is known to have a long-term influence on the mother and the newborn, and the role of social support network is crucial in early illness recognition. This study aims to evaluate the social support networks’ level of knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding PPD and examine their sociodemographic variables and exposure to the public information relating to PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online Google Form disseminated to people in Klang Valley through WhatsApp, Email, Facebook, Instagram and other available social media among postpartum women’s social support networks aged 18 years and living in the Klang Valley area (N = 394). Data were collected from 1 March to 5 July 2021 and analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test and generalised linear mixed models. Results: During the COVID-19 epidemic in Klang Valley, most participants had good knowledge, negative attitudes and awareness of PPD. Marital status, gender and parity all had significant correlations with the amount of awareness regarding PPD. Ethnicity, gender, parity and educational level showed significant association with attitude towards PPD. No significant relationship was noted between sociodemographic variables and PPD beliefs. Public awareness of PPD was also associated with knowledge and attitude towards it. Conclusions: A significant positive knowledge, negative attitude and negative awareness level of PPD exist among social support networks for postnatal women. However, no significant effect of belief on PPD awareness level was noted. Implications: Insight campaigns and public education about PPD should be conducted to enhance postnatal mothers’ awareness and knowledge. Postnatal care, mental check-ups and counselling sessions for the new mothers are recommended. In future studies, a closer assessment of postpartum social support, variances and similarities across women from diverse racial/ethnic origins is critical. Strengths and limitations: This cross-sectional study is one of the early studies on the area of PPD in the Malaysian region during COVID-19. Numerous data have been collected using low-cost approaches using self-administered surveys through Google Forms in this research. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In Japan, community medicine clerkships facilitate positive attitudes toward rural medical practice and encourage rural recruitment. Rural self-efficacy has been shown to influence rural career intent following a rural clinical placement. However, the impact of subjective difficulties of living in a rural area on future rural career intent is also important. This study aims to explore whether rural self-efficacy influences the relationship between difficulty with living in a rural area and rural career intent. Methods: The subjects included 308 male and 255 female participants aged 20–41 [median (interquartile range): 22 (21–22)] years. Rural self-efficacy was based on a validated scale consisting of 15 questions. Difficulty with living in a rural area was measured asking students. A cohort survey was conducted to evaluate the effect of the rural self-efficacy score on the rural career intent of Japanese medical students after they completed their rural clinical training. Results: The following variables were significantly associated with a higher rural self-efficacy score: female sex (p = 0.003), age < 21 years (p = 0.013), having a doctor as a role model (p < 0.001), gaining admission through a school recommendation (p = 0.016), living in a rural or remote area until the age of 18 years (p = 0.018), and orientation towards general medicine (p < 0.001). In addition, baseline difficulty with living in a rural area was significantly associated with a lower self-efficacy score (p < 0.001). Participants with a stronger intent to practice in a rural area before rural clinical training had higher rural self-efficacy and showed a stronger positive rural career intent after rural clinical training (p < 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that difficulty with living in a rural area [odds ratio (OR): 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39–0.84] was still associated with lower rural career intent after rural clinical training, independent of all confounders such as gender, age, scholarship for regional duty, rural background, and orientation towards general medicine. However, when rural self-efficacy (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07–1.16) was added as a factor for rural career intent, difficulty with living in a rural area (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43–1.06) was no longer observed as an associated factor. Conclusion: Subjective difficulty with living in a rural area was shown to reduce future rural career intent, but high rural self-efficacy ameliorated this decline. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The damage COVID-19 has caused interms of mortalities, economic breakdown and social disruption is immense. The COVID-19 vaccine has been one of the efficient prevention strategies so far in preventing the pandemic. However, the publics’ hesitancy towards vaccines has enormously affected this task. With emerging research findings indicating that a substantial proportion of adults are hesitant about a vaccine for COVID-19, important work that identifies and describes vaccine hesitant individuals is required to begin to understand and address this problem. Objective: This study assessed public attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccine and identified important factors that lead to its hesitancy. Methods: A web and paper-based cross-sectional survey study was conducted from July 31 to August 12, 2021. The study participants are staffs and students at Jimma University. A total of 358 participants were selected using stratified simple random sampling and requested to fill a survey questionnaire. Binomial logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Results: Half of the participants were found to be hesitant to COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of becoming vaccine hesitant among middle income was two times more than those with lower income (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.05–4.5). Furthermore, respondent’s extent of exposure was associated with vaccine hesitancy with the odds of becoming vaccine hesitant among those whose source of COVID-19 information is from four media sources (Social Media, Mass Media, Health care worker and Friends/family/Neighbor) being 74% lower (AOR.26, 95% CI.09–.69) than those with one media source. Concern towards vaccine side effect, vaccine effectiveness and having the belief to treat COVID-19 with traditional remedies were found to increase the odds of becoming vaccine hesitant by 31%, 42% and 37% respectively. Moreover, the association between side-effect concern and vaccine hesitancy was moderated by participant’s religious affiliation. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We analyze President Trump's Twitter posts on the COVID-19 pandemic to quantitatively construct his sentiment proxy to examine its predictive power in industry-level equity returns. With the growing influence of social media, some “special” people have been able to use their celebrity status for wielding significant market influence, thereby causing a new modern crisis. This study parsed words from 2574 tweets from President Trump's Twitter account to explore the predictive power of his sentiments on the US market during the pandemic. After controlling for rigorous factors, result shows that an industry-level negative tone in general content is unlikely to be predictive of stock returns. Furthermore, the consumer goods industry exhibited a negative return when Trump displayed a negative attitude toward the pandemic. Industries adversely affected by the pandemic because of travel restrictions, consumption shocks, and public health issues are statistically correlated with Trump's negative tone on the pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is regarded as the biggest global health crisis in recent decades. The changes in major life domains due to infection control strategies resemble the functional impairment consequential to emotional distress and place many people at greater risk of psychiatric conditions. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing have widely increased the usage of smartphone to receive COVID-19-related information in the past year. However, the excessive use of smartphones has deleterious consequences. The current study investigated general anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-induced anxiety, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSPU) severity. Methods Adults aged 18–75 years were recruited by stratified, probability sampling from a database representative of the population. Among 1080 Hong Kong Chinese (age 18–75 years), a cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted between July 23 and August 25, 2020 (the period of the third wave outbreak of CO-VID-19 in Hong Kong). Participants were assessed with the measures, including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, and Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the associations among general anxiety symptoms, COVID-19-induced anxiety, and severity of PSPU by the Amos 22.0 software. Results Using established cut-off scores, our results found that prevalence of at least moderate anxiety level in around 22% of participants. Using SEM, both general anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-induced anxiety were associated with PSPU severity. Moreover, COVID-19 anxiety partially mediated relations between predisposing general anxiety with PSPU severity. Conclusion This study provides initial data on the mental health status of people affected by COVID-19. It also investigated the relations between COVID-19-induced anxiety and PSPU severity as a coping mechanism. © 2022, Iran University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Social distancing and lockdowns were implemented during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary care physicians needed to adapt quickly to deliver remote care/telemedicine. Methods: A cross-sectional, 47-item online Google Survey was distributed through the Israel Association of Family Physicians (IAFP) mailing list between March 31-May 5, 2020. The questionnaire included demographics, physician characteristics, and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. Sampling weights by sex and age groups were applied. Results: One hundred fifty-nine primary care physicians (10.6% of registered IAFP members; 63.5% women; mean age 53.4 ± 10.4 years and median professional experience 21.3 years) replied to the survey. The majority (59.7%) of the participants performed a mixture of in-person along with phone counseling. About 40% had no former telemedicine experience. The majority indicated that telephone and video formats were inferior to in-person consultation (68%, 57.1% online and phone, respectively). The overall counseling quality grade (on a 1–10 scale,)median (IQR)) was 6.2 (3) for telephone and 7(2) for video. While 66.9% reported experiencing no challenges, 10% had technical problems, 10% interpersonal problems, 5.6% scheduling difficulties, and 7.5% other difficulties. Majority of 56.6% physicians indicated they prescribed more antibiotics,16.4% sent more blood tests, 24.5% referred more to experts, and 49.7% referred more to imaging in comparison to usual counseling. Higher phone quality score was significantly associated with physicians who indicated not prescribing more antibiotics during the pandemic (OR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.134–0.688, p = 0.004). Higher online quality score was associated with physicians who indicated not sending more blood tests during the pandemic (OR = 0.06 95%CI 0.008–0.378, P = 0.003). Conclusions: Our findings suggest telehealth holds considerable promise for counseling in the primary care setting. However, interpersonal challenges raised by physicians should be understood in-depth to develop tailored training and further examine it in randomized trials while integrating patient-reported outcomes. Finally, further research on utility, cost, and cost-efficiency during remote counseling with follow-ups, medical prescribing, and additional referrals is needed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Alleviating suffering and improving quality of life are universally shared goals. In this context, we implemented a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness intervention in the form of meditation involving together cancer patients, health professionals, and third persons. Methods: Two groups of 15 participants equally composed of patients, health professionals and third persons were constituted. A dedicated programme on mindfulness and compassion was constructed, including 12 weekly sessions of 1.5 h and a half-day retreat. Adherence and satisfaction with the programme were evaluated. All participants completed questionnaires on perceived stress, quality of life, mindfulness, empathy, and self-efficacy. Burnout was assessed in health professionals. Results: Shared meditation was feasible as 70% of participants attended ≥ 80% of the 13 meditation sessions. Satisfaction with the programme was high (median satisfaction score: 9.1 out of 10) and all participants expressed positive attitudes towards shared meditation and a benefit on their global quality of life. Participants reported significant improvement in stress (p < 0.001), global quality of life (p = 0.004), self-efficacy (p < 0.001), and mindfulness skills (p < 0.001) from baseline to post-programme. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a shared dedicated meditation programme in terms of participation and acceptability of participants. The measured benefits observed among participants furthermore justify the interest of a subsequent randomized study aiming to demonstrate the potential added value of shared meditation by promoting bridge-building between cancer patients, health professionals and others.

AB  - Background: Public isolated due to the early quarantine regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) increasingly used more social media platforms. Contradictory claims regarding the effect of social media use on mental health needs to be resolved. The purpose of the study was to summarise the association between the time spent on social media platform during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health outcomes (i.e., anxiety and depression). Methods: Studies were screened from the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases. Regarding eligibility criteria, studies conducted after the declaration of the pandemic, studies that measured mental health symptoms with validated tools, and studies that presented quantitative results were eligible. The studies after retrieval evaluated the association between time spent on social media platform and mental health outcomes (i.e. anxiety and depression). The pooled estimates of retrieved studies were summarised in odds ratios (ORs). Data analyses included a random-effect model and an assessment of inter-study heterogeneity. Quality assessment was conducted by two independent researchers using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). This meta-analysis review was registered in PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, registration No CRD42021260223, 15 June 2021). Results: Fourteen studies were included. The increase in the time spent using social media platforms were associated with anxiety symptoms in overall studies (pooled OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.30–1.85), and the heterogeneity between studies was mild (I2 = 26.77%). Similarly, the increase in social media use time was also associated with depressive symptoms (pooled OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.30–1.85), and the heterogeneity between studies was moderate (I2 = 67.16%). For sensitivity analysis, the results of analysis including only the “High quality” studies after quality assessment were similar to those of the overall study with low heterogeneity (anxiety: pooled OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.21–1.96, I2 = 0.00%; depression: pooled OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.69–2.90, I2 = 0.00%). Conclusions: The analysis demonstrated that the excessive time spent on social media platform was associated with a greater likelihood of having symptoms of anxiety and depression. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives: This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods: A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results: 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions: Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social media interactions invariably include trolling, where disruptive or annoying comments are made online, and gender trolling is one aspect of trolling. Gender trolling in India has turned ugly, with mischievous and offensive tweets transforming into threats. However, far too little research has examined the perceptions of such trolling among women. What do Indian women on Twitter feel about trolling? Are they encountering prejudice on the platform as well? How do they cope with vitriolic trolls and online threats? This study employs a feminist narrative approach to evaluate perceptions of gender trolling among women on Twitter in India. The study aims to understand the impact of online trolling among Indian women Twitter influencers. Insights into their online trolling experiences from twenty-five selected women social media influencers on Twitter were gathered through detailed interviews. This study unravelled some critical observations and responses towards gender trolling among women Twitter influencers in India. The research also explored if the regularization of misogynistic laced gender trolling within the Indian online space alters the way women social media influencers respond to trolling. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Positive breastfeeding experiences positively influence subsequent attitudes towards breastfeeding, and increase mothers’ confidence, self-efficacy, motivation and intention to breastfeed. However, the strategies that mothers find useful and effective for creating positive breastfeeding experiences remain largely unknown. The aim of our study was thus to describe experience-based knowledge from mothers about strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences. Methods: The study followed a qualitative design involving the critical incident technique. Data were collected with an online survey containing open-ended questions that was administered to a Sweden-based parenting group on Facebook in September 2018. Ultimately, 340 incidents from 176 women were identified as offering strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences. Data from the written replies were extracted as textual units, condensed and categorised until categories were mutually exclusive, which resulted in six categories. Results: Participating women were on average 31.2 years old and the median number of children per participant was two. Mothers’ strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences generally included being calm and accepting that initiating breastfeeding takes time and can be difficult initially. Participants described feeling close to the baby by maintaining skin-to-skin contact and being present in the moment by taking time to appreciate the child and the breastfeeding situation, and temporarily forgetting about the world and simply being with the child in the here and now. Participants advocated baby-led breastfeeding and following correct techniques. They also described the importance of keeping an effortless mindset about breastfeeding to prevent perceiving breastfeeding as a compulsion. Mothers described acquiring knowledge about breastfeeding so that they could be prepared if breastfeeding problems occurred and getting support from professionals and family was described as significant for having a positive breastfeeding experience. Caring for oneself and one’s body, with aids if necessary, were described as important strategies, as were having a positive attitude and a strong desire to breastfeed. Conclusion: Because positive breastfeeding experiences and support are predictors of future breastfeeding initiation and duration, assisting women in creating positive breastfeeding experiences is important. Asking mothers to formulate strategies that they find useful could facilitate breastfeeding by making their approaches more conscious and visible. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: Advance care planning is a key preparatory step in ensuring high-quality palliative and end of life care, and should be considered as a process, beginning with community-level conversations among lay persons. There is, however, indication that death talk among community-dwelling adults is not occurring, and there is a dearth of research examining why this is the case. This study aims to provide the first examination of barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying among the general population in a UK region (Northern Ireland), and to provide a novel application of health behaviour change theory towards developing a theoretical understanding of the sources of this behaviour. Methods: The study involved qualitative analysis of responses (n = 381 participants) to two open-ended questions within a cross-sectional online survey, with recruitment via social media of adults currently living in Northern Ireland. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on open text responses per question, with the barriers and facilitators mapped on to health behaviour change models (the Behaviour Change Wheel COM-B and the Theoretical Domains Framework). Results: The findings evidence a myriad of barriers and facilitators to engaging in death talk, with themes aligning to areas such as lack of acceptance of death in social contexts and fear of upsetting self or others, and a need to improve interpersonal communication skills for facilitating conversations and improve knowledge of the existing services around death and dying. A theoretical understanding of the drivers of death talk is presented with findings mapped across most components of the COM-B Behaviour Change Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Conclusions: This study contributes to a small but emergent research area examining barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying. Findings from this study can be used to inform new public health programmes towards empowering adults to have these conversations with others in their community towards upstreaming advance care planning. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The persistence of threatened and protected wildlife depends not only on habitat suitability but also remarkably on local communities’ acceptance. The black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) is a flagship species for conservation on the plateau in western China. However, the human dimension has been completely ignored in the decision-making process for conservation. Methods: In this study, a questionnaire survey aiming to assess knowledge of and conservation attitude toward this bird was carried out among 1042 students of 7th and 9th grade from 12 schools in Weining county, Guizhou province, which has a large wintering population in an urban wetland. Logistic regression was used in the generalized linear model to identify the determinants that significantly affect students’ knowledge of and conservation attitude toward this species. Results: Most students have positive attitudes toward conservation, which is significantly affected by awareness, knowledge of this bird and grade. However, they have somewhat limited knowledge of this bird’s biology and ecosystem services (nature’s contributions to people). Knowledge was found to link with observation of the bird and grade, while observation related to the experience of visiting the wetland. Social media is the most cited resource to obtain knowledge on this bird. Conclusion: It is suggested that local conservation experts could help introduce more information on the black-necked crane in the schools and help conduct outdoor education activities in and around the wetland. Traditional knowledge and culture could also be incorporated into the conservation awareness enhancing program. This study focuses on the human dimension for conserving the black-necked crane in China, showing significant implications in the design and application of effective measurements to improve students’ perception and attitude toward its conservation. Future assessments should include other local populations, such as farmers, fishers, and urban citizens. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Some evidence suggests that knowledge and attitudes towards rational antibiotic use influences dispensing practice in community drug retail outlets. However, there is limited evidence in resource limited countries, including Ethiopia. We aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes surrounding antibiotic use or supply and antibiotic resistance, and the non-prescribed antibiotic dispensing practices in community drug retail outlets in non-urban Ethiopia. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of community drug retail outlet staff in the Amhara region, Ethiopia with a focus on non-urban towns. An expert validated self-administered questionnaire was used. Following exploratory factor analysis and best items selection, we summarised our findings and assessed factors associated with non-prescribed antibiotic dispensing. The data were analysed using Stata Statistical Software version 17. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results: A total of 276 participants from 270 drug outlets completed the questionnaire. The participants median age was 30 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 25–35) years and 79.7% were pharmacy assistants. The majority demonstrated good levels of knowledge about antibiotic use or supply and antibiotic resistance (77.9% and 76% of the participants responded correctly to more than half of the items, respectively). We identified four attitude domains: the role of antibiotics in recovering from diseases regardless of their cause (median score = 2 (IQR = 2–4), beliefs inconsistent with good practice); professional competency to supply non-prescribed antibiotics, and the non-prescribed antibiotics supply (median score for each domain = 4 (IQR = 4–5), attitudes consistent with good practice); and positive attitudes towards actions to prevent antibiotic resistance and promote appropriate antibiotic use (median score = 4 (IQR = 4–5). Fifty eight percent of the participants reported that they had dispensed antibiotics without a prescription. Participants who did not perceive that they were competent to supply non-prescribed antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.78–0.93) were less likely to report non-prescribed antibiotics dispensing. Conclusion: While most of the participants had appropriate knowledge about and attitudes to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, basic knowledge and attitude gaps remain. Despite Ethiopia’s regulatory restrictions, the non-prescribed antibiotic provision continues to be a common practice. Our study highlights the need for multifaceted interventions that may include a strict regulatory system, staff training and public education. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 has been available in Germany since December 2020. However, about 30% of the population report not wanting to be vaccinated. In order to increase the willingness of the population to get vaccinated, data on the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors are necessary. Little is known about why individuals refuse the COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons leading to rejecting vaccination, based on posts from three social media sites. Methods: The German-language versions of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were searched regarding negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. We used an interpretive thematic approach to analyze the data and to inductively generate codes, subcategories and categories. Results: Based on 333 posts written by 323 contributing users, we identified six main categories of reasons for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination: Low perceived benefit of vaccination, low perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, health concerns, lack of information, systemic mistrust and spiritual or religious reasons. The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the relevance of providing trustworthy and quality-assured information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination to all population groups. In addition, vaccinations should be easily accessible in order to promote the population’s willingness to be vaccinated. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic where social media platforms relayed information on a large scale, enabling an “infodemic” of conflicting information which undermined the global response to the pandemic. Understanding how the information circulated and evolved on social media platforms is essential for planning future public health campaigns. This study investigated what types of themes about COVID-19 were most viewed on YouTube during the first 8 months of the pandemic, and how COVID-19 themes progressed over this period. Methods: We analyzed top-viewed YouTube COVID-19-related videos in English from December 1, 2019 to August 16, 2020 with an open inductive content analysis. We coded 536 videos associated with 1.1 billion views across the study period. East Asian countries were the first to report the virus, while most of the top-viewed videos in English were from the US. Videos from straight news outlets dominated the top-viewed videos throughout the outbreak, and public health authorities contributed the fewest. Although straight news was the dominant COVID-19 video source with various types of themes, its viewership per video was similar to that for entertainment news and YouTubers after March. Results: We found, first, that collective public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic on YouTube peaked around March 2020, before the outbreak peaked, and flattened afterwards despite a spike in worldwide cases. Second, more videos focused on prevention early on, but videos with political themes increased through time. Third, regarding prevention and control measures, masking received much less attention than lockdown and social distancing in the study period. Conclusion: Our study suggests that a transition of focus from science to politics on social media intensified the COVID-19 infodemic and may have weakened mitigation measures during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that authorities should consider co-operating with reputable social media influencers to promote health campaigns and improve health literacy. In addition, given high levels of globalization of social platforms and polarization of users, tailoring communication towards different digital communities is likely to be essential. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine are available and have a long history in Hong Kong. Little is known on the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong. In this study, the intention to use TCM was examined by the extended theory of planned behavior. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 15 and 29 November 2021. Respondents’ attitude towards using TCM, intention to use TCM, knowledge, perceived behavioral control, perceived service quality, satisfaction, subjective norms and demographic characteristics were collected from the survey. To examine the conceptual framework in this study, partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was adopted. Results: In total, 446 responses (completion rate = 74.3%) were analysed. Attitude towards TCM was the strongest predictor to the intention to use TCM followed by satisfaction and subjective norms. Attitude had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention to use TCM. Attitude had a full mediating effect on the relationship between knowledge and intention to use TCM. Satisfaction had a full mediating effect on the relationship between perceived service quality and intention to use TCM. Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate the predictors of the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong by using TPB. Individuals’ attitude towards TCM has showed stronger effect to the intention to use TCM than other predictors, such as satisfaction, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. To enhance the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong, key stakeholders, including TCM professional organisations, health professionals and policymakers, should develop a positive attitude towards TCM among Hong Kong population. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has impacted the health and social fabric of individuals and families living across the USA, and it has disproportionately affected people living in urban communities with co-morbidities, those working in high-risk settings, refusing or unable to adhere to CDC guidelines, and more. Social determinants of health (SDH), such as stigmatization, incarceration, and poverty, have been associated with increased exposure to COVID-19 and increased deaths. While vaccines and booster shots are available, it will take time to reach herd immunity, and it is unclear how long newly developed vaccines provide protection and how effective they are against emerging variants. Therefore, prevention methods recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control (CDC)—i.e., testing, hand-washing, social distancing, contact tracing, vaccination and booster shots, and quarantine—are essential to reduce the rates of COVID-19 in marginalized communities. This project will adapt and test evidence-based HIV interventions along the prevention and treatment cascade to help address COVID-19 prevention needs. Methods: The study aims to (1) optimize an adaptive intervention that will increase rates of testing and adherence to New Jersey State COVID-19 recommendations (testing, social distancing, quarantine, hospitalization, contact tracing, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots) among high-risk populations and (2) identify predictors of testing completion and adherence to New Jersey recommendations. This study follows Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles to conduct a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) with 670 COVID-19 medically/socially vulnerable people. Participants will be recruited using a variety of strategies including advertisements on social media, posting fliers in public places, street outreach, facility-based, and snowball sampling. Participants complete a baseline survey and are randomized to receive navigation services or an electronic brochure. They then complete a follow-up 7 days after baseline and are randomized again to either continue with their original assignment or switch to the other intervention or critical dialog or brief counseling. Participants then complete a 5-week post-baseline follow-up. Guided by the COVID-19 Continuum of Prevention, Care, and Treatment, the analysis will explore the factors associated with COVID-19 testing within 7 days of the intervention. Discussion: This paper describes the protocol of the first study to use SMART following CBPR to adapt evidence-based HIV prevention interventions to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of an effective and scalable adaptive intervention to increase COVID-19 testing and adherence to public health recommendations, including vaccination and booster shots, among a marginalized and difficult-to-engage population.

AB  - Background: From 2015 to 2018, the Netherlands faced an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by serogroup W. To counter the rise in infections, the government introduced a catch-up menACWY vaccination campaign for teenagers in 2018 and 2019. The outbreak situation induced substantial media attention and a run on menACWY vaccines outside the vaccination campaign. This study aimed to gain insights into the dynamics of public perceptions of and responses to the outbreak and the menACWY vaccination, and into the media coverage about the outbreak. Methods: Three repeated surveys (N = 1110) between 2017 and 2019 were sent to parents of teenagers invited for a menACWY catch-up vaccination, other parents, and individuals with no under-age children. These surveys assessed IMD risk perceptions, attitudes towards the menACWY vaccination, trust in involved institutions, and willingness to vaccinate with the menACWY vaccine. Changes in the public perceptions and responses were studied with linear multilevel regression analyses. In addition, 103 national newspaper articles from the period 2017–2019 were thematically coded with themes about IMD and the menACWY vaccination. Results: The survey results showed clear increases in perceived IMD severity, positive attitude towards the menACWY vaccination, and willingness to vaccinate over time. Perceived IMD vulnerability remained low across all three waves, and trust in involved institutions increased slightly. Differences between the survey groups were limited. The newspaper articles discussed the rise in infections extensively, the disease symptoms, and the possible fatal outcome of IMD. In addition, while many articles discussed the menACWY vaccine shortage, few discussed the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. Conclusion: The real-time insights into the interrelated dynamics of public perceptions, responses, and media coverage provide an integrated portrait of the social developments during this outbreak. The focus on IMD severity and the absence of doubt in the public discussion about vaccine safety may have played an important role in the societal response to this outbreak and the recommended vaccine. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: People with weakened immune systems may not develop adequate protection after taking two doses of the mRNA-combined COVID-19 vaccine. The additional dose may improve the level of protection against Covid-19. Objectives: Current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and determents of third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance among population in the UAE. Methods and materials: This is online descriptive cross-sectional community-based study conducted among the students and faculty of Ajman University from 25 August to 20 October 2021. The questionnaire, which was in the English language, encompassed two sections containing 22 items. Section one gathered the demographic details of the respondents, while Section two used 13 questions to evaluate the respondents’ knowledge of and attitude to the third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. Results: 614 respondents participated in this study. The average knowledge score was 44.6% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [41%, 49%]. Better knowledge scores were observed in postgraduates (OR 4.29; 95% CI 2.28–8.11), employees in the healthcare sector (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.05–2.51), participants who had relatives infected with the Covid-19 (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.05–2.02), participants who had infected with Covid-19 (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.43–3.43) and participants who had received first two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.40–3.11). The average attitude score was 70.2% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [69.2%, 71.2%]. Conclusion: Necessary steps should be taken by the government and public health authorities, in line with the local culture, to increase vaccination acceptance and foster positive attitudes towards the vaccine. A suitable approach to this would be to develop an educational framework that could demonstrate the risks of vaccine avoidance or delay to the general population. Moreover, health authorities should pay more attention to the false information being disseminated across the internet, especially social media. Also, healthcare workers should be trained in vaccinology and virology to make sure that they are able to understand important developments in these fields and convey the findings to their patients. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In response to successive COVID-19 restrictions in Wales, the Welsh ACE Support Hub launched the #TimeToBeKind campaign in March 2021. The campaign used a short film broadcast on national television and promoted on social media to encourage behaviour change for kindness. We evaluated the #TimeToBeKind campaign film to identify whether watching the film would result in increased intention to act in ways that promote kindness to others and if intentions were associated with being emotionally affected by the film. Methods: A mixed methods evaluation was employed, using a short online survey and interaction with the film on the Twitter social media platform. The online survey measured public (n = 390) attitudes towards the film including feelings invoked, and behavioural intentions for acts of kindness as a result of viewing the film. Tweets which interacted with the film (n = 59; likes, re-tweets or comments), and tweet sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards the film were also explored. Results: The majority of participants reported positive attitudes to the film and agreed that they understood the campaign message (91.8%). 67.9% reported that the film made them feel upset or sad and for 22.6% the film resonated with their lockdown experience. As a result of seeing the film, 63.6% reported intentions to be kinder to others, 65.6% intended to try and help other members of their community, and 70.5% were more likely to check in on friends, family and neighbours. A higher proportion of individuals who were emotionally affected by the film (e.g. upset or sad, hopeful or encouraged, gained something positive) and those for whom the film resonated with their lockdown experience reported increased kindness behavioural intentions as a result of seeing the film. Conclusions: Film can be an effective tool to promote behaviour change for kindness. Films that provoke strong emotional reactions can still be perceived positively and lead to behaviour change. With the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating a move online for many, the findings of the present evaluation are relevant to how public health messaging can adapt and utilise this space to target individuals and promote behaviour change. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Parents are the important implementers on appropriate/inappropriate use of antibiotics, especially in the pediatric population. Limited studies have associated poor knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) among parents with antibiotics misuse. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the parents’ KAP and factors associated with inappropriate use of antibiotics among Tanzanian children. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 14 regional referral hospitals (RRHs) in Tanzania between June and September 2020. KAP was estimated using a Likert scale, whereas KAP factors were determined using logistic regression models. A total of 2802 parents were enrolled in the study. The median age (interquartile range) of parents was 30.0 (25–36) years where 82.4% (n = 2305) were female parents. The majority of the parents had primary education, 56.1% (n = 1567). Of 2802 parents, only 10.9% (n = 298) had good knowledge about antibiotics, 16.4% (n = 455) had positive attitude whereas 82.0% (n = 2275) had poor practice on the appropriate use of antibiotics. Parents' education level, i.e., having a university degree (aOR: 3.27 95% CI 1.62–6.63, p = 0.001), good knowledge (aOR: 1.70, 95% CI 1.19–2.23, p = 0.003) and positive attitudes (aOR: 5.56, 95% CI 4.09–7.56, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the appropriate use of antibiotics in children. Most parents had poor knowledge, negative attitude, and poor practice towards antibiotics use in children. Parents’ education level, employment status, knowledge on antibiotic use, and good attitude contributed to the appropriate use of antibiotics in children attending clinics at RRHs. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Effective strategies of prevention have been and can aid in reducing and overcoming contagious diseases including COVID-19, still there is dearth of knowledge regarding general public awareness and perception. The current study aims to determine the existing knowledge and perception of people living in Karachi about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the months of March and April 2020. The study included men and women of age 18 years and above quarantined during COVID-19. Convenience sampling followed by snowball sampling technique was used. An online structured questionnaire was developed using Google Form. It included questions on socio demographic information, public knowledge and perception about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 548 participants were involved in this survey, 34% (n = 184) males with a mean age of 28 ± 10 years ranging from 18 to 75 years. The major source of hearing about COVID-19 was social media (72%, n = 393). Overall knowledge scores revealed that 27% (n = 146) participants had excellent knowledge about symptoms and prevention of the COVID-19. Excellent knowledge of quarantining, isolation and community containment and social distancing was 38% among participants. Participants who had good and excellent knowledge were more likely to have positive perception of isolation (p-value < 0.001). Majority participants (89%, n = 487) felt isolation may or may not be against human rights and this perception was found significantly associated with moderate to excellent knowledge about community mitigation measures (p-value = 0.009). Conclusion: This study concludes that optimal public knowledge and perception related to certain aspects of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment exists however knowledge gaps and misperceptions prevail that need to be addressed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Patient awareness plays an important role in integrating palliative care into the patient care process. Lack of awareness can create a negative attitude towards palliative care and affect patients' decisions during the treatment process. The present study was conducted to determine the level of knowledge about palliative care in Iranian patients with cancer. Methods: The descriptive study was conducted with a convenience sample of 103 cancer patients admitted to an oncology center in Yazd, Iran, A three-part questionnaire including demographic information, sources of palliative care information and the Palliative Care Knowledge Scale (PaCKS) was used to collect data. All statistical analyses were performed using software SPSS 21. Results: The mean age of patients was 36.2 ± 13.5 years. Of the total, 38.8% of patients received information about palliative care through the media and 36.9% from the treatment team. On a scale of 0 to 13, the mean PaCKS score was 6.7 ± 3.7. A ‘good’ level of knowledge was reported by 29.1% of participants; however 84.5% stated that they should leave other doctors at the time of receiving palliative care, 71.8% considered palliative care for patients in the last six months of life, 84.5% considered palliative care for patients with cancer, and 70.9% stated that palliative care encourages people to discontinue treatments aimed at treating their disease. Conclusion: Our study found most cancer patients have a moderate to weak level of knowledge and considerable misinformation about palliative care, which highlights the importance of providing palliative care education. The development of training programs in this area could play an effective role in improving patients' knowledge of palliative care. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Depersonalisation is a common dissociative experience characterised by distressing feelings of being detached or ‘estranged’ from one’s self and body and/or the world. The COVID-19 pandemic forcing millions of people to socially distance themselves from others and to change their lifestyle habits. We have conducted an online study of 622 participants worldwide to investigate the relationship between digital media-based activities, distal social interactions and peoples’ sense of self during the lockdown as contrasted with before the pandemic. We found that increased use of digital media-based activities and online social e-meetings correlated with higher feelings of depersonalisation. We also found that the participants reporting higher experiences of depersonalisation, also reported enhanced vividness of negative emotions (as opposed to positive emotions). Finally, participants who reported that lockdown influenced their life to a greater extent had higher occurrences of depersonalisation experiences. Our findings may help to address key questions regarding well-being during a lockdown, in the general population. Our study points to potential risks related to overly sedentary, and hyper-digitalised lifestyle habits that may induce feelings of living in one’s ‘head’ (mind), disconnected from one’s body, self and the world. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores how South Korean individuals managed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their daily lives during a time of continuous and sustained social distancing using 8241 Instagram posts from May 6 to June 16, 2020. Co-word analysis found two main theme clusters highlighting individuals’ endeavors in daily life management and their fear of COVID-19 infection. DMR topic modeling analysis resulted in five higher-order themes, each reflecting different aspects of people’s COVID-19 experiences. Overall, the results shed light on individuals’ resilience in managing their daily lives despite the fear and discomfort caused by the pandemic. Results also highlight the possibility that the discursive practices of Social Network Services (SNS) reinforce hatred against social minorities and frame otherizing COVID-19 patients as legitimate. The present study suggests the need for a range of social support to help individuals and communities during the prolonged pandemic, including a long-term, large-scale psychological quarantine system. Deliberate social measures also need to be taken to promote the process of social sharing through media texts and SNS to resist hateful frames and othering of social minorities. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are provided. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Bedside teaching (BST) facilitates medical education and has reduced in practice, often due to patient-related concerns. This study aimed to validate a questionnaire exploring patients attitudes towards BST. Methods: International guidelines for questionnaire development were followed. Seven steps were included: literature review, patient interviews, development of clear and understandable items, expert validation, cognitive interviewing and pilot testing. Statistical analyses included exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, investigation of demographic influences and discriminant validity across subscales. Results: Following the literature review, 32 interviews were conducted. Potential items were developed, reviewed and adapted. Experts in medical education and statistics reviewed the draft questionnaire. Fifteen patients consented to cognitive testing and 401 consenting patients completed the final version. The median age of participants was 35 years of age (range: 18 to 70 years). Participants included women attending for antenatal (40%), postnatal (32%) and gynaecology issues (28%). Just under one third (29%) had taken part in medical student teaching previously. Statistical analyses found a two-factor solution, consisting of Educate medical professionals and Conditions for participation subscales with good internal consistency; responses did not vary by age or education. Participants who had opted-in for teaching in the ward and bedside endorsed higher levels of Educate medical professionals, suggesting discriminant validity. A majority of patients (> 92%) reported that they were happy to be involved in BST. Patients believed that they should not be asked to participate in BST should they feel stressed or unwell (68.2%). Conclusion: This study shows extensive patient support for BST, independent of age or education. The desire to educate is a strong motivating factor. This strong support by patients for BST is an area that medical schools and universities can potentially develop. Future versions of this questionnaire may include virtual bedside teaching, in the context of social distancing. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Human embryonic stem cells are currently used for developing treatment against Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the use of ES cells is surrounded with moral concerns. Research regarding the public's attitudes can form an important basis for policymaking. The aim was to explore the perceptions of the public on using donated human embryos for developing treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. Methods: Semi-structured individual qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 members of the general population in Sweden. Interviews were analyzed with thematic content analyses. Results: Four categories and additional sub-categories; Different views on the embryo requires delicacy, Using embryos to treat Parkinson’s disease, Doing things in the right way, and Communication, media, and public opinion. In general, respondents were positive towards the usage of embryotic stem cells to treat PD, but the usage were conditioned and specific terms were demanded. Informed consent from both donors were required and delicacy and sensitivity when working with embryos were needed. Conclusions: It was perceived better to use surplus embryos to treat PD increase is than to discard them, also among those who perceived the embryo as “a potential life.” The participants raised several conditions under usage for treatment should be allowed. Even if the embryos otherwise are going to be discarded, usage requires informed consent from the donating couples. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Physical activity (PA) helps prevention and aftercare of sporadic breast cancer (BC), cardiopulmonary fitness (CPF) being an age-independent predictor of tumor-specific mortality. Therefore, we wanted to identify predictors of CPF (represented by peak oxygen uptake: VO2peak) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers whose risk of developing BC is high. We used cross-sectional data from 68 BRCA1/2 germline mutation carrying women participating in the randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study LIBRE-1. Assessments included cardiopulmonary exercise testing, medical and lifestyle history plus socioeconomic status. Additionally, the participants completed a psychological questionnaire regarding their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control and intention towards PA. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors for participants reaching their age- and sex-adjusted VO2peak reference values. 22 participants (median age: 40 years, interquartile range (IQR) 33–46) were cancer-unaffected and 46 cancer-affected (median age: 44 years, IQR 35–50). The strongest predictor for reaching the reference VO2peak value was attitude towards PA (Odds Ratio 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval 1.3–8.4; p = 0.021). None of the other predictors showed a significant association. A positive attitude towards PA seems to be associated with VO2peak, which should be considered in developing therapeutic and preventive strategies.

AB  - Background: To reduce COVID-19 infection rates during the initial stages of the pandemic, the UK Government mandated a strict period of restriction on freedom of movement or ‘lockdown’. For young people, closure of schools and higher education institutions and social distancing rules may have been particularly challenging, coming at a critical time in their lives for social and emotional development. This study explored young people’s experiences of the UK Government’s initial response to the pandemic and related government messaging. Methods: This qualitative study combines data from research groups at the University of Southampton, University of Edinburgh and University College London. Thirty-six online focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 150 young people (Southampton: n = 69; FGD = 7; Edinburgh: n = 41; FGD = 5; UCL: n = 40; FGD = 24). Thematic analysis was conducted to explore how young people viewed the government’s response and messaging and to develop recommendations for how to best involve young people in addressing similar crises in the future. Results: The abrupt onset of lockdown left young people shocked, confused and feeling ignored by government and media messaging. Despite this, they were motivated to adhere to government advice by the hope that life might soon return to normal. They felt a responsibility to help with the pandemic response, and wanted to be productive with their time, but saw few opportunities to volunteer. Conclusions: Young people want to be listened to and feel they have a part to play in responding to a national crisis such as the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the likelihood of disenfranchising the next generation, Government and the media should focus on developing messaging that reflects young people’s values and concerns and to provide opportunities for young people to become involved in responses to future crises. © 2022, The Author(s).

The Republic of Korea has been providing information to the public through WEAs using mobile phones. This study used five data sets: WEA messages, news articles including the keyword “COVID-19,” the number of confirmed COVID-19 patients, public foot traffic data, and the government’s social distancing level. The WEAs were classified into two topics—“warning” and “guidance”—using a random forest model. The results of the correlation analysis and further detailed analysis confirmed that the “warning” WEA topic and number of news articles significantly affected public foot traffic. However, the “guidance” topic was not significantly associated with public foot traffic. In general, the Korean government’s WEAs were effective at encouraging the public to follow social distance recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the “warning” WEA topic, by providing information about the relative risk directly concerning the recipients, was significantly more effective than the “guidance” topic. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Anatomy education in US medical schools has seen numerous changes since the call for medical education reform in 2010. The purpose of this study was to survey US medical schools to assess recent trends in anatomy education, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anatomy teaching, and future directions of medical school anatomy curricula. Methods: We sent a 29-item survey to anatomy course directors of 145 AAMC-associated allopathic medical schools inquiring about their schools’ anatomy curricula. The survey contained objective discrete questions concerning the curricula changes preceding COVID-19 and those directly related to COVID-19. We also asked subjective and open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 and future directions of anatomy education. Results: A total of 117/143 course directors (82%) completed the survey. Most schools (60%) reported a major change to their anatomy course within the past five years, including a decrease in total course time (20%), integration of anatomy into other courses (19%), and implementation of a “flipped classroom” (15%) teaching style. Due to COVID-19, there was a decrease in the fraction of course time dedicated to “hands-on” learning (p < 0.01) and teaching of clinical correlates (p = 0.02) and radiology (p < 0.01). Most course directors (79%) reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on quality of learning due to decreased interactive or in-person (62%) learning and lack of dissection (44%). Incorporation of virtual-reality applications or 3D anatomy software (23%) and a decrease in cadaver dissection (13%) were the most common future anticipated changes. Conclusion: The constraints conferred by COVID-19 highlight the importance of maximizing interactive learning in the discipline of anatomy. In an era of social distancing and decreased emphasis on conventional anatomy dissection, adaptations of new technologies and teaching modalities may allow for traditional educational rigor to be sustained. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The increasing frequency of extreme weather events across the globe, the intensifying international debates about the political urgency to mitigate climate change, as well as the respective more action demanding social movements have caused a significant increase in climate change awareness among the population. Little research, however, has systematically analyzed the behavioral impact of this development. Using Germany as a case study, we therefore scrutinize whether the recent increase in climate change awareness triggered mainly changes in public perceptions concerning environmental and sustainability issues or whether it has led to sustainable behavioral shifts. Based on previous research, we considered two routes through which an increase in climate change awareness can instigate changes: (a) directly by leading to behavioral changes towards more sustainable consumption decisions, or (b) indirectly by exerting pressure on the political process. Results: The analyzed data in the three consumption sectors of mobility, food consumption and housing confirm the continuing prevalence of an attitude–behavior gap: although there is a broad, strongly positive attitude towards climate protection and increasingly high problem awareness of climate change, so far this attitude does not immediately translate into notable behavioral changes. With regard to effects on political agenda setting, however, the effects are much more immediate. The results confirm strong pressure on the political process mainly through shifts in voter behavior. Conclusions: The results show that the increase in climate change awareness has spurred dynamics in the debate around climate change both among the population and in the political realm. Fueled by the intense media coverage of the Fridays For Future movement and related activities, a snowball effect has been set off, opening a window of opportunity for significant shifts towards more effective and rigorous climate policies. Politicians and decision-makers now have the opportunity to implement sustainability measures with strong support of the population, even if these imply higher costs. Whether there will be further shifts in the current lifestyle towards a more sustainable one, lifestyle changes should be carefully monitored in the coming years, as relevant data are only now becoming available. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Prospective cohort studies are challenging to deliver, with one of the main difficulties lying in retention of participants. The need to socially distance during the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this challenge. The pre-COVID-19 adaptation of the European Quality (EQUAL) study in the UK to a remote form of follow-up for efficiency provides lessons for those who are considering changing their study design. Methods: The EQUAL study is an international prospective cohort study of patients ≥65 years of age with advanced chronic kidney disease. Initially, patients were invited to complete a questionnaire (SF-36, Dialysis Symptom Index and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire) at research clinics every 3–6 months, known as “traditional follow-up” (TFU). In 2018, all living patients were invited to switch to “efficient follow-up” (EFU), which used an abbreviated questionnaire consisting of SF-12 and Dialysis Symptom Index. These were administered centrally by post. Response rates were calculated using returned questionnaires as a proportion of surviving invitees, and error rates presented as the average percentage of unanswered questions or unclear answers, of total questions in returned questionnaires. Response and error rates were calculated 6-monthly in TFU to allow comparisons with EFU. Results: Of the 504 patients initially recruited, 236 were still alive at the time of conversion to EFU; 111 of these (47%) consented to the change in follow-up. In those who consented, median TFU was 34 months, ranging from 0 to 42 months. Their response rates fell steadily from 88% (98/111) at month 0 of TFU, to 20% (3/15) at month 42. The response rate for the first EFU questionnaire was 60% (59/99) of those alive from TFU. With this improvement in response rates, the first EFU also lowered errors to baseline levels seen in early follow-up, after having almost trebled throughout traditional follow-up. Conclusions: Overall, this study demonstrates that administration of shorter follow-up questionnaires by post rather than in person does not negatively impact patient response or error rates. These results may be reassuring for researchers who are trying to limit face-to-face contact with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Social distancing presents a significant obstacle for relationships and threatens mental health. Identifying maladaptive, voluntary coping strategies may inform how to maintain interpersonal relationships and mental health during quarantine. Co-ruminating with peers on negative events, moods and fears has adjustment trade-offs of increasing depression and anxiety risk while also enhancing friendship quality. Similarly, social media use is associated with social benefits and risk to mental health. We extend prior research by examining whether co-ruminating on COVID-19, social media use, and social media use focused on COVID-19 during social isolation was associated with heightened depression and anxiety symptoms but also lower loneliness and higher social support during initial lockdown measures in the USA. Methods: Adults were recruited through social media (n = 345) to complete self-report surveys on co-rumination, social media use, social distancing, social support from March–May 2020. During this cross-sectional assessment, in addition to completing surveys on current depressive symptoms and state and health anxiety, participants also provided retrospective report of their perceived health anxiety levels six months prior. Results: Co-ruminating on COVID-19 with peers and greater time on social media focused on COVID-19 predicted perceived increases in health anxiety and were also associated with higher depressive symptoms and state anxiety, even after controlling for significant demographic predictors. Further, in the context of social distancing, both interaction strategies failed to confer social benefits. Conclusions: Results have direct implications for maintaining psychosocial health during social distancing restrictions. Adults may modify how they engage with peers by limiting COVID-19 content on social media and COVID-19 discussion. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Vaccination against Covid 19 disease was based on rational practice theory. One of the most effective methods to control the COVID-19 pandemic is extensive vaccination coverage in the shortest time. The relevant beliefs and predictors of COVID-19 vaccine and the barriers to and facilitators of receiving COVID-19 vaccine should be identified. Individuals’ intention to receive COVID-19 and the effective factors are of an utmost importance. This study aimed to predict intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine in the South of Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed over a period of 2 months (May 2021 to July 2021) in 4 southern provinces in Iran. The study population of this study included people over 18 years of age who did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The online questionnaire was used to collect data. We recruited participants through a self-selection sampling method and posted the online survey link. The questionnaire had two parts: demographic information and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) questions. All statistical calculations and hypotheses tests were performed using SPSS21 and Amos21 software and the significance level was considered 0.05. Results: A total number of 2556 people participated in this study with a mean age of 37.76 (10.7) of years (Age Range = 18–75). The findings showed that attitudes and subjective norms and the use of social media predict the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. SEM showed that attitude (β = 0.596, P < 0.001), subjective norms (β = 0.265, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. In this study, 78% of people were willing to receive the vaccine when they were officially allowed to. Conclusion: According to the results of the study, it is suggested to strengthen positive attitudes and subjective norms about the importance of COVID-19 vaccination as well as using social media to inform the community in order increase the intention to vaccinate COVID-19 and increase vaccine coverage. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Older adults are at a higher risk from COVID-19. Individual preventive behaviors including frequent hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing play important roles in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. This study aimed to identify the determinants of three preventive behaviors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic by using an Integrated Social Cognition Model. Methods: Using a prospective study design, 516 Chinese older adults from Hubei province of China (mean age = 67.55 years, SD = 6.60, 57.9% females) completed two online questionnaire surveys. The demographics, social cognition constructs (motivational self-efficacy, risk perception, attitude, subjective norm, health knowledge, intention, volitional self-efficacy, planning, action control) and three preventive behaviors were measured during the first-wave online survey from 18 May 2020 to 7 June 2020. One month later, three preventive behaviors were measured again during the second-wave online survey. Data were analyzed by structural equation modelling. Results: Models showed attitude, motivational self-efficacy and subjective norm were consistent predictors of intention, motivational self-efficacy was a consistent predictor of volitional self-efficacy, planning and volitional self-efficacy were consistent predictors of action control, and health knowledge was a consistent predictor of behaviors across all three preventive behaviors. In addition, mediating relationships were found in the model of hand washing behavior. In particular, planning (β =.109, p =.042) and action control (β =.056, p =.047) mediated between volitional self-efficacy and hand washing respectively. Action control also mediated between planning and hand washing (β =.087, p =.044). Moreover, the inclusion of past behaviors in three models attenuated most of the structural relations. Conclusions: The current study’s findings basically supported the Integrated Social Cognition Model and identified key modifiable determinants of preventive behaviors. Based on this model, future interventions aiming to promote COVID-19 preventive behaviors among older adults are warranted. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Increasing access to family planning helps to ensure the reproductive right, decrease unintended pregnancy, improve the health and nutritional status of children, reduction of maternal mortality, and enhance longer birth spacing. However, there is continually low utilization of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods among low and middle-income countries. This study aimed to assess the utilization of long acting and permanent contraceptive methods (LAPMs) and associated factors among women of reproductive age in the West Guji Zone, Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 507 women of reproductive age in the West Guji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia from April 15 to May 15, 2018. Data were collected by a structured, pretested, and interview-based questionnaire with open ended and closed ended questionnaire, then entered, and analyzed by SPSS Version 20. Bivariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out. A 95% confidence interval (CI) AND P-value < 0.05 was considered to declare statistically significant variables. Result: The current utilization of LAPMs at West Guji zone among the reproductive-aged group was found to be 51.1%. More than the median of participants had negative altitude (72.4%) and poor knowledge (57%) towards the LAPMs. Educational status of women, the number of alive children, acceptance of utilization of LAPMs, how treated by other staff, and waiting time during service delivery are significant determinant factors of LAPMs. Conclusion: Overall, more than half of women had a negative attitude and poor knowledge of LAPMs. Educational status of women, the number of alive children, acceptance of utilization of LAPMs, how treated by other staff, and waiting time during service delivery were factors affecting utilization of LAPMs. Therefore, sustained, and appropriate information on LAPMs should be provided to raise knowledge and build the attitude of women and the community. Treating the clients with respect, reducing the waiting time, and collaborative work with health extension worker will enhance utilization of LAPMs. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: From 9th April 2021, everyone in England has been encouraged to take two COVID-19 tests per week. This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods: Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results: We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions: Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: There is research evidence regarding the presence of stigmatising attitudes in psychiatrists towards people with mental illness, but a lack of studies and interventions focused on this issue in low and middle-income countries. Aims: To assess the feasibility of implementing an anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees, and its potential effects. Methods: This study comprised a pre-post design with outcome measures compared between baseline and 3-month follow-up. Quantitative outcome measures were used to evaluate the potential effects of the intervention, whilst the process evaluation required the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Results: Twenty-nine trainees (25% of those invited) participated in the intervention, of whom 18 also participated in the follow-up assessment. Outcome measures showed the intervention had moderately large effects on reducing stereotypes and the influence of other co-workers on trainees’ own attitudes. The main mechanisms of impact identified were recognition of negative attitudes in oneself and colleagues, self-reflection about the impact of stigma, one’s own negative attitudes and recognition of one’s ability to make change. Participants accepted and were satisfied with the intervention, which many considered should be part of their routine training. However, trainees’ work overload and lack of support from the host organisation were identified as barriers to implement the intervention. Conclusions: A brief anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees is feasible, potentially effective, well accepted and was considered necessary by participants. This study also suggests mechanisms of impact and mediators should be considered for developing further interventions, contributing to reducing the damaging effects that mental health-related stigma has on people’s lives. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 serosurveys allow for the monitoring of the level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and support data-driven decisions. We estimated the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a large favela complex in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Methods: A population-based panel study was conducted in Complexo de Manguinhos (16 favelas) with a probabilistic sampling of participants aged ≥1 year who were randomly selected from a census of individuals registered in primary health care clinics that serve the area. Participants answered a structured interview and provided blood samples for serology. Multilevel regression models (with random intercepts to account for participants’ favela of residence) were used to assess factors associated with having anti-S IgG antibodies. Secondary analyses estimated seroprevalence using an additional anti-N IgG assay. Findings: 4,033 participants were included (from Sep/2020 to Feb/2021, 22 epidemic weeks), the median age was 39·8 years (IQR:21·8-57·7), 61% were female, 41% were mixed-race (Pardo) and 23% Black. Overall prevalence was 49·0% (95%CI:46·8%-51·2%) which varied across favelas (from 68·3% to 31·4%). Lower prevalence estimates were found when using the anti-N IgG assay. Odds of having anti-S IgG antibodies were highest for young adults, and those reporting larger household size, poor adherence to social distancing and use of public transportation. Interpretation: We found a significantly higher prevalence of anti-S IgG antibodies than initially anticipated. Disparities in estimates obtained using different serological assays highlight the need for cautious interpretation of serosurveys estimates given the heterogeneity of exposure in communities, loss of immunological biomarkers, serological antigen target, and variant-specific test affinity.

AB  - Despite growing scientific attention for hate, little is known about how perceived threats may influence hate and aggression. In four preregistered online studies (Ntotal = 1422), we test a threat – hate – aggression model, examining the differential effects of symbolic and realistic threats on the emergence of hate, and the associations between hate and specific aggressive behaviors, across interpersonal and intergroup hate targets. In Study 1 we specify models testing the threat – hate – aggression paths. In Studies 2 (interpersonal hate) and 3 and 4 (intergroup hate) we manipulate realistic and symbolic threat perceptions, measuring hate and aggression. Across studies, hate is better predicted by symbolic than realistic threats. Also, hate consistently predicts aggressive tendencies and hurting behaviors, and interpersonal hate mediates the relationship between symbolic threats and the two aggressive behaviors while intergroup hate mediates the relationships between symbolic (and partially realistic) threats and the two aggressive behaviors. We discuss the implications of our findings for hate, threat, and prejudice research. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The role of public spaces in the city has been traditionally linked to their material dimensions. But experience of public spaces has been also increasingly digital in recent decades, with spatialities of urban dwellers being mediated by smart technology. The relation between material and digital dimensions of public space has been changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The social distancing measures severely limited the accessibility and openness of public spaces. Digital technologies can serve as a substitute for the lost possibilities of physical contact. In this study we aim at exploring this possibility and its impacts. We are also interested in using this opportunity to ask questions about the role of space and place, either material, digitally augmented or virtual in the lives of urban dwellers. Our in-depth interviews exposed a situation where it is the lack of access to material public space that is greatly contributing to the creation of social deficits identified in our interview - sensual flattening, otherless world, spatially not-rooted communication, being out of role. These deficits can serve as indicators of the role of the material dimension of public space in social interactions and as a guide to the creation of good quality public spaces. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to tobacco advertising among adolescents increases the likelihood of subsequent tobacco use. It is important to understand the process by which this occurs, in order to appropriately target factors for intervention. The objective of this study was to test whether attitudes towards tobacco advertising mediates the impact of advertising exposure on tobacco use. Methods: From an ongoing prospective cohort study of male adolescents (aged 11–16 at baseline), we recruited a subset of tobacco users and non-users to participate in an additional ecological momentary assessment (EMA) project (N = 164). Adolescents completed smartphone-based surveys 2–3 times/day over a 10-day period with items assessing their exposures and attitudes towards tobacco-related advertising. If participants reported exposure to tobacco advertising, they were asked about their attitudes toward it (how much they enjoyed it, liked it, and found it appealing). Results: Adolescents who reported a greater amount of advertising exposure during the EMA period were more likely to report past-30-day tobacco use at their next cohort follow-up (6–12 months later). Moreover, the impact of advertising exposure on subsequent use was mediated by attitudes toward the tobacco advertisements, as reported during the EMA. This effect remained after controlling for baseline tobacco use. Conclusions: By pairing EMA with long-term follow-up, we identified attitudes as a mediator between adolescent advertising exposure and subsequent tobacco use. Interventions to lessen adolescents’ positive attitudes toward tobacco advertisements may help disrupt this impact. © 2022

AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised in medical imaging systems and processes, and radiographers must embrace this advancement. This study aimed to investigate perceptions, knowledge, and expectations towards integrating AI into medical imaging amongst a sample of radiographers and determine the current state of AI education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information, participants’ perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64% correctly identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer (37%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and deep learning. The majority of participants (83%) agreed they were excited about the advancement of AI, though a level of apprehensiveness remained amongst 29%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with only 8% of participants having received AI teachings in their pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI training within the community. Greater educational programs focusing on AI principles are required to help increase European radiography workforce engagement and involvement in AI technologies. Implications for practice: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of European based radiographers on AI in radiography to help facilitate the embracement of AI technology and convey the need for AI-focused education within the profession. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This study connected framing theory with corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication literature to examine whether a CSR message that emphasizes customers’ contribution to CSR efforts can enhance CSR communication and mitigate the negative effects of skeptical comments from other users on social networking sites (SNSs). Specifically, this study examined whether a customer-credit-sharing CSR message, compared to a conventional self-promoting message, better mitigated the effects of skeptical comments from other SNSs users on values-driven motives perceived by customers, customers’ positive attitudes, and behavioral intentions. It also explored whether the effects of strategic framing changed when skeptical comments were made online by friends or strangers. A total of 400 customers participated in an online between-subjects experiment. The results showed that the credit-sharing message better protected perceived values-driven motives and positive attitudes toward the company after the customers were exposed to skeptical comments, regardless of who posted the skeptical comments. Customers who read the credit-sharing message also showed stronger intention to defend the company's CSR efforts and stronger purchase intention when the skeptical comments came from a friend. More theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Celebrity endorsement has become ubiquitous in international destination marketing, but studies have rarely assessed the differences between the effects of endorsement by a local celebrity vs. a celebrity from tourist source countries (source celebrity). To bridge the literature gap, this paper draws on meaning transfer theory and match-up hypothesis to examine the effectiveness of these two types of celebrity endorsement by exploring the underlying mechanism. By carrying out a pretest and three experiments, the eye-tracking results and lab experiments show that international destination marketing involving a source celebrity (vs. local celebrity) can significantly increase tourists’ visual attention to the advertising destination scenery, positive attitudes toward the destination and intentions to visit. Furthermore, a serial mediation model of celebrity endorsement → celebrity–tourist congruency → tourist attitude toward celebrity → tourist response is also identified. Finally, this paper empirically examines the moderating role of regulatory focus on the celebrity endorsement effect. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic that commenced in 2019 and the resulting prolonged social distancing have converted numerous universities' offline courses to online ones. In South Korea, which is facing a low birth rate and a decrease in school-age population, university students of Generation Z have actioned lawsuits to pursue tuition refunds and have raised the issue of the low quality of university courses through social media. This research establishes research problems of the relationship between student satisfaction with online courses and influencing factors and the relationship between their satisfaction and continual use of the course system. This research obtained a sample of 123 undergraduate students majoring in management. This study implemented questionnaire with the sample and utilized the analysis of generalized structural equation modelling (GSEM). The study found that students' feelings about instructors' useful interaction (feedback) with them and their preference for online courses positively affected their satisfaction with those courses. Satisfaction also exerted a positive effect on their course recommendation to others. The implications of this finding are that instructors and universities need to enhance course quality and the students’ satisfaction level with online courses in a highly competitive where private educational services (e.g., massive open online courses [MOOC], Youtube) are offered and the number of new students is decreasing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This work utilizes data from Twitter to mine association rules and extract knowledge about public attitudes regarding worldwide crises. It exploits the COVID-19 pandemic as a use case, and analyzes tweets gathered between February and August 2020. The proposed methodology comprises topic extraction and visualization techniques, such as WordClouds, to form clusters or themes of opinions. It then uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover frequent wordsets and generate rules that infer to user attitudes. The goal is to utilize ARM as a postprocessing technique to enhance the output of any topic extraction method. Therefore, only strong wordsets are stored after discarding trivia ones. We also employ frequent wordset identification to reduce the number of extracted topics. Our findings showcase that 50 initially retrieved topics are narrowed down to just 4, when combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation with ARM. Our methodology facilitates producing more accurate and generalizable results, whilst exposing implications regarding social media user attitudes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Values associated with neoliberal ideologies are blamed for damaging the social fabric. They may also have deleterious effects on suicidal ideation. Objective: We investigated whether neoliberal values were associated with the risk for suicidal ideation through a set of mediating factors (suicide stigma, help-seeking attitudes, perceived stress, and suicide acceptability). Methods: A total of 508 (249 female) adults from the U.S. responded to a self-administered questionnaire that contained measures of suicidal ideation, neoliberal values, suicide stigma, help-seeking attitudes, perceived stress, and suicide acceptability. We tested a path model that linked neoliberal values to suicidal ideation through multiple mediators. We tested total versus partial mediation models. Results: We found empirical evidence for a full mediation of the association of neoliberal values with perceived stress. Neoliberal values were associated with suicide stigma; suicide stigma was associated with negative attitudes towards help-seeking, which, in turn, were associated with high levels of perceived stress. The association of neoliberal values with suicide acceptability was partially mediated. Perceived stress was positively associated with suicide risk directly and indirectly through suicide acceptability. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that values related to neoliberal ideologies prepare a context that fosters the risk for suicide. For a contextualized understanding of suicidal behavior, more research is needed that explores the role of social, cultural, political, and economic ideologies in the suicidal process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research on the effectiveness of destination logos is sparse. The present study introduces the idea of physimorphic (nature resembling) logos and explores its effectiveness on the tourist vis a vis non-physimorphic or typographic logos. The study hypotheses are developed based on the theories of Cue Utilization, Processing Fluency and Cognitive styles. Three controlled experiments are conducted in sequence with a combined sample size of 514 respondents. Major findings indicate that a physimorphic logo may be more effective than a typographic logo in generating a positive attitude and visit intentions towards a destination, more so for an unfamiliar destination than a familiar one. The results also establish the mediating effect of processing fluency and moderating effect of cognitive styles. The study contributes to the body of tourism literature by introducing and exploring the concept of ‘physimorphism’. The practical implications of the study encourage the use of physimorphic logos for destination branding. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Whether or not consumers participate in beverage packaging recycling is based on their ecological cognition to make the best choice under the comprehensive influence of rationality and perceptuality. After careful research, we shows that: ①ecological cognition has a significant role in promoting the willingness of consumers to participate in the recycling of beverage packaging; ②attitudes toward behavior, subject norms, and perceived behavioral control all have a significant impact on consumers’ willingness to participate in beverage packaging recycling; ③the exemplary norms have greater driving demonstration effects on consumers’ participation in the recycling of beverage packaging than the mandatory norms. Therefore, it is necessary to give full play to the guiding role of the media, increase the publicity of relevant policies such as protecting the ecological environment, and improve the supervision and management system of the urban ecological environment, actively mobilize consumers' willingness to participate in beverage packaging recycling. © 2022

AB  - Objective: To assess the association between lifestyle and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Chinese adults and provide recommendations for increasing vaccination rates. Methods: From August 6, 2021 to August 9, 2021, we recruited 29,925 participants from 31 Chinese provinces via an online questionnaire. We designed a question to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and used 16 items to assess lifestyle by calculating lifestyle scores. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association by using binary logistic regression models. Results: The overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 8.40 % (95 % CI: 8.09–8.72), and the median lifestyle score was 65.00 (interquartile range: 59.00–71.00). After adjusting for potential confounders, the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate decreased significantly with an increase in lifestyle score (P for Trend <0.001). Low COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate was associated with lifestyle factors including adequate sleep, never smoking, intermittent drinking, good relationships, working and studying, using hand sanitizer, wearing masks, less gathering activities, and keeping social distance (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that high lifestyle score is associated with low vaccine hesitancy rate among Chinese. The government should view the smokers (or the drinkers) as the key to further boosting the vaccination rate. In addition, the publicity and education about wearing masks and keeping social distance should be prioritized. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This research explored the impacts of frontline employees' communication styles (task-oriented vs. social-oriented) on consumers' willingness to interact. The hypothesized relationship between communication style and willingness to interact was tested based on two experiments and analyzed by ANOVA and PROCESS program. The results revealed that consumers' willingness to interact was higher when frontline employees adopted a social-oriented style, while social distance mediated this influence. We identified emotional ability similarity as a boundary condition, indicating that social-oriented communication is more effective than task-oriented when there is low emotional ability similarity. However, when the emotional ability similarity is high, both communication styles positively influence consumers' willingness to interact. Theoretical contributions, managerial applications, and future research directions are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the influence of organizational (abusive supervision, organizational support, and interpersonal trust) and community (political interference and perceived crime rate) stressors on police turnover intention via the mediating role of burnout. Methods: A total of 492 police personnel from India participated in the study. Structured Equation Modeling (SEM) was performed for testing hypotheses. Additionally, a machine learning model was built to develop concurrent predictive capability for burnout and turnover intention. Results: While abusive supervision and political interference positively influenced police turnover intention, co-worker trust, perceived organizational support and perceived crime rate negatively contributed to turnover intention. Burnout was found to significantly mediate the relationship between stressors and turnover intention. The machine learning model developed for the study that indicated an accuracy of 85% asserted that about 60% of the sample who suffered from burnout were also prone to developing a positive attitude towards turnover intention. Conclusion: This study is among the first to empirically explore the precursors to police turnover intention in India and establish the role of burnout in the turnover process. Based on the findings, the police organization can introduce and modify policies and practices to help control high employee turnover. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Studies before the outbreak reported that lecturers' and teachers’ expectancy were observable to the students from their classroom behavior and, in turn, affect the students' educational self-efficacy (ES). Our study was conducted to investigate whether the aforementioned finding still holds in the compulsory online learning environment during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online learning was not the only implication of the social distancing policy during the pandemic, any form of social interactions among university students was affected up to the point that they rely more on social media to obtain social feedback that eventually altered the way they evaluate themselves. Because this phenomenon might lead to the way students develop the sense that they matter to their society societal mattering (SM) we hypothesized that SM would be a stronger predictor of ES than the students’ perception of the educators’ expectancy. Nevertheless, the data we collected from 361 purposively recruited students from universities in Indonesia and Malaysia indicated that their perceptions of teachers’ expectancy were no longer a significant predictor of ES when the social mattering was controlled for. Further implications, limitations, and suggestions are discussed. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Translanguaging practice has become increasingly popular in individuals' lives, particularly in online communication among young people. A body of existing research has described translanguaging practice and its potential functions, but few studies have systematically examined individuals' attitudes towards translanguaging practices. Therefore, this paper investigates the extent to which young people consider translanguaging practices appropriate, and how they judge the motivating factors and effects of translanguaging practices on social media. The study chose to focus on self-praise on social media as its research context, aiming to investigate Chinese young people's attitudes toward translanguaging on Weibo and examine whether their gender influences their attitudes. The results showed that Chinese young people generally perceived the use of translanguaging strategies in self-praise on Weibo as appropriate. The participants rated multi-semiotic resources the highest, significantly higher than their ratings of multimodal and multilingual resources. They held a neutral-to-positive attitude towards translanguaging on social media, and the results also revealed consistent gender differences in attitudes towards translanguaging practices in this context. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the context of sharing services, this research examines how ambient scent can improve the perception of the presence of other sharers. Four experiments conducted in real conditions (open-plan workspaces, car-sharing services, rail-stations, and library) show that the diffusion of a clean scent promotes positive attitudes toward sharing space with others. Three alternative explanations are assessed: 1) perceived cleanliness of the space; 2) other users' behaviors; and 3) user's mood. The results indicate that throughout the four experiments, the effect of scents is mediated only by the positive mood induced by the scent. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As one significant indicator of mental wellbeing, satisfaction with life plays important roles in the society and among individuals. Nevertheless, studies have stated that the formation of life satisfaction was different between before and during the pandemic. Among most people, the differences were caused by the implication of social distancing protocols, where people were not fully connected to one another without the help of electronic media; therefore, some of their social roles were altered or became less meaningful. Such changes affected the clarity of how individuals see themselves, as well as the balance of their negative and positive emotional experiences (affect balance). We hypothesized that self-concept clarity predicts life satisfaction through affect balance. We collected our data from 139 Malaysian adults aged between 18 to 60 years through various social media platforms to complete the self-concept clarity scale (SCCS), satisfaction with life scale (SWLS), and scale of positive and negative experience (SPANE). Results of the bootstrap analysis with a 95% confidence interval indicated that the affect balance partially mediated the relationship between self-concept clarity and life satisfaction. © 2022, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - As the effects of climate change begin to materialise across Pacific Island nations, many exposed communities are considering migrating away from their homelands. Migrants’ resettlement experiences can depend upon their reception in the host nation. However, it is unclear whether justice-based obligations will influence host attitudes toward climate migrants. Using an online survey of 238 Aotearoa New Zealanders, we explore how beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, climate justice and global responsibility contribute to public attitudes towards climate migrants. Overall, people thought more positively of immigrants in general than of climate migrants. Through moderated mediation analyses, we observed that people with stronger belief in anthropogenic climate change were more positive towards climate migrants. This pattern was related to people’s beliefs about climate justice and justice-based migration approaches. Findings suggest that host perceptions of climate migrants are connected to being aware of the ties between greenhouse gas emissions and migration. We outline anticipated challenges and potential opportunities for both migrant communities and the nations in which they seek refuge. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives/hypothesis: To determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on Adenotonsillectomies (TA), Tonsil Related Cases (TC), and Peritonsillar Abscess (PTA) Trends. Study design: Retrospective Cohort Study. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System® (PHIS) database, which consists of 51 children's hospitals. Regions were defined according to PHIS rules with at least five children's hospitals per region. We compared monthly total TA, TC, TC as a proportion of all hospital visits, and PTA from all encounters at each hospital from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2021. Results: Compared to 2019, April 2020 saw mean TC drop significantly from 371.62 to 68.37 (p < 0.001). Interestingly, June, September, and December 2020 had significantly higher mean TC compared to 2019. TC as a proportion of all hospital visits decreased significantly throughout the majority of 2021. Similarly, TA significantly decreased during 2020 and 2021 across all regions in the US, starting in March 2020 and this reduction in TA extended through the end of 2021 without any signs of recovery. PTA rates did not change significantly over the three years. Conclusions: The pandemic-plagued 2020 saw a noticeable decrease in overall TC and TA but then rebounded quickly to even higher than pre-pandemic levels. However, this rebound halted for the majority of 2021 and subsequently decreased to lower than pre-pandemic levels, which differs from other communicable pathologies such as otitis media which decreased initially then recovered to pre-pandemic levels by Summer of 2021. © 2022

AB  - This cross-sectional study investigates the implicit and explicit food attitudes of 1,412 Croatian children (5–9 years old) and extends our knowledge regarding how those attitudes relate to food behavior, while accounting for the potential influence of age and environmental variables such as watching television and poverty. While our findings corroborate previous work to show that children's explicit attitudes tend to be more positive toward unhealthy than healthy foods, we also find that implicit attitudes are actually more positive toward healthy than unhealthy foods. Both implicit and explicit attitudes toward healthy foods were more positive at older ages. More positive attitudes were associated with (a) a stronger belief that healthy foods “make me strong” and (b) greater consumption of healthy foods. Watching television was associated with more favorable attitudes toward unhealthy foods. Our study demonstrates how accounting for both implicit and explicit attitudes across different age groups aids understanding of children's food-related beliefs and behaviors. These insights can help health policy makers and parents instill positive attitudes toward healthy food among children early on and increase their consumption of healthy foods during childhood. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Salmon farming has become a controversial topic, with public opposition and conflicts challenging the sustainability of the sector. As a result, a deeper understanding of public perceptions and factors influencing opinions becomes critical for developing sustainable and socially acceptable aquaculture. Based on previous social acceptance literature, this research aimed to investigate the influence of potential motivators on opinion towards salmon aquaculture. In a case study of rural and urban Nova Scotians, 495 people provided their perceptions of salmon aquaculture. Moreover, geographical factors, socio-demographics, and contextual factors were investigated. Geographic differences in factors and attitudes across urban and rural groups suggest an important mediating influence of residence type (urban and rural) on opinion. Ordinal regression analysis found that opinion was primarily influenced by individual characteristics and perceptual variables, i.e., age, environmental value orientation, salmon consumption patterns, perception of risks, and trust in government. Of minor importance were exposure and knowledge of salmon farming. The model indicates respondents who are older, have strong relational values with the ocean, high perception of risks and are distrustful of government are more likely to express negative attitudes towards aquaculture. This study emphasizes the need to recognize that opinion is nuanced, and deeply socially situated, based not only on individual trade-offs between economic benefits and environmental risks, but also on environmental values and relationships and trust regarding how aquaculture is managed. Further, this study highlights the importance of building public trust with decision-makers, along with continued mitigation of risks, in fostering more socially acceptable salmon aquaculture. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, China has witnessed fierce competition for talents among cities. There is evidence that China's first-tier cities are losing their appeal for young talents due to the soaring housing prices and high living costs in first-tier cities, as well as the catch-up of next-tier cities. Therefore, uncovering what factors drive young talents to develop in first-tier cities is important for policymakers to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of first-tier cities. Most previous research on talent migration has focused on demographic and socioeconomic factors, while little research has examined the influence of psychological factors. By adopting the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this paper aims to explore what beliefs and background factors influence university students' intention to develop in first-tier cities after graduation. Using the data we collected from 1242 university students across China, we found that two-thirds of university students have the intention to develop in a first-tier city after graduation. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results show that students' migration intentions were most influenced by their attitudes, followed by subjective norms and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Specifically, beliefs such as realizing future dreams, better job opportunities, and higher wages shape students' positive attitudes towards developing in first-tier cities. The supports from family, friends, teachers, and classmates contribute to positive subjective norms of developing in first-tier cities. In contrast, perceptions of high housing prices, high living costs, and family ties discourage students from developing in first-tier cities. Furthermore, being male, being a non-only child, studying in first-tier cities, and attending higher-ranking universities have positive influences on migration intention through the mediating effects of the TPB constructs. Policy implications were discussed to help first-tier cities attract graduates. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil was widely affected by politics and the population’s consumption of information is fundamental to understanding the situation. This study aimed at understanding the relationship between political-ideological markers, consumption of information, and preventive practices during the pandemic. We conducted an online survey with 1,328 Brazilians who answered a questionnaire about authoritarianism, conservatism, political orientation, trust in social media, and preventive practices during the pandemic The results indicate that right-wing and centrist individuals, with higher authoritarianism or higher conservatism scores, put significantly more trust in the information about Covid-19 conveyed through WhatsApp and less trust in the information conveyed through traditional media, in comparison with left-wing individuals or individuals with low scores for these factors. Additionally, these elements were closely associated with worse practices concerning the use of masks, practices of social distancing, and the intention of being vaccinated. The findings warn of the impacts of fake news in health practices during the pandemic. © 2021, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.

AB  - The current study set out to determine whether youth perceptions of parental and best friends’ likely reactions to their involvement in deviant behavior influenced their own attitude toward deviance (AD) and propensity for future delinquency. It also asked whether the effect was conditional on participant sex. Relationships between time-ordered measures of youth perceptions of mother, father, and best friends’ likely reactions to participant deviance, the youth’s own AD, and the youth’s level of participation in subsequent delinquency were tested in a sample of 3,880 adolescents (mean age = 15.33 years at the start of the study, 50.6% male). A moderated mediation path analysis revealed that perceived acceptance of participant deviance by the individual’s best friends predicted a rise in participant positive attitudes toward deviance, which, in turn, led to a rise in future delinquency. There was no effect, however, for mother or father perceived attitudes toward participant deviance. These results further revealed that the effect was moderated by sex and only significant in boys. From these results, it can be surmised that best friends’ perceived reactions to deviance may have an indirect effect on future delinquency of male youth by shaping and influencing the youth’s own AD. © 2021 Georgia State University.

AB  - The global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world in many ways. Due to the communicable nature of the disease, it is difficult to investigate the causal reason for the epidemic's spread sufficiently. This study comprehensively investigates the causal relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and mobility level on a multi time-scale and its influencing factors, by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the causal decomposition approach. Linear regression analysis investigates the significance and importance of the influential factors on the intrastate and interstate causal strength. The results of an EEMD analysis indicate that the mid-term and long-term domain portrays the macroscopic component of the states’ mobility level and COVID-19 cases, which represents overall intrinsic characteristics. In particular, the mobility level is highly associated with the long-term variations of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term variations. Intrastate causality analysis identifies the significant effects of median age and political orientation on the causal strength at a specific time-scale, and some of them cannot be identified from the existing method. Interstate causality results show a negative association with the interstate distance and the positive one with the airline traffic in the long-term domain. Clustering analysis confirms that the states with the higher the gross domestic product and the more politically democratic tend to more adhere to social distancing. The findings of this study can provide practical implications to the policymakers that whether the social distancing policies are effectively working or not should be monitored by long-term trends of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Social media technologies have been widely adopted by governments to increase civic engagement, promote openness, and extend services. Previous research finds that public managers’ attitudes are important predictors of social media adoption and successful implementation. Managers’ attitudes may vary due to different organizational structures, functions, and operations based on department type or because departments vary along with key dimensions. This research investigates the following questions: (1) Does department type significantly predict public managers’ attitudes toward social media, (2) does department type moderate the effect of predictors of managers’ attitudes toward social media found in previous research, and (3) do the predictors of managers’ attitudes toward social media found in previous research mediate attitude differences observed across different kinds of departments. Using data collected from a 2014 national web survey in the United States on technology in city government, we find department type is an important predictor of managers’ attitudes toward social media use. The effects of other predictors of attitudes toward social media use were not moderated by department type. Instead, those predictors had similar effects regardless of department type. Some of the variables related to organizational characteristics and culture (e.g., social media use, innovativeness, and use of e-services) helped to explain differences between the attitudes of managers from different departments. Our findings are important for developing strategies to target managers’ negative attitudes toward using social media, thus removing one of the barriers to successful technology implementation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Pulse oximetry has potential for identifying hypoxaemic pneumonia and substantially reducing under-five deaths in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) setting. However, there are few examples of introducing pulse oximetry in resource-constrained paediatric outpatient settings, such as Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) services. Methods: The National IMCI-programme of Bangladesh designed and developed a district implementation model for introducing pulse oximetry in routine IMCI services through stakeholder engagement and demonstrated the model in Kushtia district adopting a health system strengthening approach. Between December 2020 and June 2021, two rounds of assessment were conducted based on WHO's implementation research framework and outcome variables, involving 22 IMCI service-providers and 1680 children presenting with cough/difficulty-in-breathing in 12 health facilities. The data collection procedures included structured-observations, re-assessments, interviews, and data-extraction by trained study personnel. Findings: We observed that IMCI service-providers conducted pulse oximetry assessments on all eligible children in routine outpatient settings, of which 99% of assessments were successful; 85% (95% CI 83,87) in one attempt, and 69% (95% CI 67,71) within one minute. The adherence to standard operating procedure related to pulse oximetry was 92% (95% CI 91,93), and agreement regarding identifying hypoxaemia was 97% (95% CI 96,98). The median performance-time was 36 seconds (IQR 20,75), which was longer among younger children (2-11 months: 44s, IQR 22,78; 12-59 months: 30s, IQR 18,53, p < 0.01) and among those classified as pneumonia/severe-pneumonia than as no-pneumonia (41s, IQR 22,70; 32s, IQR 20,62, p < 0.01). We observed improvements in almost all indicators in round-2. IMCI service-providers and caregivers showed positive attitudes towards using this novel technology for assessing their children. Interpretation: This implementation research study suggested the adoption, feasibility, fidelity, appropriateness, acceptability, and sustainability of pulse oximetry introduction in routine IMCI services in resource-poor settings. The learning may inform the evidence-based scale-up of pulse oximetry linked with an oxygen delivery system in Bangladesh and other LMICs. Funding: This research was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) (Global Health Research Unit on Respiratory Health (RESPIRE); 16/136/109) using UK aid from the UK Government to support global health research. © 2022

AB  - Background: The uncertain and stressful global situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to cause anxiety and impact people's mental health. Simultaneously, social distancing policies have isolated people from their normal social interactions. These societal changes have inevitably influenced gambling and gaming practices, and many people may have turned to betting or gaming as a means of social exchange. This study examined the influence of COVID-19 anxiety on increased mental health problems and their relationship to gambling and gaming problems. The mediating role of social motives for gambling and gaming was also investigated. Material and methods: Finnish adults (N = 1530; Mage = 46.67; 50.33% male) were recruited from a volunteer participant panel to participate in a survey study. COVID-19 anxiety was assessed using a scale adapted from the Spielberger State–Trait Anxiety Inventory. Mental health problems were evaluated with the five-item Mental Health Inventory. Gambling problems were measured using the Problem Gambling Severity Index, and gaming problems were measured with the Internet Gaming Disorder Test. Social motives for gaming were evaluated using a single-item measure. Analyses used generalised structural equation modelling. Results: COVID-19 anxiety predicted increased mental health problems, which were associated with heightened gambling and gaming problems. Social motives for gambling and gaming were a significant mediator, suggesting that gambling and gaming problems are emphasized markedly among those who are socially motivated by and involved in such games. Conclusions: Mental health problems experienced during the pandemic and the social properties of games might accentuate gambling and gaming problems. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 has had a huge worldwide influence. Vaccinations are a crucial component of illness prevention. Thailand's vaccination program for children above the age of five is in its initial stages. Many Thai parents are still unwilling to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of parental hesitancy and influential variables among Thai parents and guardians living in Thailand. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey in Thailand during October and November of 2021. Through online social media networks, an online survey (REDcap) was distributed. Thai parents and guardians with at least one child under the age of 18 were invited to participate. Results: A total of 1064 responses for analysis. One thousand and sixty-four were available for analysis with 74.4% of those who participated being female. The results found that the parental COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy rate was higher among parents with children under the age of 12 than among parents with children over the age of 12. (56.9% vs 17.1%, p-value < 0.001). Parents were more concerned about vaccination side effects (82.5%), safety (60.0%), and vaccine efficacy (37.2%). Low vaccine reluctance among parent with children age less than 12 years old was associated with higher education (aOR = 0.35, 95 %CI = 0.13–0.93, p-value = 0.036) and a favorable attitude regarding covid-19 immunizations (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04–0.67, p-value 0.012) Conclusion: The majority of Thai parents with children under the age of 12 were hesitant to vaccinate against COVID-19. To minimize Thai parent vaccination hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake among children, the government and health care providers should target this population with evidence-based information, promote positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations, and encourage educated parents to vaccinate their children at first. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The author explores interactions with one research subject who feigns credentials and invents stories in order to participate in social science research interviews online. The possibility of intentional deception among interviewees in virtually mediated fieldwork is a critical consideration in the context of the recent extensive pivot to online-based fieldwork during the need for social distancing associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Following this rapid shift in what is generally accepted as the “gold standard” for social science research interviews, widespread use of online-based interviewing methods will likely endure as equivalent to in-person methods. A methodological case study with implications for virtually mediated fieldwork, this article highlights some of the advantages and disadvantages of virtually mediated interviews and provides practical suggestions. © American Sociological Association 2022.

AB  - It has recently been found that individuals high in autistic traits tend to believe that they are usually not treated fairly. In the present study, it is assumed that such a lowered personal belief in a just world is based on cumulative humiliation experiences that stem from autistic pragmatic language problems (e.g., communicating in a monotonous voice, not being “in tune” with others during conversations). Furthermore, the less individuals believe that they receive fair treatment, the more they may develop a negative attitude toward human nature (i.e., believing that humans are generally untrustworthy, unfair, and unhelpful). The serial multiple mediation model reflecting these assumptions received initial empirical support in a nonclinical sample (N = 344). Implications for professional health care are addressed. © 2022 The Author

AB  - Background: Caring for a child with cystic fibrosis (CF) is challenging and stressful and even more so in a country with limited resources. Our aim was to study the impact of CF on the daily life of mothers with children who have CF in Tunisia, emphasizing the difficulties encountered. Methods: Overall, 20 participants were interviewed about their experiences of being caregivers and mothers of children with CF, including their knowledge about the condition, their attitude toward it, the impact of CF on their daily lives, the main difficulties they had faced, and their concerns and wishes about CF management. Results: The median age of the interviewees was 39 years. None of the mothers had known about CF before; 14 of them had difficulty accepting it at first, with suicidal thoughts in one case. Six hid the illness from the close family for fear of negative prejudices. Three mothers decided to stop having children despite availability of prenatal screening. CF also influenced the mothers’ social activities (n = 13) and interfered with their jobs (n = 5). It was responsible for additional expenses in all cases. Chest physiotherapy represented a daily source of coping for all participants. Hospitalization related to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was considered stressful and constraining by 12 mothers. The mothers’ main concern was the child's life expectancy (n = 7). Their main wish was to administer a curative treatment (n = 17). Conclusion: CF was found to have deeply affected the mothers’ psychosocial life stressing the need for the involvement of qualified psychologists and social workers together with the medical staff. © 2022 French Society of Pediatrics

AB  - Wearing a facemask can help to decrease the transmission of COVID-19. We investigated self-reported mask use among subjects aged 18 years and older participating in the COVID-19 Community Research Partnership (CRP), a prospective longitudinal COVID-19 surveillance study in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States. We included those participants who completed ≥5 daily surveys each month from December 1, 2020 through August 31, 2021. Mask use was defined as self-reported use of a face mask or face covering on every interaction with others outside the household within a distance of less than 6 feet. Participants were considered vaccinated if they reported receiving ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose. Participants (n = 17,522) were 91% non-Hispanic White, 68% female, median age 57 years, 26% healthcare workers, with 95% self-reported receiving ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose through August 2021; mean daily survey response was 85%. Mask use was higher among vaccinated than unvaccinated participants across the study period, regardless of the month of the first dose. Mask use remained relatively stable from December 2020 through April (range 71–80% unvaccinated; 86–93% vaccinated) and declined in both groups beginning in mid-May 2021 to 34% and 42% respectively in June 2021; mask use increased again since July 2021. Mask use by all was lower during weekends and on Christmas and Easter, regardless of vaccination status. Independent predictors of higher mask use were vaccination, age ≥65 years, female sex, racial or ethnic minority group, and healthcare worker occupation, whereas a history of self-reported prior COVID-19 illness was associated with lower use. © 2022

AB  - Identifying factors that influence adolescent intentions for COVID-19 vaccination is essential for developing strategic interventions to increase uptake, particularly in subgroups of at-risk adolescents. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescence is characterized by difficulties regulating attention and behavior, social impairment, and impulsive risk-taking behaviors, which may impact vaccine hesitancy and vaccine uptake. This study examined hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among adolescents with and without ADHD, and explored how ADHD status interacted with malleable social mechanisms and other social determinants of health in predicting vaccine hesitancy. Participants were 196 U.S. adolescents (44.4% male), 45.6% diagnosed with ADHD. Adolescents reported their confidence and willingness toward COVID-19 vaccines from March to May 2021. Adolescents with ADHD reported greater hesitancy and less confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety compared to adolescents without ADHD (p < .01). Only 61.8% of adolescents with ADHD reported vaccine acceptance, compared to 81.3% of adolescents without ADHD. For all adolescents, those who identified as Black or Latinx and with lower family income had greater hesitancy and reduced confidence, whereas greater COVID-19 concerns, media use, and perceived negative impact on relationships was associated with greater vaccination willingness. Social contextual processes significantly interacted with ADHD status such that for adolescents without ADHD, concerns about COVID-19 were associated with increased confidence in vaccine safety. Being noncompliant with social distancing guidelines was associated with greater vaccine hesitancy, only for adolescents with ADHD. A concerted effort is needed to increase trust, confidence, and social relevance among adolescents, especially those with ADHD and from lower socio-economic backgrounds. © 2022

AB  - Problem: Many studies focus on knowledge and attitudes of unaffected people towards epilepsy and people with epilepsy (PWE). The perspective of PWE themselves is much less explored. Methods: We invited PWE in Germany to answer a questionnaire on their knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy and PWE. Results: The questionnaire was completed by 230 PWE (median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66 % female). Of PWE, 22 % thought that PWE are more helpful, and 10 % thought that PWE are friendlier than other people. Nevertheless, reservations about relationships and friendships with other PWE existed: of the participants, only 74 % would definitely go on a date with another PWE, and 90 % would definitely include another PWE they liked into their circle of friends. Swimming was judged as more dangerous for PWE than for healthy people by 71 % of PWE. Of PWE, 86 % correctly assumed it was not useful to hold a person having a seizure to the ground. Putting a solid object in the mouth was considered not useful by 85 % of PWE. Of PWE, 20 % would definitely administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure. For 67 % of PWE, certain preconditions should have to be fulfilled such as an available document with instructions. Of PWE, 11 % stated they would not administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure. Conclusion: Although positive attitudes of PWE towards other PWE exist, we also found some reservations calling for psychosocial support. Most PWE had sufficient knowledge about risks of certain activities and about measures to be taken during a seizure. Nevertheless, a small group of PWE showed knowledge gaps. Thus, educational support still seems essential. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered growing public interest in veganism, veganism's conceptualization remains ambiguous. Moreover, vegans' and nonvegans' different perspectives have rarely been addressed. Hence, this study involved the opinions of both vegans and nonvegans in the COVID-19 context to understand their attitudes, motivations, and opinions related to veganism. We analyzed online discourses in vegan and antivegan online communities using Word2Vec analysis and qualitative analysis. We identified lists of terms associated with three key veganism dimensions (i.e., lifestyle, animal rights, and food). Moreover, we compared actual online discussions among vegans to those among nonvegans regarding specific veganism attributes. This study preliminarily identifies specific attributes associated with veganism in online discourse among vegans. The issues addressed in this study can be tested in future research. Our findings can also be useful for people in various stages of veganism—such as active vegans, people who are interested in veganism, or even nonvegans who are uninterested in veganism—to comprehend the different perceptions prevailing in each group. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Early in the pandemic and prior to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, prevention measures were promoted to help inhibit the spread of the virus. To optimize adherence to prevention practices, it’s important to understand factors that may influence adherence. A study was conducted in the month of April, 2020, to explore the influence of perceptions of COVID-19 on prevention practices. The sample included members of a public social-media group focused on providing updates and information on COVID-19. A total of 719 individuals completed an online survey that assessed various aspects of COVID-19 which included experience, perceptions, and prevention practices. The perceptions of COVID-19 included perceived susceptibility of contracting the virus, and perceived potential severity if contracted COVID-19. To assess prevention practices, the survey included a 10-item prevention practices questionnaire that included items such as wearing a mask, and social distancing. Results revealed that perceived susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, and potential severity of COVID-19 were significant in predicting prevention practices. Further, results suggest that perceived potential severity predicts a greater proportion of the variance in prevention practices than susceptibility of contracting COVID-19. In addition, a moderation analysis revealed no interaction between perceived susceptibility and severity, which provides evidence that the variables do not influence one another. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Ethnic diversity and interethnic contact are increasing in Europe. Intergroup contact theory suggests interethnic contact to improve interethnic attitudes, but for young children, parental attitudes toward child interethnic relations might be an important factor determining whether they are exposed to these potentially positive contact effects. This study therefore examined maternal attitudes toward child contact with different ethnic outgroups among 251 mothers (137 White Dutch, 69 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of a 6- to 10-year-old child (M = 7.51, SD = 0.98). Furthermore, associations between maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations and child outgroup rejection were examined, as well as mediation effects of child actual outgroup contact. Neutral to positive maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations were found, with relatively more negative attitudes among Turkish-Dutch than White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers, and toward child relations with Muslims as compared to another outgroup among White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers. Furthermore, results did not indicate that maternal attitudes were related to child actual outgroup contact or child outgroup prejudice and no support for the intergroup contact theory was found. These results suggest that intergroup contact theory does not easily apply, highlighting the need for more research on children in various populations and contexts using different measures and informants. Patterns from the present study suggest that most improvement in terms of maternal attitudes fostering child interethnic relations can be made in the interethnic relations including ethnic groups in the Netherlands that predominantly identify as Muslim. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Drawing on a multimodal approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this research critically examines the 2017 “burqa stunt” of Australian far-right populist politician, Pauline Hanson. Adapting Scalmer's (2002) conceptualisation of the “political gimmick”, this paper makes the following arguments: Firstly, that Hanson's “burqa stunt” must be understood as an articulation of Islamophobia and political performance. It was the interplay of Hanson's radical right and populist ideologies that informed the stunt. As such, this paper bridges the ideational and performative approaches to populism. Secondly, the stunt was the product of the mediatisation of politics and the logics that govern contemporary media in Australia. The aim of Hanson's stunt was clear: to generate controversy and media attention. In this, the “burqa stunt” was incredibly successful and was extensively covered both nationally and internationally. The stunt was the most overt expression of the anti-Muslim racism that has defined Hanson's contemporary political resurgence. This paper furthers our growing understanding of how far-right populist actors strategically employ performance strategies designed to generate controversy and media attention. It also highlights how racist far-right actors are able to articulate Islamophobia in novel ways that exploit the logics of the contemporary media environment. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Previous research has linked people’s relational attachment orientations to emotional reactions and coping during crises, and to social trust and trust in societal institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis for which collective efforts, such as social distancing, are necessary to stop the spread of the virus. During previous pandemics, people high in trust have typically adhered to such efforts. In the present study, we investigated whether attachment orientations were related to people’s adherence to authorities’ guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19. We also tested whether previous mediational findings—linking attachment-related avoidance to welfare state trust via social trust—would replicate. We used a web-based survey of 620 participants. Our findings showed that attachment-related anxiety was linked to low adherence to social distancing regulations. This finding was especially noteworthy because high attachment-anxious participants also experienced more negative emotions, yet negative emotions were generally linked to high adherence. Thus, people higher in attachment anxiety seem to have more difficulties in avoiding social situations despite heightened risk of catching and spreading the virus. In addition, attachment-related avoidance was negatively related to adherence and to welfare state trust, and its effects on welfare state trust were statistically mediated by low social trust. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Resilience – the ability to bounce back from hardship – is a concept that has become popular during the years of economic crisis and post-recession. Contemporary citizens are expected to be flexible, have a positive attitude and take care of themselves in a context of heightened inequality and precarity. The objective of this article is to analyze how citizens in post-recession Spain respond to media representations that prescribe these values. Eight focus groups were held with middle- and working-class men and women (a total of 62 participants) who discussed four short stories written by the researchers, which condensed the main concepts found in media narratives studied previously (including TV series, reality TV, advertisements, video games and celebrity culture). The results of our analysis show that participants tended to praise change and adaptability. The ‘complacent citizen’, who seeks security and refuses to adapt to the current precarious and unstable environments, emerges as a ‘bad citizen’, and security and stability are pathologized. There were differences between the middle- and working-class groups: while the former clearly adhered to the neoliberal discourse that sees flexibility and self-improvement as a moral obligation, the latter showed a more ambivalent response to these discourses. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study investigated whether negative stereotypes are responsible for the effect of ASD knowledge on social distance from individuals with ASD among college students. A sample of 869 neurotypical Chinese college students completed a cross-sectional survey to assess social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Pearson correlation analysis yielded significant correlations between social distance, ASD knowledge, and negative stereotypes. Multiple mediation analysis showed that negative stereotypes mediated the link between social distance and ASD knowledge. Specifically, greater ASD knowledge predicted reduced social distance through decreased stereotyping related to dangerousness, personal responsibility for the disorder, and discontinuity, but also predicted greater social distance through increased stereotyping related to social inappropriateness. The findings deepen our understanding of the association between ASD knowledge and social distance by revealing the mediating role of negative stereotypes, and provide information that can help improve anti-stigma initiatives in college settings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in late 2019 brought severe devastation to the world. The pandemic spread across the globe, infecting more than ten million people and disrupting several businesses. Although social distancing and the use of protective masks were suggested all over the world, the cases seem to rise, which led to worldwide lockdown in different phases. The rampant escalation in the number of cases, the global effects, and the lockdown may have a severe effect on the psychology of people. The emergency protocols implemented by the authorities also lead to increased use in the number of multimedia devices. Excessive use of such devices may also contribute to psychological disorders. Hence, hence it is necessary to analyze the state of mind of people during the lockdown. In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis of Twitter data during the pandemic lockdown, i.e., two weeks and four weeks after the lockdown was imposed. Investigating the sentiments of people in the form of positive, negative, and neutral tweets would assist us in determining how people are dealing with the pandemic and its effects on a psychological level. Our study shows that the lockdown witnessed more number positive tweets globally on multiple datasets. This is indicative of the positivity and optimism based on the sentiments and psychology of Twitter users worldwide. The study will be effective in determining people’s mental well-being and will also be useful in devising appropriate lockdown strategies and crisis management in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Fostering inclusive attitudes among children in host classrooms is key to integrating refugee children. A field experiment tests the prejudice reduction effects of a teacher-led activity integrating imagined intergroup contact and normative influence. To enhance the effectiveness of imagined contact, scenarios include supportive ingroup norms. In 29 classes, 545 children (Mage = 10.88, SD = 0.96) were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: standard imagined contact, imagined contact encouraged by family, class peers, or religious ingroups, or a control. Children in all norm-framed imagined contact conditions had significantly less antirefugee bias compared with the control. The class-peer norm frame significantly reduced affective and cognitive facets of bias. The family norm frame reduced affective bias, and the religious norm frame reduced cognitive bias. Standard imagined contact did not differ from the control. Potential mediating pathways are explored. These findings illustrate the utility of incorporating norms into imagined contact interventions to reduce antirefugee bias among schoolchildren. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Given recent and growing societal movements focusing on sexual assault, such as the #MeToo Movement, it is imperative to understand current attitudes about sexual assault and these movements. The aim of this study was to examine negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault in the context of the #MeToo Movement by qualitatively analyzing social media posts (i.e., tweets) containing the hashtag “metoo” on Twitter, a popular social media platform. The initial sample consisted of 4,559 tweets that were publicly posted by Twitter users across a four-day timeframe and represented events and attitudes regarding both about an accuser and an accused. Data were cleaned and coded, and a remaining 508 tweets were included because they contained content that was categorized as negative in their attitudes or beliefs (either through attitudes of condemnation or ambivalence towards accusers and/or the #MeToo Movement). Results from a qualitative content analysis of tweets demonstrated that negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault within the context of the #MeToo Movement were conveyed through six main themes: (1) invalidating the accusations made as part of the #MeToo Movement; (2) insisting, and likely believing, that accusations made were false; (3) claiming that there were alternative motives for those accusations; (4) showing a concern for the harm that accusations may cause those accused; (5) exhibiting concerns about the effects of the Movement on male power, privilege, and status; and (6) questioning the integrity of the #MeToo Movement as a whole. These findings provide a deeper understanding of attitudes and beliefs about the #MeToo Movement, including novel beliefs not often addressed in the literature. Most importantly, these findings show that rape culture continues to persist despite current interventions and social movements. Results underscore the need for future interventions that aim to educate and improve societal attitudes towards sexual assault. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - There remains an obvious gap in the acculturation literature, which relates to cultural change associated with the majority/dominant group. This paper explores how majority members react to a perceived expectation from minority members that majority members should undergo cultural change. A study was conducted exploring how majority members' perceptions of a demand by minority members that the majority should adopt the minority culture affects the majority members' preferences for minority acculturation, and whether effects are mediated by perceptions of symbolic threat. Two hundred sixty-six participants who self-reported being white British completed an online survey. A model was hypothesized whereby a perception that minority members demand that the majority takes on the minority culture predicted perceived symbolic threat, which was in turn negatively associated with a desire that minority members should maintain the minority culture, and positively with a desire that minority members should adopt the majority culture. Results supported the hypothesized model, with all individual paths and indirect effects significant in the hypothesized directions. Symbolic threat mediated the effect of perceived demand for minority culture adoption on majority preferences for minority acculturation. Findings are discussed in relation to implications for intergroup relations in culturally plural societies. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Academic social networking sites (ASNS) are trending in academics and play a significant role in disseminating knowledge. The study aims to explore the usage of ASNS by the faculty members and researchers of NIFT Centers across India. An online questionnaire method used to collect the primary data from 17 NIFT Centers. According to the results of the data analysis, the majority of respondents were aware of and utilised academic social networking sites (ASNS) in NIFT Centers. Google Scholar achieved the highest level of awareness and usage (34.98 %), followed by ResearchGate (27.09 %), Linkedin (18.23 %), and Academia.edu (17.24 %). The findings indicate that faculty members and researchers use ASNS primarily to access freely available millions of research papers, slightly less for communicating in a new way with researchers, and very rarely for increasing citations of research papers. Finally, the results reveal a positive attitude towards using famous academic social networking sites. NIFT should organise workshops and seminars on ASNS platforms to raise awareness and visibility of their research. © 2022, DESIDOC.

AB  - This study draws on the ecological perspective of teacher agency to examine the manifestation of English teachers' agency toward the ongoing curriculum reform in China and the factors that impact it. This study surveyed 353 high school English teachers and then collected data from three case study participants through in-depth interviews. The findings showed that the majority of teachers surveyed exhibited positive attitudes and beliefs about implementing the reform and inclinations to change, but the teachers also showed a constrained state of agency in practice. Teacher agency developed as the teachers exerted sustained pedagogical change and reflection on reform-based practices. Through the findings, prior experiences and reform-oriented beliefs were found to mediate teachers' agency, and reform-related experiences were more influential than future goals in shaping agency. The factors of perceived school culture that involved teachers' interaction with students, colleague cooperation, and administrative support also medicated teachers' agency in practice. Implications are proposed for policymakers and school leaders to help teachers coordinate inconsistencies between high-stakes examination preparation and holistic education and make positive sense of professional development in the context of educational changes.

AB  - The travel bubble program presented an appealing strategy for reopening international travel safely. However, a full vaccination regime is the foremost prerequisite of the program. Therefore, vaccination and the travel bubble are inextricably linked. This study investigated the roles of perceived vaccine efficacy, attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and attitude toward the travel bubble on travel bubble intention. More importantly, the study also examined the mediating role of hope and fear among unvaccinated Korean adults between 20 and 29 years old. A total of 535 samples were collected to test the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. In general, the results supported the proposed hypotheses. Notably, the intention to travel to a bubble destination was explained by 57% of the variance. Furthermore, hope mediated the relationship between vaccine attitude and travel bubble intention. Whereas fear mediated the relationship between perceived vaccine efficacy and intention. Hence, the findings suggest doubts around the vaccine efficacy and that a positive attitude towards the vaccine also install hope among the research samples.

AB  - The effects of intergroup contact in reducing prejudices have been well documented, but few studies have investigated the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. This article examines the predictors of social distance from Muslims in a large sample of (non-Muslim) German university students (N = 404). Intergroup contact was an important predictor of reduced social distance even after demographics and perceptions of parents, tertiary institutions, media and broader intergroup dynamics were taken into account. The contact-social distance relationship was, however, mediated in part by perceived parental support for intergroup relations and perceived fairness of media representation. Students’ perceptions of broader group dynamics relating to assigning positive and negative attributes largely impeded the relationship – more so for male students than female. The findings attest to the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. Having contact with outgroup members leads to reduced social distance from the outgroup, but perceived norms and outgroup perceptions play a pivotal role in explaining this relationship. © Equinox Publishing Ltd. 2022.

AB  - Background: Disruption to everyday routine during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable implications for global mental health. The inter- and intra-personal mechanisms by which disrupted routine can contribute to elevated depressive symptoms has not been well-explored. The present study aimed to examine how feelings of social (dis)connectedness and rumination, as a maladaptive coping strategy, could explain the association between disrupted well-being activities and depressive symptoms. Methods: Participants (N = 496) ranging in age from 18 to 73 years (M = 28.73, SD = 10.93) completed an online survey within the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included measures of disruption to usual psychological and physical well-being activities, social connectedness, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness and rumination were investigated as serial mediators of the association between disrupted well-being activities and depression using Hayes' PROCESS macro. Results: 39.5% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of depression. Disruption to well-being activities predicted higher depressive symptoms, and this was partially explained by feelings of social disconnectedness and subsequent rumination. Rumination, alone, was not a significant mediator between disrupted routine and depressive symptoms. Limitations: The cross-sectional survey design does not preclude the possibility of bidirectional effects. Conclusion: The social distancing public health measures to combat COVID-19 have contributed to widespread disrupted routine, and in turn, elevated symptoms of depression. Social disconnectedness plays a particularly important role in this association. Intervention strategies should consider social factors as a ‘social cure’ for mass, positive mental health promotion during COVID-19. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Methods of communications and the nature of messaging are critically important in influencing public behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to all aspects of life globally and has triggered multiple approaches of health messaging to the general public to communicate COVID-19 preventative measures. This study aimed to identify: (1) differences between age groups in the main avenues used by people to obtain COVID-19 related information; and (2) whether age and information sources were associated with correct interpretation of government messaging relating to how people understand or interpret the terms “self-isolation” and “social distancing.” An online survey was conducted in 2020. Participants were aged over 18 years and grouped into age group decades. Differences in sources of COVID-19 information were compared visually between age groups. Logistic regression was used to determine whether age and each of the various methods of communication of COVID-19 information were independently associated with correct response to the self-isolation, or the social distancing statements. There were 3,300 survey respondents 85% female; age sub-groups: 18–29 (7.4%); 30–39 (10.6%); 40–49 (17.6%); 50–59 (22.9%); 60–69 (25.9%); 70–79 (13.9%); and 80+ (1.7%). People accessed public health messaging information from a wide variety of sources that changed as they aged (e.g., older people were more likely to be exposed to COVID-19 information via television news programs and less likely via social media platforms). Age was frequently associated with whether the message key terms were interpreted correctly or incorrectly, but in some cases, it promoted more correct responses whereas in others, fewer correct responses. There was no difference between being exposed to COVID-19 information via mainstream media, compared with social media, or compared with Government sources of information, in terms of whether COVID-19 messages were interpreted correctly. In order to improve future public health messaging, there is a need for multiple avenues of communication to meet the needs and preferences across and within age groups. Further investigation is warranted into the clarity of the content and method of delivery of public health messages, to ensure optimal understanding of public health messages by vulnerable populations and across the community.

AB  - Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, government risk communication to the public was among the critical works, as the governments had to fight two enemies at once: the pandemic itself and the infodemic surrounding the COVID-19. Government risk communication could provide the public with prompt and accurate information as well as eliminate fake news, rumors and misinformation, thereby raising the public’s knowledge and risk perception and, thus, shaping their compliance with the government’s advices and directives. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of government risk communication through mass media on the public’s knowledge, risk perception and compliance with safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The ordinary least square and probit regression models were used for analyzing data collected from citizens living in Vietnam during the COVID-19 social distancing. Findings: The results of this paper show that government risk communication enhances the public’s knowledge of the COVID-19 and raises their risk perception of the virus. In addition, government risk communication is found to shape the public’s compliance with most safety measures. Practical implications: This paper offers practical implications for containing a pandemic (especially in the context that vaccines are unavailable or insufficient) by emphasizing the role of government risk communication. Originality/value: This paper is among the first attempts that examine the role of government risk communication through mass media in enhancing the public’s knowledge, their risk perception and their compliance with safety measures during a pandemic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a high-burden respiratory infectious disease. There was a sharp decline in the number of confirmed TB cases during the pandemic; this is likely to be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic response, with under-reporting due to resource diversion. There are typically 13,000 tuberculosis-associated deaths in Afghanistan annually, with significant problems posed by drug-resistant TB. Method: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in Afghanistan on Kabul residents who visited the adult outpatient departments of public hospitals for any health-related reason from 1st January to 20th March 2022. The study scored their knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) toward tuberculosis. The sample size was calculated using Epi-Info, and the minimum sample size was 385. The sampling method is chosen the non-probability convenient sampling for data gathering. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 28, and we used the Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square or fisher extract test, spearman correlations, and binary logistic regression model. Results: Of 829 participants, 450 (54.3%) were males and 379 (45.7) females. The median age was 28 years, and 63.3% were married. Most participants were unemployed (75.5%), but 54% had a monthly income >3,000 Afghanis, indicating the reliance on family. By TB knowledge score, 727 (87.7%) participants had good knowledge, and 800 (96.5%) participants had a positive attitude toward treatment and control. Only 2 participants reported poor practices regarding prevention. Regarding the binary logistic regression, young age, being a male, belonging to the “1,000–3,000” Afghani monthly income category, and having a positive attitude were significant predictors of good TB knowledge (P-value = 0.009, 0.000, 0.003, and 0.009), respectively. A positive attitude was expected to have good knowledge 6.035 times more than a negative attitude (95% CI: 1.572–23.167). Conclusion: The study findings highlighted that outpatients in Kabul had good knowledge, attitude, and practice toward TB. More studies are needed to highlight KAP in different Afghan populations, including in other parts of the country. Copyright © 2022 Essar, Rezayee, Ahmad, Kamal, Nasery, Danishmand, Head and Nemat.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article was to explore the influence of individual perception and social climate on consumer-initiated group-buying purchase decisions. An extended cross-level research model was used to explain how a new mechanism for purchasing through personal interactions could work. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised a questionnaire survey for data gathering. The subjects of the investigation were group-buying initiators. Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) was used to experimentally examine the research hypotheses. Findings: The empirical results of the study indicate that the social influence of critical mass can effectively promote positive attitudes and intentions towards consumer-initiated online group buying. An individuals' perception of an initiator's fairness influences their trust in the initiator. In addition, trust in the initiator can positively and significantly influence buyers' attitudes and intentions to online group buying. Originality/value: Most previous studies on online group-buying focus on how social media influences group-buying behaviours. This study extends social media research by introducing an extended cross-level model to provide a comprehensive investigation into online-shopping. It is a preliminary attempt to systematically verify relationships at the individual and aggregate levels. The decision to group buying requires a relationship of trust to be formed before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the intention to make a purchase. As a result, group buying is perceived as positive when interpersonal communication is very efficient, or when social influence is high. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In Thailand, strict prevention and control strategies have been implemented to mitigate the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). “New normal” guidelines and a series of mobile health applications have been introduced by the healthcare sector and implemented to aid the disease control monitoring and prevention of widespread outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding “new normal” guidelines and quality of life (QOL) among Thai people during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to determine the association between KA, QOL, and practices. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 7 June to 12 September 2021 among Thai people in Public Health Region 6 aged ≥ 18 years old. Of the 506 survey participants, 80.3% were female, and 65.0% were 25–59 years old. The survey revealed that 52.2% of participants were classified as having more accurate knowledge, 58.9% were classified as having more positive attitudes, and 80.8% were classified as having more frequent practices regarding “new normal” guidelines, and 54.7% had high QOL. Of the participants, 93.7% agreed that “people who have been fully vaccinated should wear a mask while outside,” and 95.5% wore a face mask outdoors in crowded places. However, 60.9% of participants misunderstood some details regarding online applications for contact tracing and vaccination services, 44.2% felt that these applications were difficult to use, and 33.4% rarely or never downloaded or used these applications. In logistic regression analyses, accurate knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with higher education, being a government employee, monthly family income > 30,000 Thai Baht, and regular use of social media. More positive attitudes regarding “new normal” guidelines and high QOL were associated with positive practices. High QOL was associated with older age, and higher education. Enhancement of attitudes and QOL is also important for improving practices in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant factors identified in KAP will be crucial for developing effective prevention and control programs to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To implement mobile health applications effectively, more work is required to improve the ease of use and promotion strategies. Copyright © 2022 Waewwab, Pan-ngum, Siri, Bhopdhornangkul and Mahikul.

AB  - Research on combining social survey responses and social media posts has shown that the willingness to share social media accounts in surveys depends on the mode of the survey and certain socio-demographics of the respondents. We add new insights to this research by demonstrating that the willingness to share their Facebook and Twitter accounts also depends on the respondents' opinions on specific topics. Furthermore, we extend previous research by actually accessing their social media accounts and checking whether survey responses and tweets are coherent. Our analyses indicate that survey respondents who are willing to share their social media accounts hold more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 measures. The same pattern holds true when comparing their sentiments to a larger Twitter collection. Our results highlight another source of sampling bias when combining survey and social media data: a bias due to specific views, which might be related to social desirability.

AB  - The Delta variant became dominant during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its competitive advantage, the ability to reduce close contact duration from minutes to seconds, and, consequently, increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19. We used game theory to model the most effective public health response to this new threat. We compared the absolute and relative risk of exposure to COVID-19 before and after the emergence of the Delta variant. The absolute risk of exposure was defined as the product of crowding (people within a six feet distance) and visit duration. Our epidemiological investigation used aggregated and anonymized mobility data from Google Maps to estimate the visit duration for 808 premises in the metropolitan area of Genoa, Italy, in June 2021. The relative risk of exposure was obtained by dividing the risk of exposure of each activity by the lowest value (gas stations = 1). The median absolute risk of exposure to COVID-19 increased by sixty-fold in the first semester of 2021, while the relative risk did not significantly differ from the risk of exposure to the ancestral form of Covid-19 (5.9 in 2021 vs. 2.5 in 2021). The Delta variant represents an evolution of the game against COVID-19, but it is not a game-changer. The best response is to commit to our original strategy based on population-wide vaccination and social distancing. Unilateral deviations from the dominant strategy could offer COVID-19 a fighting chance against humanity. Copyright © 2022 Oliva and Favato.

AB  - Advances in gender equality and progressive policies are often stymied by cultural sexist systems and individual-level sexist attitudes. These attitudes are pervasive but vary in type—from benevolent to hostile and implicit to explicit. Understanding the types of sexism and their foundations are important for identifying connections to specific social and political attitudes and behaviors. The current study examines the impact of various manifestations of sexism on attitudes regarding policies and public opinion issues that involve gender equality or have gendered implications. More specifically, we look at attitudes on reproductive rights, support for the #MeToo Movement, equal pay, and paid leave policies. In Study 1 we use data from a high-quality web panel (n = 1,400) to look at the relationship between hostile, benevolent, and implicit sexism, and reproductive rights attitudes, as well as support for the #MeToo Movement. In Study 2 we use data from the American National Election Study (n = 4,270) to examine the relationship between hostile and modern sexism and attitudes on abortion, equal pay, and paid family leave. Overall, these results reveal a complicated relationship between different conceptualizations of sexism and gendered attitudes, underscoring the need to consider how different forms of sexism shape broader social and political views, from both a normative perspective for societal change and a measurement approach for research precision.

AB  - Reports an error in "The social neuroscience of music: Understanding the social brain through human song" by David M. Greenberg, Jean Decety and Ilanit Gordon (American Psychologist, 2021[Oct], Vol 76[7], 1172-1185). In the article, the authors highlight the role of oxytocin in music listening and production. Although there are decades of social neuroscience research supporting the social implications of oxytocin secretion in nonmusical settings, the implications of oxytocin in musical settings remain emergent. for example, although there is indeed evidence that group music making increases oxytocin (e.g., Good & Russo, 2021), there are exceptions that show that oxytocin can decrease (e.g., Fancourt et al., 2016). In the second paragraph of the Neurobiological Candidates section and the third paragraph of the Proposed Model section, the authors note these exceptions and add additional citations in support of the modulation of both oxytocin and cortisol. They also correct their citation of Schladt et al. (2017), whom they had incorrectly cited as showing an increase in oxytocin when their results showed a decrease. The online version of this article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2021-55326-001.) During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that people can adapt quickly to ensure that their social needs are met after being forced to isolate and socially distance. Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music. In a time when people across the globe have been unable to meet in person, they have found a way to meet in the music. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - Background: Healthcare providers are facing unprecedented challenges in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current situation compels the use of alternatives for communication between the patients and healthcare providers. The use of telemedicine has expanded globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. The range of online consultations varies from advising patients to providing diagnosis and follow-up. Methods: We assessed the attitudes of health professionals toward the use of social media for online consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic using an online survey that was distributed to medical professionals in Iraq. Results: The total number of participants was 124 Iraqi medical professionals in different specialties (72.4% men and 27.6% women). The majority of participants (71.6%) reported that they had previous experience with online consultation and patient communication using social media before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A large proportion of the participants (72.2%) indicated that online consultation was useful for patient health and safety. Conclusions: Despite the limitations facing online consultation and lack of proper infrastructure for telemedicine in Iraq, many health professionals indicated a positive attitude and recommend extending the use of online consultation after the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Al-Mansouri, AL-Obaidi, licensee HBKU Press.

AB  - Background: Family planning deficiencies are responsible for high maternal, newborn, and child mortality in Nigeria, and more than half of all death among adult female is linked to maternal death. Aim: To ascertain the predictors of good knowledge, positive attitudes, and ever practice family planning among public secondary school teachers in Enugu East Senatorial District, Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional research was carried out among public secondary school teachers aged between 18 and 60 years in Enugu East Senatorial District, Nigeria, using probability proportional to size sampling and systematic random sampling from a selection of 1,000 participants. Factors considered included sources of information on family planning, partner involvement, history of family planning methods, and healthcare facilities. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to establish the relationship. An odds ratio of 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated to ascertain the level of significance. Result: A majority (65.9%) of respondents had a good knowledge of family planning, more than half had positive attitudes (52.7%), and most of them had ever practice family planning (55.0%). Television (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.54-3.06) and social media (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI 1.29-2.78) were effective sources of information to establish significant predictors of good knowledge on family planning. Healthcare (AOR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.51-0.92) and partner discussion (AOR = 3.19; 95% CI 1.94-5.27) were also significant determinants of positive attitudes towards family planning. Cost of obtaining family planning methods (AOR = 0.003; 95% CI 0.001-0.013) and proximity of family planning facilities (AOR = 0.04; 95% CI 0.02-0.10) were notable predictors of ever practice family planning. Conclusion: The level of knowledge, attitudes, and ever practiced family planning among teachers are moderate and a significant number of predictors were identified. Effective awareness is recommended and making use of television as a channel to increase levels of knowledge will hopefully encourage utilization of family planning among teachers.

AB  - The unprecedented situation of countrywide lockdown with closure of physical schools, social distancing, and home confinement which arose due to COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the sleep and mood of all age groups. Adolescence is the age of transition from childhood to adulthood. Students in this phase are anxious with planning for future and thus fall an easy prey to unhealthy lifestyle including irregular sleep cycle and eating habits. Freedom to follow self-decided sleep schedule with extensive use of digital media and sedentary lifestyle during the pandemic further added to the trend of unhealthy lifestyle among them. This perspective is aimed to explore the effect of nationwide or regional lockdowns enforced for curtailment of COVID-19 infection on the mood and sleep habits of adolescents. There were some positive as well as negative impacts on the sleep quality and mood of adolescents. Although home confinement gave a lot of opportunities to follow own sleep schedules and eating habits such as those on weekends or vacations, it also increased the separation stress from their peers, anxiety and fear of disease, erratic sleep schedule, and screen time among adolescents. © 2022 Journal of Nature and Science of Medicine.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered stigmatic attitudes against health care workers. Some forms of social media may play a role in disseminating stigmatizing messages. Objective: We aimed to investigate the association between COVID-19 information sources and stigma against health care workers among college students during the pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted using a web-based platform in the Tohoku region of Japan. College students aged ≥20 years were asked to complete the questionnaire between August 18 and October 31, 2020. Stigma against health care workers was evaluated using a modified Japanese version of the Social Distance Scale. Participants were also asked to rate their perceived vulnerability to infection using the Japanese version of the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale. Results: A total of 281 students from 8 colleges completed the web-based survey. There were 139 (49.5%) participants who used Twitter, 187 (66.5%) who used news websites, and 46 (16.4%) who used the websites of public health agencies as COVID-19 information sources. After adjusting for age, sex, department, and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scores, the level of stigma did not differ between students who used Twitter and those who did not. Students who used the websites of public health agencies showed a significantly less stigmatic attitude than those who did not. Conclusions: Fact-checking and directing visitors to credible information sources from public health agencies may have prevented the formation of stigmatic attitudes toward health care workers. An effective strategy to enable easy access to information provided by public agencies should be integrated into widespread web-based platforms. © Miharu Nakanishi, Mai Sakai, Gen Takagi, Keita Toshi, Koubun Wakashima, Hatsumi Yoshii.

AB  - Background: On May 18, 2020, the New York State Department of Health implemented a statewide flavor ban to prohibit the sales of all flavored vapor products, except for tobacco or any other authorized flavor. Objective: This study aims to investigate the discussion changes in e-cigarette–related tweets over time with the implementation of the New York State flavor ban. Methods: Through the Twitter streaming application programming interface, 59,883 e-cigarette–related tweets were collected within the New York State from February 6, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (period 1, before the implementation of the flavor ban), May 18, 2020-June 30, 2020 (period 2, between the implementation of the flavor ban and the online sales ban), July 1, 2020-September 15, 2020 (period 3, the short term after the online sales ban), and September 16, 2020-November 30, 2020 (period 4, the long term after the online sales ban). Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were conducted to investigate the changes in public attitudes and discussions in e-cigarette–related tweets. The popularity of different e-cigarette flavor categories was compared before and after the implementation of the New York State flavor ban. Results: Our results showed that the proportion of e-cigarette–related tweets with negative sentiment significantly decreased (4305/13,246, 32.5% vs 3855/14,455, 26.67%, P<.001), and tweets with positive sentiment significantly increased (5246/13,246, 39.6% vs 7038/14,455, 48.69%, P<.001) in period 4 compared to period 3. “Teens and nicotine products” was the most frequently discussed e-cigarette–related topic in the negative tweets. In contrast, “nicotine products and quitting” was more prevalent in positive tweets. The proportion of tweets mentioning mint and menthol flavors significantly increased right after the flavor ban and decreased to lower levels over time. The proportions of fruit and sweet flavors were most frequently mentioned in period 1, decreased in period 2, and dominated again in period 4. Conclusions: The proportion of e-cigarette–related tweets with different attitudes and frequently discussed flavor categories changed over time after the implementation of the New York State ban of flavored vaping products. This change indicated a potential impact of the flavor ban on public discussions of flavored e-cigarettes. © Yankun Gao, Zidian Xie, Dongmei Li.

AB  - Background: Oral nicotine pouches are a new form of tobacco-free nicotine products launched in recent years with a variety of flavors. Objective: This study aims to examine the public perceptions and discussions of oral nicotine pouches on Reddit, a popular social media platform for sharing user experiences. Methods: Between February 15, 2019, and February 12, 2021, a total of 2410 Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches were obtained over a 2-year period. After the removal of unrelated or commercial posts, 653 Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches remained. Topics and sentiments related to oral nicotine pouches on Reddit were hand coded. Results: The number of Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches increased during the study period. Content analysis showed that the most popular topic was “sharing product information and user experience” (366/653, 56%), in which sharing oral nicotine pouch products and user experiences were dominant. The next popular topic was “asking product-related questions” (product properties and product recommendations; 115/653, 17.6%), followed by “quitting nicotine products” such as vaping or smoking through use of oral nicotine pouches or quitting the oral nicotine pouches themselves (83/653, 12.7%) and “discussing oral nicotine pouch-related health” symptoms or concerns related to oral nicotine pouches (74/653, 11.3%). The least popular topic was “legality and permissions” related to oral nicotine pouches (15/653, 2.3%). In addition, a greater number of Reddit posts described positive attitudes compared to negative attitudes toward oral nicotine pouches (354/653, 54.2% vs 101/653, 15.5%; P < .001). Conclusions: Reddit posts overall had a positive attitude toward oral nicotine pouches and users were actively sharing product and user experiences. Our study provides the first insight on up-to-date oral nicotine pouch discussions on social media. © Yihan Shao, Jonathan Zou, Zidian Xie, Rachel Grana Mayne, Deborah J Ossip, Irfan Rahman, Scott McIntosh, Dongmei Li.

AB  - Objectives: The public relies on various media sources and communication platforms for receipt of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) information. Therefore, identifying the primary sources of COVID-19 information among older adults can be valuable, as it can enable information on life-saving measures to be effectively disseminated to this population. Methods: We analyzed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement that was administrated from June 2020 through July 2020 (n = 8,050). A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between the sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all 3 recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). Results: Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all 3 recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet; 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20-2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.44-0.73). Discussion: Our findings can inform decision making about the effective communication sources to reach Medicare beneficiaries for public health messaging regarding preventive measures, including COVID-19 vaccination. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to undergraduate medical education globally, with worldwide implementation of social distancing and lock-down measures. This systematic review aims to identify challenges in undergraduate medical education during the pandemic and report creative approaches that have been employed to ensure continuity of education. Methods: A MEDLINE (PubMed) search was performed for articles published between 1 February 2020 and 1 September 2020, corresponding to the pandemic’s global upsurge. Studies, commentaries, perspectives, and correspondence reporting challenges, adaptations and innovations in undergraduate medical education were screened. Data was grouped in accordance with the research questions it sought to address and analysed qualitatively. Results: 43 studies were included. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lost opportunities for clinical exposure, reduced motivation, and heightened anxiety among medical students. Traditional teaching and assessment methods have transitioned to virtual platforms, harnessing video conferencing, social media, and virtual or augmented reality technologies. The long-term effectiveness of these solutions is uncertain, but immediate benefits conferred include increased access, improved time management, and cultivation of self-directed learning. The lack of authentic clinical experiences and patient interaction remains a major concern. Technical challenges and digital fatigue were also highlighted as pertinent challenges. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided unexpected, yet invaluable opportunities to explore new pedagogies that may be instrumental in shaping medical education in the new norm. As future members of the healthcare workforce, medical students should be integrated into current healthcare systems to equip them with knowledge and skills to manage future pandemics. © 2022 TAPS.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to explore the effect of cognitive behavioral stress management on the psychological status and pain stress response of parturients with cesarean section. Method: A total of 100 parturients who received cesarean delivery in Zhejiang Provincial People’s Hospital from April 2020 to April 2021 were recruited in this study and randomly divided into control group and study group. The control group received routine nursing care, while the study group received cognitive behavioral stress management for 12 weeks before delivery. The negative emotions, stress levels, hope levels and stress hormone levels in serum of the two groups were measured. Results: Before the intervention (T0), there was no significant difference between the two groups (all p > 0.05). Immediately after entering the operating room (T1) and at the end of the operation (T2), the scores of the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Pregnancy Stress Scale (PSS) in study group were significantly lower than those in control group (all p < 0.05). The hope level scale (HHI), the scores of positive attitude to reality and future (T), positive actions taken (P), and maintaining close relationship with others (I) in study group were markedly higher in the study group compared control group (all p < 0.05). The levels of cortisol (Cor), adrenaline (ADR) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in serum were significantly lower in study group than those in control group (all p < 0.05). Conclusion: Cognitive behavioral stress management intervention for parturients with cesarean section before delivery can effectively reduce their negative emotions and stresses, improve their level of hope and relieve their pain-induced stress. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that health constructs embraced by the Terror Management Theory (TMT) and the Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) may drive individuals’ COVID-19 health-related decisions. This study examines the relationships between existential concerns (ECs; within the TMT), basic psychological needs (BPNs; within the BPNT) and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), as well as the mediating role of negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from April to May 2021 on a sample of two hundred and eighty-seven adults (Mage = 36.04 ± 12.07; 59.9% females). Participants provided information regarding existential concerns, basic psychological needs, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine hesitancy for Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines separately. Higher vaccine hesitancy (32.1%) and vaccine resistance (32.8%) rates were found for AstraZeneca than for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (22.3% and 10.1%, respectively). Structural equation modeling showed that existential concerns were related to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccine hesitancy both directly and indirectly through negative attitudes toward potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. The findings of the study confirm that the TMT is efficient in explaining COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted efforts are needed to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, children’s physical health and access to mental health resources have been two critical concerns. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Health (PCIT-Health) is a treatment model aimed at helping parents manage children’s general behavior and their behavior in obesogenic contexts (screen time and mealtime). Due to social distancing guidelines, PCIT-Health was adapted for remote delivery through video conferencing. In this article, we describe the experience of implementing virtual PCIT-Health with a family. The family’s progress through treatment is described, along with the challenges associated with remote service delivery and how those challenges were addressed. Progress through treatment was measured with questionnaires administered to caregivers and with observational measures of parent-child interactions. The results from these measures indicate that caregivers experienced a reduction in stress and improvements in their child’s behavior after PCIT-Health completion. They also reported engaging in healthier management of their child’s screen time and mealtime behaviors. As coded from observational assessments, parents increased their use of positive parenting practices. Telehealth-delivered PCIT-Health is a promising treatment modality for increasing parenting skills and improving child behavior. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The stigma and negative attitudes surrounding Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are reinforced by the prevalence of their negative representations. This study aimed to determine how AD framing influences attitudes towards AD and whether this influence differs between younger and older people. Additionally, the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) was used to examine the mediating role that emotions induced by different frames may have in bringing about attitude change. Posters with framed messages on AD (dualism and unity) were designed and shown to 136 participants (68 younger and 68 older adults). Both the younger and older participants were randomly divided into two sub-groups. Each sub-group was shown posters of a campaign with different AD frames: one group viewed posters with messages of the dualism frame and the other group viewed posters with messages of the unity frame. To analyse the effect of the different frames, a mixed design of repeated measures (ANOVA) was used in which attitudes towards AD were measured on two occasions. Both the impact and the emotions produced by exposure to the messages were recorded after the presentation of the posters and a MANOVA test was performed on them. Attitudes, impact and emotions experienced by the younger and older participants were compared. Older adults displayed positive attitudes towards AD but less than younger people. Unity-framed messages produced a positive change in attitudes regardless of the audience’s age and led to higher levels of happiness, whereas dualism-framed messages had a greater impact and produced feelings of sadness, anger and fear but did not change attitudes. These findings suggest that reframing of AD may be essential to achieve a positive attitudinal change in both younger and older populations and foster positive emotions. The use of unity-framed messages should be considered when developing and implementing policies targeted at communication and awareness of AD in order to reduce the stigma associated with this form of dementia. © 2022 Cuadrado et al.

AB  - Objective The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Design Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the school closures and implementation of lockdown and social distancing. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6 and 16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric or chronic disorder. Analysis Data were collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years (IQR=4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Children's Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, † c =-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels. Conclusion A large proportion of children had elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, suggesting a need for measures to engage children in healthy habits to protect children's mental health and continuous monitoring of children during such scenarios. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The present research examines psychological concomitants of support for anti-abortion laws in Poland in the wake of the Constitutional Tribunal’s 2020 ruling restricting access to abortion in cases of fetal malformations. Results of two cross-sectional studies conducted on representative samples of Poles (Study 1, N = 994 and Study 2, N = 432) indicated that support for an almost total abortion ban was associated with national narcissism – a belief in the national in-group’s greatness that is contingent on its external validation. In both studies, the relationship between national narcissism and support for anti-abortion laws was mediated by hostile, but not benevolent, sexism. Study 2 additionally showed that this effect remained significant even when we accounted for other important variables, such as individual narcissism or prejudice towards people with Down syndrome. Overall, our results indicate that national narcissism may play an important role in shaping anti-abortion attitudes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - (1) Background: Children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable to malaria infection, and they suffer serious complications. Sierra Leone is one of the countries with the highest malaria burden in the world. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) toward malaria control and prevention among caregivers of children under 5 in the Western Area of Sierra Leone. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among caregivers of children under-5 visiting the out-patient department of six selected hospitals/community health centers. Data were collected via questionnaire interviews with 350 caregivers. (3) Results: A total of 97.1% of the respondents were women and the majority of them were young mothers; 46.3% of respondents were unemployed; and 27.1% received no education. Only 1.4% accessed malaria related information from the internet/social media. This KAPs survey indicated that a misconception of the cause, transmission, and clinical symptoms of malaria; unawareness of its lethality and its severity; and inappropriate prevention and treatment behaviors, such as self-medicating, were still in existence among some caregivers. However, a positive correlation in knowledge–attitudes (rs = 0.13, p &lt; 0.05) and in attitudes–practices (rs = 0.45, p &lt; 0.001) was revealed. The caregivers, being mothers and having at least a secondary education, demonstrated positive attitudes and practices. Meanwhile, more urban caregivers (79.8%) followed a complete malaria treatment course of artemisinin-based combination therapies than the rural (63.3%), but in view of insecticide treated net use, more rural caregivers presented positive attitudes (85.3%) and practices (70.1%) than the urban (69.9%, 52.0%). (4) Conclusions: For better protection of children under-5 against lethal malaria, it is essential to provide better guidance at the community level for their caregivers, especially young mothers, in order to reduce some misconceptions and inappropriate behaviors. An increase in education and employment opportunities for women, establishment of an accessible community-based malaria counselling service, and construction of an effective communication channel are also needed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Technologies offered and used on the Internet play a significant part in the lives of children; nevertheless, little research has been done on how children view and use machine translation (MT). According to recent literature, there are various benefits to using MT in teaching/learning foreign languages, such as more fluent writing, more effective communication, and fewer errors. Nevertheless, the use of MT in classroom settings is often viewed as problematic by language teachers. Despite the fact that a vast number of students have used MT for various purposes or have tried experimenting with MT for certain academic or entertainment purposes, they seem to have mixed feelings about it. The present qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews and aims to capture a snapshot of Lithuanian children’s perceptions and awareness of MT technologies. The results of the interviews reveal that children mostly find out about MT as a result of their own efforts and employ MT tools for a variety of purposes; however, at school no systematic guidance and/or support in terms of MT use is provided and children tend to perceive that their teachers generally hold negative attitudes towards MT. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Tuberculosis remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Equatorial Guinea, with an estimated incidence of 280 per 100,000 inhabitants, an estimated mortality rate of 96 per 100,000 inhabitants, and a treatment non-adherence rate of 21.4%. This study aimed to identify the factors associated to TB-related knowledge, attitudes, and stigma in order to design community intervention strategies that could improve TB diagnostic and treatment adherence in Equatorial Guinea. A nationwide cross-sectional survey of 770 household caregivers was conducted in Equatorial Guinea about TB knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Knowledge, attitude, and stigma scores were calculated through correct answers and the median was used as cut-off. Associated factors were analyzed calculating prevalence ratio (PR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) through Poisson regression with robust variance. The percentage of women was 53.0% and median age was 46 years (IQR: 33–60). The percentage of caregivers with high TB related knowledge was 34.9%, with a bad attitude (52.5%) and low stigma (40.4%). A greater probability of having good knowledge was observed in those 45 years old or less (PR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.6), those with higher education level (PR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1–1.8) and higher wealth (PR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–2.0), while sex (PR = 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6–0.9), religion (PR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0–1.8), and good knowledge (PR = 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2–1.7) were associated with good attitudes. Wage employment (PR = 95% CI: 1.2–1.4), feeling well informed (PR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.6–0.8), having good TB knowledge (PR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7), and some sources of information were associated with having lower TB-related stigma. This study found that a high percentage of caregivers in Equatorial Guinea lack important knowledge about TB disease and have bad attitudes and high TB-related stigma. Given the epidemiological situation of TB in the country, it is urgent to improve TB knowledge and awareness among Equatorial Guinea’s general population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Critical consciousness development represents a building block in the formation of health-related attitudes and behaviours. One of the most studied health-related behaviours in the previous year is COVID-19 vaccination behaviour. The present study examines critical consciousness, COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and vaccination behaviour in a consistent sample of young adults (N = 1185). Participants were residents of Romania, aged 18 to 41 years. The Critical Consciousness Scale—Short Form (CCS-S) and the Vaccination Attitudes Examination (VAX) Scale were used. The results demonstrate the mediating role of two types of vaccination attitude—lack of confidence in the promoted vaccine benefits and worries about unforeseen effects—in the relationship between critical reflection and vaccination behaviour. Communication is fundamental in an initiative aimed at changing behaviour. When shaping a health-related campaign, communication and dialogue must be horizontal and characterised by empathy and mutual recognition to determine favourable health-related behaviour. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Previous studies on the human likeness of service robots have focused mainly on their human-like appearance and used psychological constructs to measure the outcomes of human like-ness. Unlike previous studies, this study focused on the human-like behavior of the service robot and used a sociological construct, social distance, to measure the outcome of human likeness. We constructed a conceptual model, with perceived competence and warmth as mediators, based on social-identity theory. The hypotheses were tested through online experiments with 219 participants from China and 180 participants from the US. Similar results emerged for Chinese and American participants in that the high (vs. low) human-like behavior of the service robot caused the participants to have stronger perceptions of competence and warmth, both of which contributed to a smaller social distance between humans and service robots. Perceptions of competence and warmth completely mediated the positive effect of the human-like behavior of the service robot on social distance. Fur-thermore, Chinese participants showed higher anthropomorphism (perceived human-like behavior) and a stronger perception of warmth and smaller social distance. The perception of competence did not differ across cultures. This study provides suggestions for the human-likeness design of service robots to promote natural interaction between humans and service robots and increase human acceptance of service robots. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Cancer patients, being immunocompromised, are at higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current study determines cancer patients’ knowledge, attitude, perception, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Pakistan from 1 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. The study respondents were cancer patients with ages equal to or greater than 18 years. Following a request for participation, the URL for the survey was distributed on numerous channels. Other social media platforms, including WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, and LinkedIn, were used to increase cancer patient interaction. The questionnaire comprised five different sections such as: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception, and (5) impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Descriptive medical statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to illustrate the demographic characteristics of the study participants. To compare mean knowledge scores with selected demographic variables, independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used, which are also practical methods in epidemiological, public health and medical research. The cut-off point for statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05. Results: More than 300 cancer patients were invited, of which 208 agreed to take part. The response rate was 69.33% (208/300). Gender, marital status, and employment status had a significant association with knowledge scores. Of the total recruited participants, 96% (n = 200) (p < 0.01) knew about COVID-19, and 90% were aware of general symptoms of COVID-19 disease, such as route of transmission and preventive measurements. In total, 94.5% (n = 197) (p < 0.01) were willing to accept isolation if they were infected with COVID-19, and 98% (n = 204) (p < 0.01) had reduced their use of public transportation. More than 90% (n = 188) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients were found to be practicing preventative measures such as using a face mask, keeping social distance, and avoiding handshaking and hugging. Around 94.4% (n = 196) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients had been impacted by, stopped or had. changed cancer treatment during this pandemic, resulting in COVID-related anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The included cancer patients exhibited a good level of COVID-19 knowledge, awareness, positive attitude, and perception. Large-scale studies and efforts are needed to raise COVID-19 awareness among less educated and high-risk populations. The present survey indicates that mass-level effective health education initiatives are required for developing countries to improve and reduce the gap between KAP and COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To identify the status of knowledge, attitude, and behaviour toward evidence-based practice (EBP) among Chinese psychiatric nurses, and to examine the influencing factors of EBP behaviour. Methods: We utilised a cross-sectional design. A total of 923 psychiatric nurses from 168 hospitals in 27 provinces in the mainland of China participated in our survey. The EBP questionnaire, the barriers to research utilisation scale and the facilitators to research utilisation scale were used for data collection via WeChat group from July 2018 to April 2019. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the influencing factors of psychiatric nurses’ evidence-based practice behaviour. Results: The score of Chinese psychiatric nurses’ EBP attitude, behaviour and knowledge were 4.81 ± 1.34, 4.11 ± 1.36 and 3.53 ± 1.29, respectively. Multiple regression analysis showed that nurses’ EBP behaviour was mainly determined by knowledge and attitude, which together explained 61.8% of the variance. The two top barriers were the dimensions of presentation and research. Facilitators include managerial support, employing nurses with research skills as models and providing advanced education on evidence-based nursing. Conclusion: Psychiatric nurses have positive attitudes toward EBP, but their level of knowledge and behaviour is insufficient. Heavy workload, insufficient time, and a lack of knowledge and skills is the main barrier. Managerial support, employing nurses with research skills as models and providing advanced education are the main facilitators. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Social distancing measures against COVID-19 imposed restrictions on students that may have affected their physical health and fitness. The objective of this study was to investigate the change in physical fitness of primary school students across the coronavirus outbreaks from 2019 to 2021. This was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. We obtained the annual physical and fitness assessment data measured every November for all students at the same primary school in Guangzhou, China. There was a total of 6371 observations in the dataset for three years. The physical fitness of the students was evaluated with an overall physical fitness score, body mass index (BMI), lung vital capacity, physical flexibility (via a sit-and-reach test) and sports task performances (sprint, shuttle run, rope-jumping, and sit-up). Generalised estimating equations were used to determine any significant changes from 2019 to 2021, adjusted for confounders. After the COVID-19 outbreak in 2021, there was a significant elevation in BMI of 0.64 kg/m2 in 2020 and 0.39 kg/m2 in 2021 (p &lt; 0.001). The overall physical fitness score was significantly increased by 2.1 and 4.1 points, respectively, in 2020 and 2021 (p &lt; 0.001). Lung vital capacity and rope-jumping performance were significantly improved in both 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019, and sit-up performance was marginally significantly improved in 2020 and significantly improved in 2021. However, students demonstrated poorer flexibility and sprint and shuttle run performance in 2021 compared with 2019. A health promotion programme during and after COVID-19, including online physical education classes, television broadcasts, and a rope-jumping campaign, could account for these positive outcomes, along with the ease of administering rope-jumping and sit-ups at home. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to spread rapidly worldwide, forcing countries to enact lockdowns and strict social-distancing measures that affect individual and population health. This study investigates the changes in dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors among Saudi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 786 participants, with a mean age of 30 years. The questionnaire was administered online and sent via social media applications. Dietary habits, physical activity, TV-watching time, sleep patterns, stressors, and socio-demographic data were evaluated. Among the survey respondents, there was an increase in weight gain, food consumption, and decreased physical activity. Respondents who gained weight consumed more snacks, ate larger food portions, and engaged in less physical activity. Furthermore, a high fish, water, and supplements intake was noticed. Although respondents’ intake of fruits and vegetables was low, most individuals reported a negatively changed intake. However, most respondents reported increased consumption of lean meat and sweet foods. Observing changes in dietary and lifestyle habits during the lockdown period may help elaborate on the pandemic’s consequences for population health and assist in formulating and implementing policies for future closures, while supporting vulnerable groups. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Risk assessment and response is important for understanding human behavior. The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political “Left” diverge from those on the “Right”). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Method: Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Results: Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Conclusions: Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived “common ground,” between the political “Right” and “Left.” Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is known for facilitating interpersonal interactions in favorable conditions. Humor, on the other hand, is an interpersonal phenomenon that reduces social distance. In this study, we investigated whether OT would increase laughing and smiling in a favorable environment. Therefore, participants were asked to view a brief video clip of a comedy television program in the presence of an ingroup member after administration of either OT or a placebo. Results demonstrated that participants in the OT condition exhibited more laughing and smiling behavior over the course of viewing the video compared to participants in the placebo condition. OT, however, neither affected self-reported affect nor perceived funniness of the clip. These findings indicate that OT, a hormone that can bolster attachment, also has the power to facilitate implicit social interactions by promoting visible and audible social signals, but does not affect the socially irrelevant inner cheerfulness. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examines the effects of self-generated and other-generated electronic word-of-mouth communication (eWOM) in inoculating individuals against potential misinformation. A three-phase between-subject experiment (N = 543) was conducted to compare the persuasive effects of inoculation messages combined with different eWOM content (self-generated, other-generated, and inoculation only) over two health topics (Covid-19 vaccine and e-cigarette). The results show that exposure to inoculation messages did not significantly increase resistance to misinformation. But inoculation messages combined with other-generated eWOM helped the participants develop more negative attitudes toward alternative smoking immediately after exposure to the inoculation stimuli. The participants who wrote eWOM after exposure to inoculation messages were more resistant to the attack of misinformation in Phase 3. Self-generated and other-generated eWOM did not significantly differ in their persuasive effects in any phases. The findings extend the literature on the effects of WOM in the inoculation process and offer theoretical implications over inoculation theory in online contexts. The study provides empirical guidance on using inoculation messages to combat misinformation in social media. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study argues that research on advergames needs to better address the relationships between players’ psychological characteristics and their behavioural responses. In this article, we present a theoretical model that explains the antecedents and consequences of players’ transportation experience to have positive advergame outcomes. Our model demonstrates that three key psychological traits (sensation seeking, transportability and perceived interactivity) foster positive attitudes towards the featured brand in an advergame and intention to replay the game. The results also reveal that transportability is the most influential factor than others. Then, we show a mediation effect of transportation in the association between the psychological traits and desired advergame outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2022 Mudra Institute of Communications, Ahmedabad, India.

AB  - Objectives: In the COVID-19 era, extreme measures of social distancing have contained the spread of common viral respiratory infections, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy (ATH), and Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion (COME), the two commonest chronic ENT diseases of childhood. This study examines the lockdown effect on the number of procedures performed for these two conditions. Methods: The consecutive charts of 650 and 195 children being operated respectively for ATH and COME during the quarantine (05/2020-02/2021) and unrestrained (05/2019-02/2020) periods were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical treatment of ankyloglossia, performed in 103 patients during the same periods was employed as a control procedure. Results: Adenotonsillectomies and tympanostomies significantly decreased in the lockdown phase by 52% (P < 0.001) and 74% (P < 0.001), respectively, whereas control procedure counts increased by 25%. In terms of seasonal variation, ATH-related surgeries were significantly reduced during the winter season of the pandemic by 73% (P < 0.001), in comparison with the corresponding months of the unrestrained period. School-aged children received significantly fewer operations for ATH (−59%) than preschoolers (−42%), as a result of the lockdown (P = 0.044). Conclusion: When the child's exposure to respiratory pathogens is minimal, as in the case of lockdown, a noticeable decline occurs in the incidence of ATH and COME indicated for surgical treatment. Chronic low-grade inflammation, boosted by repetitive viral infections seems to underlie both conditions. Timely, effective isolation measures might reverse the disease process and keep the child away from the Operating Room. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Despite the recognised importance of public acceptance for the success of industrial technologies, little is known about public attitudes towards chemical recycling. We address this gap by investigating the nature of public attitudes towards gasification. Gasification, a form of chemical recycling, can be used to convert carbonaceous wastes into feedstocks that can be used to produce a variety of products (e.g., plastics and transportation fuels) and is seen as a means of supporting the transition towards a circular carbon economy. Using an online questionnaire distributed to diverse samples of the public in Germany (n = 318) and the UK (n = 327), we assessed participants' attitudes towards gasification after exposure to a short informative video about either coal- or waste-based gasification. These countries were selected as both have advanced chemical recycling industries, but also evidence historic differences in public perceptions of carbon-related technologies. Results show that initial self-reported awareness and knowledge of gasification were very low, although improved by the video. Participants in both countries were generally positive about gasification, particularly waste-based gasification. Mediation analysis indicated that this preference was explained by a stronger positive and weaker negative affective response to the technology, as well as a stronger belief that waste-based gasification is a ‘green’ technology option that was worthy of investment. Trust in developers was identified as a direct predictor of attitudes towards gasification. The study complements the ongoing techno-economic-ecological evaluations of gasification technologies and has implications for the development of public engagement and communication efforts. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is a disabling mental illness. Antipsychotic treatment in conjunction with comprehensive psychosocial rehabilitation services is essential in promoting functional recovery. Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) is an evidence-based approach in promoting recovery in schizophrenia. The evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of such community-based assertive interventions in low and middle-income countries is limited. Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of modified assertive community treatment in a South Indian setting and evaluate the perspectives of patients and caregivers who participated in the program. Methodology: Socio-demographic details, illness characteristics, course of the illness including the number of relapses and hospitalization, adherence level at baseline, the scores on the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), and Global disability score on Indian Disability Evaluation and Assessment Scale (IDEAS) were compared before and after the initiation of the M-CAT program using retrospective file review. The perspectives of the clients were assessed using a 6-item questionnaire. Results: Ten patients (six male and four female) with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were under the Manipal Assertive Community Treatment (M-ACT) program for a median duration of 3 years (IQR 1.25) participated in the study. There was a significant improvement in the overall level of functioning, medication adherence, relapse rates, and disability after the enrolment into the program. The majority of the respondents had a positive attitude towards the M-ACT program. Conclusion: Assertive community interventions with suitable modifications for local resource-limited conditions may be an effective option in promoting functional recovery in Schizophrenia. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an “intervention tournament” which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (N = 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19—including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidence—were implemented to identify which framings would “win” in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19. © 2022

AB  - The discrepancy between ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility is well established in social psychology. Under which conditions does “ingroup love” turn into “outgroup hate”? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. In two preregistered experiments, we test the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We use the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). The preliminary findings suggest that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism, more weak parochialism, more universal cooperation, and less strong parochialism. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between “ingroup love” and “outgroup hate”. The third and final preregistered study aims to replicate these findings in a different cultural setting and test the mediating role of trust in this process. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new risks and stress for paid transport users worldwide. COVID-19 has changed mobility dynamics worldwide, including low- and middle-income countries (e.g., Vietnam). The present study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of ride-sourcing passengers' behavioural intentions when COVID-19 pandemic management successfully prevented community transmission by extending the TPB with two constructs: perceived virus infection risk and problem-focused coping. Using self-administered questionnaires, data were collected from ride-sourcing customers in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). A total of 540 responses were used for validating the proposed theorethical model. The structural equation model results indicate that problem-focused coping is a multi-faceted construct with two dimensions: problem-solving and self-protection. Also, problem-focused coping has the highest total effect on the intention to use ride-sourcing services following a period of COVID-19 suppression (3 months without identified cases). The findings also reveal that attitude partially mediates the link between problem-focused coping and behavioural intention. The results of this study could be used to develop strategies to promote ride-sourcing services in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Owing to strict access control implemented on university campuses during COVID-19, college students experienced increased isolation, resulting in several physical and mental health issues. This study investigates the relationships among perceived built environment, walking attitudes, walking behavior, physical and mental state, and the impact of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students (N = 429) at Dalian University of Technology, China, on September 20 (Sunday) and 21 (Monday), 2020. The survey questionnaire included questions related to socio-demographic factors, perceived environment (accessibility, road condition and safety, and aesthetics), walking attitudes, walking behavior (number of walking trips), physical and mental state, and the impact of pandemic. Subsequently, two structural equation models (SEMs) were developed to analyze the proposed conceptual framework. The empirical results indicated that the SEMs fit the data well, thereby validating the conceptual framework. Perceived environment (especially accessibility), attitudes, and walking behavior significantly influenced physical and mental state. Perceived environment mediated the effects between attitudes and walking behavior and physical and mental state. The pandemic negatively impacted attitudes and physical and mental state. The effect of perceived accessibility on walking behavior and that of walking behavior on physical and mental state were stronger on weekends, whereas the effects of attitudes and the pandemic on physical and mental state were stronger on weekdays. The findings indicate that universities should implement appropriate strategies to improve the objective and subjective built environment, especially accessibility, and cultivate positive attitudes among students to promote walking and improve physical and mental health during COVID-19. © 2022 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies

AB  - Social media influencers promote not only products and brands but also their opinions on serious topics like party politics or climate change. These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers’ political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers’ communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (NT2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (NT2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers’ content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers’ communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest—yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Bias is an inclination or preconceived outlook that favors toward or against an idea, person, or group. It manifests in implicit and explicit ways throughout all aspects and institutions of society. These cognitive shortcuts are often based on stereotypes and can lead to prejudice and discrimination in medicine as they mediate interactions with patients, between providers, and at the institutional level. It is important to understand the drivers and consequences of bias in order to overcome barriers to representation, equity, and inclusion. This paper provides definitions of bias; discusses its manifestations across academic medicine at the institutional and individual levels; and concludes by examining techniques to reduce bias and measure progress. Equity for patients, families, and members of the broader surgical community cannot be achieved without reducing bias and discrimination. We call for action to increase intentional efforts that reduce the influences of bias in healthcare, research, and education, particularly in the field of pediatric surgery. © 2022

AB  - Plastic pollution is widespread globally, and consumers play a crucial role in reducing the pollution produced by plastic waste. Although many studies have analyzed and estimated the intentions or behavior of recycling, relatively few studies have specifically focused on plastic. Moreover, we have little understanding of how technology (e.g., social media) has changed and can change consumer behavior related to plastic pollution. Therefore, this study expands our comprehension of which factors interact with consumers' behavior and intention to recycle plastics, extending knowledge of the influence of social media on consumer behavior. Through two analyses conducted on a sample of four hundred and sixty-seven American consumers, we reveal that attitudes, followed by perceived control and peer influence, positively impact consumers' intentions to recycle plastic. However, the influence of social media turns out to be significant only when examined on the cluster of consumers exposed to plastic recycling-themed content on their social media feeds. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that intentions are a crucial underlying determinant in the manifestation of plastic recycling behavior (Direct Behavior) and support for diffusion through political and administrative interventions (Indirect Behavior). Finally, the parametric and PLS-MGA tests show a significant difference in the influence of social media on demographic clusters. Thus, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for plastic recycling frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and Aim: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted human lives across the world. In a country like India, with the second highest population in the world, impact of COVID-19 has been diverse and multidimensional. Under such circumstances, vaccination against COVID-19 infection is claimed to be one of the major solutions to contain the pandemic. Understanding of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) measures are essential prerequisites to design suitable intervention programs. This paper examines the different KAP factors in Indians towards their decision of vaccine uptake. Method: An online questionnaire was administered to Indian respondents. (Pilot study: n = 100, Main study: n = 221) to assess their existing knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination, attitude and intentions towards COVID-19 vaccines and their decision towards COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Result: The findings highlighted that existing knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination directly impacted their attitude and intention towards vaccination. The attitude and intention towards COVID-19 vaccines directly impacted their practice of undergoing COVID-19 vaccination. Further, there was a statistically significant and considerably large indirect effect of existing knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination on the practice of undergoing COVID-19 vaccination through attitude and intention towards the vaccine. There was no direct effect of Knowledge (existing knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination) on Practice (decision to undergo COVID-19 vaccination). Therefore, Attitude and intention towards COVID-19 vaccine is the primary mediator between Knowledge (existing knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination) and Practice (decision to undergo COVID-19 vaccination). Conclusion: Participants decision towards COVID-19 vaccination decisions are strongly related to their attitude and intentions that confirms the strong role of attitude towards success of COVID-19 vaccination programme. Therefore, ‘person-centric’ attitude based positive intervention strategies that links their prior knowledge on COVID-19 infections and vaccination must be designed for greater vaccine acceptance amongst Indians. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Research investigating the early emergence of racial prejudice has been largely limited to contexts in which racial prejudice is most likely to emerge—multiracial societies that have pronounced racial inequality (e.g., United States, South Africa). The present study assessed whether pro-White racial bias is also early emerging in a homogenous Black community that has little exposure to modern media and where children presumably experience less overt discrimination than in past samples. Black African children (N = 214) between 5- and 12-years-old living in rural Uganda exhibited substantial pro-White racial bias, preferring White over Black children 78% of the time. Ugandan children also judged White children as higher status than Black children, and these status judgments predicted their degree of pro-White bias. Our results indicate that pro-White racial biases can emerge even in a homogenous Black community and that, in some contexts, minimal status cues can be sufficient for the early development of racial prejudice. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, restrictions, and social distancing requirements for medical offices reduced scheduling availability and increased virtual televisits by providers. COVID-19 restrictions created a barrier to health care access for patients who are being administered long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in an already vulnerable population. Objective: To describe an LAI medication administration service at a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate patient satisfaction with the administration of LAIs by a pharmacist service in a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare the patient's perceptions of receiving LAIs in a community-based pharmacy with those in another setting previously used for medication administration. Practice description: Independent full-service community-based pharmacy. Practice innovation: Implementation of an LAI administration service after an increase in provider referrals of patients to the community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation methods: A 4-month prospective convenience sample study conducted to evaluate the LAI medication administration service. The survey containing 32 questions was adapted with permission from a previous survey administered in a large grocery store chain to a similar population. Survey results were reported using descriptive statistics. Results: Eleven patients completed the survey. A total of 82% of patients strongly agreed that they felt comfortable with receiving this service at the community-based pharmacy and were satisfied with the privacy during the service. Seventy-one percent of patients who received this service elsewhere strongly agreed the LAI medication administration service was more convenient than a similar service received elsewhere, yet only 18% of patients strongly agreed that the community-based pharmacy was near their work or home. Conclusion: A medication administration service for LAIs was developed in a community-based pharmacy, and patients were satisfied with the service. Further research needs to be completed to evaluate health outcomes and financial implications of this service for the patient and health care system. © 2022 American Pharmacists Association®

AB  - The demand for using library apps to search for information has been increasing after the COVID-19 outbreak. To look into how the pandemic affects the users’ perception of the loyalty of using library apps, we designed this research by amalgamating the updated IS success model and S–O-R model to evaluate the service quality of a public library app under the Hong Kong Government mobile applications initiative. A third-order model is established to demonstrate the multi-faceted aspects of service quality and mediating effects of perceived brand image, satisfaction, and e-word of mouth. Using structural equation modeling, data collected from Hong Kong, a metropolis where mobile services empower its citizens, showed the interrelationships among service quality and possible outcomes (i.e., perceived brand image, user satisfaction, e-word of mouth, and user loyalty). Findings also indicate that the influence of perceived service quality on user loyalty could only be achieved through perceived brand image and user satisfaction. This is a timely study during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown and social distancing arrangements created challenges for citizens to search for information in public libraries in person. Our findings and suggestions reiterate the importance of considering the usability concepts when analyzing the service quality of each unique app. They also provide insights for practitioners in developing the next generation of apps for smart public information services and call for further investigation into the proposed hierarchical model and other potential factors related to service quality. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In early 2020, the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began to shake the world. As the resulting pandemic, quickly dubbed COVID-19, unfolded, we learned to enact public health safety measures to reduce or prevent its spread, particularly “social distancing,” an expression once alien but now understood all too well. Consequently, many sought online resources when they would have previously accessed them in person. We have used Facebook Live for several years to discuss radiology topics and, on occasion, interview experts in the medical field and beyond. Much like live television, Facebook Live enables creators like us to share videos with followers in real time. Unlike live television, Facebook Live allows viewers to leave comments and questions in real time, rendering the platform much more interactive. Because Facebook Live has been a helpful tool for us to speak to radiology students and professionals around the world, we looked for another way to continue our interviews on Facebook Live while maintaining social distancing. We have managed to continue our interviews while socially distanced using the video communications software Zoom. With an increasing number of people migrating to online technology, the widespread use of social media for radiology education is imminent. We encourage others to consider mixing Facebook Live and Zoom to create more holistic educational experiences for radiology in the digital world. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that life can change unexpectedly and quickly, but online education is here to stay. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The study compared the level of physical activity (PA) between older people living with HIV (PLWH) and their HIV-negative counterparts in China and tested the mediational roles of self-compassion, attitudes toward aging, and perceived stress in the between-group difference in PA. From December 2017 to August 2018, face-to-face interviews were conducted among 337 and 363 HIV-positive and –negative people aged ≥ 50 in Yongzhou City, Hunan, China. Path analysis was performed. The proportions of low, moderate, and high levels of PA in the HIV-positive and -negative groups were 18.9% versus 6.7%, 43.1% versus 32.0%, and 38.0% versus 61.3%, respectively, yielding a statistically significant difference. The path analysis showed that older PLWH reported less self-compassion and positive attitudes toward aging, which was in turn associated with more perceived stress and ultimately associated with less PA. Chinese older PLWH were more sedentary than their HIV-negative counterparts. Future PA interventions may modify the mediators. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: Based on the arguments of conservation of resource theory (COR), this study aims to investigate the mechanism underlying the linkage of COVID fear, work-family conflict (W-FC) and family-work conflict (F-WC) while investigating the mediating role of COVID stress and social distancing. The study also tests the moderating role of religiosity in these relationships. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 401 survey responses from doctors and university teachers are collected through online and personally administrated questionnaires. Partial least square-based structural equation modeling technique is applied using Smart PLS software. Findings: This study finds that COVID fear has a positive and significant impact on COVID stress and social distancing while religiosity negatively impacts COVID fear. Further, COVID stress and social distancing mediates the relationships between COVID fear and W-FC/ F-WC. However, the study found that COVID stress is a more effective mechanism as compared to social distancing in explaining the mediation process. It is also found that religiosity significantly moderates the nexus between COVID stress and both W-FC and F-WC negatively. Practical implications: Findings imply that the teachers, as well as doctors, must be immediately be provided with the proper facilitation to maintain their work from home operations with the best of the institutional facilities. Moreover, the recruitment policy in such professions can also consider religious practices to be the indicators of problem-solving and stress management in such a challenging context. Originality/value: This study provides timely and novel insight into the interplay between the domains of work and family during the period of stressful COVID outbreak. By distinguishing W-FC and F-WC, it provides a detailed understanding of the process during the COVID period. The groundbreaking finding in the research is with the moderation of religiosity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Online contexts are becoming a widely available space to disseminate health information and target specific populations for health campaigns. Limited evidence for health message engagement in these contexts exists. This study draws on the elaboration likelihood model and construal-level theory to predict processing time and recall when individuals are presented with messages for or against electronic cigarette use from socially close or distant sources. Participants (N = 159) were shown messages about electronic cigarettes, designed to look like tweets, from socially close and socially distant message senders. Processing times were highest for pro-attitudinal messages while messages from socially close sources were more likely to be recalled, and furthering social distance increased the difference in processing times for pro- and counter-attitudinal messages. We demonstrate the applicability of behavioral measures in online studies, while finding that attitudes, social distance, and their interaction affect measures of message processing. These findings suggest further exploration may be needed to differentiate between processing time and counterarguing. From our findings, we offer applied practitioners guidance on how to develop messages that target audiences will spend more time considering and are more likely to remember. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - Purpose: Identify the elements (defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors) of the diagnoses of NANDA international impaired religiosity (00169), risk for impaired religiosity (00170), and readiness for enhanced religiosity (00171), in a period of social distancing in the pandemic of COVID-19, and associate them with the behavior of individual and collective religious practice, before and during the pandemic. Methods: Survey study, released via social media to members of religious communities in Brazil. Data collection took place in June 2020, by online questionnaire. Findings: Participants were 719 people, 563 (78.3%) were women, with a median age of 39 years (min 18–max 73), of Catholic religion (64.7%), with a median of 29 years of religious practice (min 0–max 70). The participants were from Southeast 652 (90.68%), South 49 (6.82%), Northeast 13 (1.82%), Midwest 4 (0.56%), and North 01 (0.14%) of Brazil. The increase of individual religious practice was associated with two diagnostic elements and the reduction of individual practice to nine elements. The reduction of collective religious practice was associated with seven diagnostic elements and the maintenance of the practice associated with five elements. The increase of collective religious practice was associated with five diagnostic elements. Conclusions: In individuals who presented during the pandemic reduction of individual religious practice, reduction of collective religious practice, and maintenance of collective religious practice, the elements of the diagnosis impaired religiosity were predominant. In individuals who presented increased practice of collective religious activity during the pandemic, the elements of the diagnosis readiness for enhanced religiosity were predominant. Implications for nursing practice: This study highlights defining characteristics, risk factors, and related factors of the religiosity diagnoses presented due to social distancing in the pandemic; these should be screened during nursing consultations in primary health care. © 2021 NANDA International, Inc.

AB  - This article addresses the participation of celebrities and their fans in media controversies. As techno-social events, controversies are constitutive of discursive battles, between numerically conscious participatory communities, aimed at describing the meaning and significance of cultural symbols. Celebrities, in their capacity as cultural symbols, provide the ground for staging these discursive battles. Fan participation, as auxiliary of celebrity participation, is studied here specifically to discern its essential functions vis-a-vis controversies. For elaborating its argument, this article looks at Shah Rukh Khan (hereafter SRK) and his fandom in India. SRK, as a transcultural symbol of Liberal Islam, was embroiled in media controversies wherein the meaning and significance of his ‘Muslimness’ was debated and scrutinised. Marked by struggles between SRK fandom, on one side, and right-wing/reactionary groups on the other, these controversies testify SRK’s centrality in political debates surrounding the ‘Muslim Question’ in Indian Polity. This article argues that SRK Fandom’s primary discursive function is to create an ‘Eulogistic Buffer’ that insulates SRK from right-wing/reactionary islamophobia. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Issue addressed: News reports linking mental illness to violent crime are among the most stigmatising portrayals. These portrayals can perpetuate stereotypes of dangerousness, negatively influencing public attitudes and having a harmful impact on people with lived experience of mental illness. With the aim of improving the quality of news portrayals and mitigating harm, best-practice guidelines for media reporting on mental illness, violence and crime have been developed. To increase understanding of the guidelines’ content, a 1-hour workshop based on the main principles was developed for journalism students. Methods: In this study, the workshop was piloted with a pre and 3-week follow-up evaluation with a cohort of journalism students (n = 29). Results: Three weeks after the workshop, there were significant improvements in attitudes towards severe mental illness, knowledge of best-practice reporting, intentions and confidence to report consistently with the best-practice guidelines and performance on an editing task designed to assess adherence to the guidelines. Belief in dangerousness/unpredictability reduced markedly, demonstrating that the workshop effectively addressed misinformation about people with severe mental illness being a risk to the public. Conclusions: This pilot trial provides promising initial results and provides a basis for wider implementation and evaluation of media training on this topic. So what: Improved understanding of best-practice media guidelines, as generated through this workshop, has potential to reduce stigmatising news reporting on people with mental illness, and consequently reduce public stigma. © 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.

AB  - Our concern in this contribution is to ask what the special features of populism in Hungary are, where government and the largest opposition party can be considered populist. The study aims at analyzing motivations, interests, benefits, and profits of populism in fragile Hungarian regions. The main part examines three peculiar features of state populism: the rural support for stabile political and social structures; early-born conservative social policy, which freezes and preserves social inequalities and pacificates social conflicts; and selective social policy that has made a strong difference between “worthy” and “unworthy” poor, thus, contributing to ethnic-based conflicts and emerging prejudice. The Hungarian case shows that poverty and social inequalities, disintegration, hierarchical local power structure with dominance of economic–political oligarchy, weak participation, monopolization of local and non-local media, and racialization of poverty are enabling factors of populism. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The treatment of the mentally ill people is a challenge across the world, and different professionals, such as doctors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses, take care of this group. Nonetheless, mental health is not a vocational sector preferred by students and professionals of many of these careers. Research has proposed that professional preference for a patient group would be positively influenced by intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and empathy (perspective-taking), and negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and social distance. However, the evidence testing this proposal was partial and mainly referring to other patient groups such as minorities or immigrants. The major aim of this cross-sectional study was to clarify two research questions referring to mentally ill persons: Do contact and empathy protect undergraduates from intergroup anxiety and social distance and promote professional preference? Do intergroup anxiety and social distance predict professional preference and mediate the influence of contact and empathy in professional preference? A convenience sample of 409 Social Work undergraduates (81% females) from three Spanish universities completed a questionnaire between February and June 2020. Concerning direct relationships, the structural equation model showed that the quantity of contact only predicted intergroup anxiety negatively; quality of contact and empathy negatively predicted intergroup anxiety and social distance; intergroup anxiety positively predicted social distance; intergroup anxiety and social distance negatively predicted professional preference. Concerning mediated relationships, the influence of quality of contact and empathy on social distance was mediated by intergroup anxiety; social distance mediated the relationship of intergroup anxiety with professional preference; both anxiety and distance mediated the influence of quality of contact and empathy in professional preference. These results encourage interventions aimed at enhancing professional preference for mental illness by improving contact, knowledge, and empathy and reducing stigma in students and workers from diverse mental health careers. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Young adulthood is a major and significant stage in life encompassing various life transitions which may increase the risk of developing emotional crises. Receiving mental health treatment and turning to nonprofessional resources for support can ease such emotional burdens. However, many of those in need of such help do not turn to professional services and, rather, tend to rely on themselves. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma, anticipated risk, anticipated utility, and social support to the intention to seek professional and nonprofessional emotional help among Jewish young adults in Israel. Participants included 282 Jewish Israeli young adults aged 18–30, recruited in person or online. They filled out a self-report questionnaire, between March and June 2017, regarding intention to seek professional and non-professional emotional help, attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma towards seeking professional emotional help, anticipated risk and anticipated utility of self-disclosure when seeking professional help, perceived social support and sociodemographic questions. A path analysis model was used to analyse the data. Intention to seek professional help was positively associated with positive attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help and anticipated utility and negatively with self-stigma and social support. Intention to seek nonprofessional help was positively associated with anticipated utility and social support and negatively with anticipated risk. In addition, indirect effects were found between religious affiliation and previous mental health treatment, and intention to seek professional help, through the mediating effects of attitudes and anticipated utility. Interventions for increasing intention to seek professional and nonprofessional support are important and should include reference to attitudes, anticipated utility, anticipated risk and self-stigma, and should promote mutual support and highlight the importance of support from close ones. In addition, a model for predicting intention to seek non-professional help should be developed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim: This study explored the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of higher education students towards COVID-19. In addition, this study analysed the association of socio-demographic variables with KAP apart from finding the relationship between KAP. Subject and methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in India. Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables. Conclusion: One-fourth of the students demonstrated only low and moderate levels of knowledge, negative attitude and undesirable practices in preventing COVID-19. The implications suggesting various approaches to enhance KAP to moderate the spread of COVID-19 among the students were recommended to aid the higher educational institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Aims and objectives: Overall, this study aimed to describe nursing care for patients with dementia in acute hospitals, with the objectives of describing the provided nursing care (a), nurses’ attitudes and perceptions in caring for patients with dementia (b), and exploring how nurses deal with challenging behaviour (c). Additionally, we determined background variables associated with caring for people with dementia. Background: Due to comorbidities, people with dementia are frequently admitted to acute care hospitals. Here, they are at high risk of complications. Nurses strive for good care but regularly experience insufficient knowledge and skills regarding caring for people with dementia. Design: A cross-sectional survey study design. Methods: Data were collected in seven Dutch acute hospitals and through social media. In total, 229 hospital nurses completed the questionnaire. We used the Geriatric In-Hospital Nursing Care Questionnaire and two subscales of Hynninen on managing challenging behaviour. This report followed the STROBE checklist. Results: Nurses express that they often apply general preventive interventions not explicitly related to dementia care. In general, nurses have mixed feelings about the nursing care provided in their department. For challenging behaviour, a variety of approaches, including restrictive measures and medication, is applied. The nurses’ attitudes and perceptions are influenced by the type of hospital where the nurses work, the level of education, the number of hours nurses work, and if the nurses completed a course on dementia in the last year. Conclusions: Despite a positive attitude, nurses do not have the specific knowledge and skills needed to provide proper care. Nurses who recently completed a course on dementia had more positive attitudes and perceptions towards caring for patients with dementia. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of this research can be used to improve the quality of nursing care for patients with dementia in acute hospitals. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Previous experiences with police can influence civilian perceptions of police, and in turn their expectations for future encounters. According to theories on intergroup contact, positive contact predicts positive attitudes toward the outgroup and unpleasant contact predicts negative attitudes. In the case of police-civilian encounters, pleasant interactions with the police are associated with favorable police attitudes among civilians, whereas unpleasant encounters are associated with negative attitudes. In four studies (N = 826) we assessed contact among police and civilians as related to civilian general perceptions of police and (novel to this research area) anticipated officer behavior in an imagined roadside encounter. Across studies and contact type, general perceptions mediated relationships between contact and anticipated behavior. These studies provide preliminary evidence of a process by which contact shapes general perceptions, in turn impacting anticipated police behavior. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: Behavioral intentions to care for patients with infectious diseases are crucial for improving quality of care. However, there have been few studies of the behavioral intentions and factors influencing patient care by clinical nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore cognition, attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions of clinical nurses while caring for COVID-19 patients and to explore any influencing factors. Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of nurses through convenience sampling in southeast China from February 2020 to March 2020. The questionnaire was developed based on the theory of planned behavior and self-efficacy. Results: A total of 774 nurses completed the survey. Of these, 69.12% (535/774) reported positive behavioral intentions, 75.58% (585/774) reported a positive attitude, and 63.82% (494/774) reported having the confidence to care for patients. However, the lack of support from family and friends and special allowance affected their self-confidence. Attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norms, and ethical cognition were significantly positively correlated with behavioral intentions (r = 0.719, 0.690, 0.603, and 0.546, respectively, all P < 0.001). Structural equation model showed that self-efficacy, attitude, ethical cognition, and subjective norms had positive effects on behavioral intentions (β = 0.402, 0.382, 0.091, and 0.066, respectively, P < 0.01). The total effect of behavioral intentions was influenced by attitude, ethical cognition, self-efficacy, and subjective norms (β = 0.656, 0.630, 0.402, and 0.157, respectively, P < 0.01). In addition, ethical cognition had a positive mediating effect on behavioral intentions (β = 0.539, P < 0.001). Conclusion: The study results indicated that attitude, ethical cognition, and self-efficacy were the main factors influencing nurses' behavioral intention. Efforts should be made to improve nurses' attitude and self-efficacy through ethical education and training to increase behavioral intentions to care for patients with infectious diseases, which will improve the quality of nursing care.

AB  - The need for interaction that arose given the social distancing imposed on people by governments during the COVID-19 has increased the use of social media (SM). The current study distinguishes between two different patterns of SM use: problematic and intensive, and examines the impact of each specific type of SM on social and mental aspects (i.e., social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction). The sample included 363 higher education students. Data were gathered during a second lockdown using Partial Least Squares—Structural Equation Modeling. The model indicated two different trajectories corresponding to the two types of SM users: Intensive users reported having more family support, whereas problematic users tended to feel lonely, reported having low life satisfaction, and had less support from friends. This study may allude to the possible positive role of SM use, especially during social distancing, in alleviating social and mental burdens in times of crisis.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence that subjective age is an important predictor of beneficial health outcomes besides chronological age. However, little is known about the factors associated with younger subjective age. This study aimed to identify which factors are predictive of feeling younger in old age. In this context, feeling younger was defined as an individual's perception of being younger than their current chronological age. Methods: Data from 4,665 community-dwelling older people were drawn from wave 7 (2020) of the German Aging Survey (DEAS), a nationally representative study in Germany. Network, mediation, and binomial logistic regression analyses were performed to reveal the associations between feeling younger and biopsychosocial factors. Results: A total of 4,039 participants reported feeling younger, while 626 did not. Older chronological age, engaging in sports more frequently, a better standard of living, a better state of health, higher satisfaction with life, more positive attitudes toward one's aging, and fewer depressive symptoms are associated with feeling younger in older people. Conclusion: The present study provides novel and consistent evidence regarding the association between feeling younger and biopsychosocial factors. Further research is needed to confirm these factors and identify how they can be adapted in potential intervention studies to generate the life and health circumstances that allow older people the benefit of feeling younger.

AB  - Drawing on insights from Critical Race Theory and framing theory, as well as previous research, this study ties together and analyzes public opinions about two racialized and politicized sports-related issues: (1) the financial compensation of college athletes, and (2) athlete protests during the national anthem. Consequently, we highlight racial/ethnic identities, racial attitudes, and political identities as predictors of these public opinions. Data for our analyses come from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults who were surveyed just prior to the 2016 presidential election. Descriptive results suggest that well over half of U.S. adults opposed having the NCAA pay college athletes; also, about two-thirds of adults viewed athlete protests during the national anthem as unacceptable. Regression results reveal that Black and Latinx adults were more supportive of paying college athletes and athlete protests during the national anthem than White adults. Other people of color were also more likely than White adults to support paying college athletes. Racial attitudes such as a lack of recognition of racial/ethnic inequalities in education and support for Black Lives Matter also shaped public opinions about these issues in expected ways. Finally, we find that political identities were linked to public opinions about these issues even after accounting for racial/ethnic identities and racial attitudes. Overall, this study documents public opinions about these prominent sports-related issues just prior to the 2016 election of a President who particularly racialized and politicized sports issues. Even then, these sports-related issues had been similarly filtered through both a White racial frame that encourages colorblind racism and a counter frame that promotes antiracist activism. Altogether, the present study offers further evidence of how sports provide cultural terrain for individuals to enact and negotiate racialized and politicized views of sports and society and illustrates how these processes were reflected in public opinions in 2016. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Introduction: Vaccine hesitancy remains a serious challenge for ending the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Digital media has played an immense role in the spread of information during the pandemic. One method to gauge public interest in COVID-19 related information is to examine patterns of online search queries. Methods: Google Trends (GT) was used to analyze results for search terms relating to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, information, and accessibility from October 1st, 2020 to May 27th, 2021. GT allows you to compare multiple queries at one time. The resultant relative search volumes (RSVs) range from 0 to 100. The search term and point in time on the graph that has the greatest search volume is given a score of 100 and all other terms and times are given values relative to that maximum. Search interest peaks were analyzed by subgroups (misinformation, information seeking, and access seeking) and across key time points throughout the pandemic. Results: GT analysis revealed that search interest related to vaccine misinformation, general information, and access seeking changed in relation to events taking place throughout the pandemic. The most commonly searched terms in each subgroup were: “Covid vaccine infertility”, “Covid vaccine side effects”, and “Covid vaccine appointment”. Searches related to misinformation peaked in December 2020. Search terms in the general information category peaked in April 2021. RSVs for access seeking terms peaked in March 2021 and have decreased since April 2021. Conclusion: Misinformation RSVs were highest after FDA authorization and have multiple repeated spikes after subsequent vaccine announcements. General information seeking terms peaked concurrently with increased vaccination uptake in the United States. Search interest has decreased with wider vaccine availability, despite many individuals in the United States remaining unvaccinated. GT can be used to monitor trends in public attitudes and misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines and further target education. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Due to economic growth and increasing the population of Islamic societies in the world, marketing studies have become more essential in these societies. This paper aims to study the relationship between Islamic religiosity and conspicuous consumption in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a case of Islamic societies in the Middle East. Design/methodology/approach: The data were collected by a survey of 534 respondents in Mashhad and stratified random sampling was applied. Findings: Unlike the majority of former investigations, the results showed that there is a positive relationship between Islamic religious commitment and conspicuous consumption. Furthermore, gender, social media and income are important factors in explaining the extent of conspicuous consumption. Practical implications: Luxury companies can use the results of this research to invest in Islamic countries where there is a great demand for luxury items. Additionally, it is recommended for these companies to use the potential opportunity of social media which is extremely popular in Muslim countries to advertise their products to a large population at a low price. Originality/value: The results of this study can challenge the conventional understanding of the relationship between Islamic religiosity and conspicuous consumption. According to the results of this paper, in the Middle East Islamic rich countries, it seems that Muslims have a positive attitude toward conspicuous consumption, although Islam disapproves consuming excessively by the notion of Israf. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, many humorous videos on how to practice social distancing appeared on social media. However, the effect of using humor as a crisis communication strategy to persuade people to conform to social distancing rules is not known. Objective: Drawing on the literature on humorous message framing and crisis communication, this research explores the effectiveness of a humorous message in communicating social distancing rules in two crisis severity phases (low vs. high severity) and also evaluates how humor affects individuals’ online and offline engagement intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A 2 (message framing: humorous vs. non-humorous) x 2 (crisis severity phase: low vs. high) between-subjects design experiment was conducted to test the research questions during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China from January 30 to February 2, 2020. Results: The results showed that the severity of the phase of a health crisis can significantly affect stakeholders’ online and offline responses toward the disease. More specifically, in a low severity phase, humor led to increased source likability for the message, and more online and offline engagement intentions. However, no differences between a humorous and non-humorous message in perceived risk were observed. Whereas, in a high severity crisis phase, humor reduced individuals’ offline engagement intentions and a decrease in perceived risk, no significant difference was found between a humorous and non-humorous message on source likeability. Conclusion: Humor can motivate both more online engagement and offline protective action intention when the crisis severity phase is low, while when crisis severity soars, a non-humorous message should be more desirable. More specifically, using humor in communicating information about an infectious disease can enhance the spokesperson’s likeability in a low severity phase, and also helps to spread health information to a larger audience. While, the negative side of using humor in communicating an infectious disease appears in severe crisis phases, as it then decreased the public’s perception of risk, and triggers less protective actions. Going beyond previous research, this study recognized that crisis severity changes in different phases of the spread of infectious disease, thereby providing actionable strategy selections for crisis practitioners in a dynamic communication environment.

AB  - “Rough sex” can be considered an act of sexual violence that is consensual or non-consensual, often resulting in bodily harm and in rare cases, fatalities. The rough sex defense is typically advanced by male perpetrators in an effort to portray a sexual encounter as consensual, to avoid criminal sanctions for causing injury or death. Public attitudes toward this defense are often reflected on social media following high profile cases and appear to echo dominant discourses that reinforce widely held sexual violence stereotypes. Therefore, this study aims to deconstruct public attitudes surrounding the rough sex defense. Namely, how female victims/survivors and male perpetrators of sexual violence are constructed online, whilst exploring the wider implications upon society. NVivo12 NCapture software was used to collect a sample of 1000 tweets mentioning the terms “rough sex” or “rough sex defense.” Data were examined using Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA), underpinned by a social constructionist perspective, to elicit emergent discourses. Findings indicate that Twitter allowed women to resist harmful victim-blaming discourses and constrained binary identities. Opposingly, men were constructed as sexually entitled predators, yet resisted these subject positions by advocating support for male victims/survivors. Additional analyses examine account holders’ constructions of British Parliamentarians (MP’s) and their campaigns against the rough sex defense. These constructions demonstrated a cultural, heteronormative and victim-blaming understanding of sexual violence, which calls for legislative clarity.

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to assess and compare the global development in six-month-old infants before and during the pandemic restrictive social distancing measures. Methods: This cross-sectional nested study involved infants assessed through the Griffiths Scales of Child Development (GSCD) between September 2019 and April 2021. Infants were classified in a pre-COVID or a COVID group, considering the evaluation date and the restrictive measures in place. GSCD subscales and General Development Scores (GDS) were calculated and compared. Results: One hundred and four healthy term-born infants were evaluated. GDS in the COVID group (n:70; median: 94; IQR: 90–100) appeared significantly lower than in the pre-COVID group (n:34; median: 98; IQR: 97–103; p < 0.001). Language and personal-social-emotional subareas scores appeared the most affected. A decreasing trend of GDS along with the severity of restriction was observed. Conclusion: A reduction in infant development scores was observed during pandemic social distancing. Further studies are needed to systematize these findings and to address effective public health policies for infants and families during long-term forced isolation periods.

AB  - The author intends to investigate the role of social distancing laws in the new normal as well as the effectiveness of forced shift to media online learning. This research indicates that student involvement had a moderating influence during the epidemic. This study is based on social learning theory (SLT), which endeavors to emulate the behavior, perceptions, and emotions of other individuals. The data were obtained from various Chinese universities. We gathered data utilizing the stratified sample approach as well as Google Form. A total of 256 students enrolled in a variety of programs at Chinese universities completed a questionnaire for this investigation. The direct, mediating, and moderating effects of the variables were evaluated using partial least square structural equation modeling in this study (PLS-SEM), using the Smart-PLS software 3.0. According to the findings, forced shift to media online learning acts as a mediator between the lack of social interaction, perceived harm, perception of maintaining social distancing, and the law, and the effectiveness of media online learning has a significant effect on the effectiveness of media online learning. In addition, student engagement appears to be a moderator between the forced shift to media online learning and its effectiveness. A future study might concentrate on gaining a deeper understanding of the numerous online engagement-promoting behaviors. Teachers must go above and above to provide themes that enable pupils to connect while learning. Instructors and educational institutions will benefit from the research since it will allow them to define methods for boosting social interaction in online learning and analyze methods for enhancing the efficacy of media in online learning.

AB  - Background: Social media platform is one way to share online information regarding pandemic prevention. However, there is no study regarding the attitude of health professionals toward social media use for the COVID-19-related information. This study aimed to assess health professionals' attitudes toward using social media for COVID-19-related information. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 355 health professionals in Bahir Dar city public health centers, Northwest Ethiopia. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data were entered by EPI-data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Descriptive statistics, bivariable, and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to describe respondents' attitudes toward using social media for COVID-19 information and identify associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) and a p-value with a 95% CI were calculated to measure the strength of the association and assess statistical significance. Result: Out of 341 participants, about 73% of the participants had a good attitude toward the use of social media for COVID-19 information. Age < 24 [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.74, 95% CI: (1.53–9.13)] and age group 25–34 years [AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: (1.04–4.86)], computer training [AOR = 2.03, 95% CI: (1.03–4.00)], usefulness of social media [AOR = 3.25, 95% CI: (1.58–6.67)], and trustworthiness [AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: (1.93–6.60)] were enabling factors for attitude toward the use of social media for COVID-19 related information. Conclusion: Health professionals had a moderate attitude toward using social media for accessing COVID-19-related information. This implies that after considering positive attitude predictors, such as providing basic computer training, emphasizing the usefulness of social media, and building trusted social media pages, social media platforms can be used as a source of COVID-19-related information for health professionals.

AB  - Introduction: Self-stigma arising from public stigma is a heavy burden for people suffering from mental health problems. Both public stigma and self-stigma encompass the same three elements: stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. Public stigma has already been successfully explored by the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Intergroup Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) map. However, this is not the case for self-stigma. Therefore, this is the first study that applies SCM and the BIAS map to self-stigma by examining whether the effects of self-stereotypes on self-directed discrimination would be mediated by self-directed prejudices in people with mental health problems. Method: Within a total sample of N = 823 participants, who took part in an online survey, n = 336 people reported mental health problems. Mental health and self-stereotypes (warmth, competence), self-directed prejudice (negative emotions), and self-directed discrimination (active/passive self-harm) were assessed. Results: Structural equation modeling supported the hypothesis that the stereotype dimensions warmth and competence negatively related to prejudice, while stronger prejudice was associated with more discrimination (active/passive self-harm). Prejudice fully mediated the relationship between stereotypes and discrimination. The indirect effects of warmth and competence on active and passive self-harm were moderated by competence and warmth. Discussion: Implications for further research on self-stigma and the usage of SCM and BIAS map are discussed. Copyright © 2022 Gärtner, Asbrock, Euteneuer, Rief and Salzmann.

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has affected communities of colour the hardest. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic pregnant women appear to have disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 infection and death rates. Methods and analysis We will use the socioecological framework and employ a concurrent triangulation, mixed-methods study design to achieve three specific aims: (1) examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality (SMMM); (2) explore how social contexts (eg, racial/ethnic residential segregation) have contributed to the widening of racial/ethnic disparities in SMMM during the pandemic and identify distinct mediating pathways through maternity care and mental health; and (3) determine the role of social contextual factors on racial/ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities using machine learning algorithms. We will leverage an existing South Carolina COVID-19 Cohort by creating a pregnancy cohort that links COVID-19 testing data, electronic health records (EHRs), vital records data, healthcare utilisation data and billing data for all births in South Carolina (SC) between 2018 and 2021 (>200 000 births). We will also conduct similar analyses using EHR data from the National COVID-19 Cohort Collaborative including >270 000 women who had a childbirth between 2018 and 2021 in the USA. We will use a convergent parallel design which includes a quantitative analysis of data from the 2018-2021 SC Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (unweighted n>2000) and in-depth interviews of 40 postpartum women and 10 maternal care providers to identify distinct mediating pathways. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by institutional review boards at the University of SC (Pro00115169) and the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC IRB.21-030). Informed consent will be provided by the participants in the in-depth interviews. Study findings will be disseminated with key stakeholders including patients, presented at academic conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: Since its inception, mobile payment is rapidly gaining popularity over the years, and starting to replace traditional modes of payment. The usage of mobile payments has further escalated following various precautionary measures (i.e. social distancing) in curbing the transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, most of the elderlies are still sceptical about the usage of mobile payment services. The current study was set to investigate the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers that resulted in elderlies' resistance towards using such services. The impact of stickiness to cash was also examined as a moderator on the investigated relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Online survey questionnaires were used to collect the responses from 400 elderly consumers at the age of 60 and above. Data analysis was then performed using the SPSS and AMOS statistical software packages. Findings: Findings obtained acknowledged the significance of functional (i.e. perceived complexity, perceived incompatibility and perceived cost), psychological (i.e. lack of trust, inertia, and technological anxiety) and risk (i.e. privacy risk, security risk, financial risk and operational risk) barriers in influencing resistance towards mobile payment services among the elderlies. Consequently, resistance would influence their attitude and non-adoption intention; with attitude as the mediator between resistance and non-adoption intention. Finally, moderation analysis also confirmed the moderating effect of stickiness to cash towards elevating the correlation between resistance and non-adoption intention. Originality/value: This study is one of the very few studies that explored the minimally investigated territory on the consequential importance of mobile payment usage among the elderlies, specifically, through extending the literature on the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers towards the individuals' resistance. Besides, this study also successfully contributed to existing body of knowledge by highlighting the mediating role of attitude and moderating role of stickiness to cash in the interrelationships between resistance, attitude and non-adoption intention. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to examine how consumers respond to social media influencers that are created through artificial intelligence (AI) and compares effects to traditional (human) influencers. Design/methodology/approach: Across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of AI social media influencers. With Study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for AI influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. The authors also investigate the role of an influencer’s agency – being autonomous or externally managed – to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. Study 2 acts as an extension and validation of Study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. Findings: The authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view AI and human influencers. Importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. This suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an AI or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. Furthermore, while an AI influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. In understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. Results also show that AI influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. Finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. Research limitations/implications: The studies investigate consumers’ general response to AI influencers within the context of Instagram, however, future research might examine consumers’ response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. Practical implications: The authors find that in some ways, an AI influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. Indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other AI recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to AI influencer recommendations. However, the authors find consistent evidence that AI influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their AI counterparts. Originality/value: This paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the AI influencer. Specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to AI influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction While the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of pregnant women and parents has become apparent over the past year, the impact of these changes on early social interactions, physical growth and cognitive development of their infants is unknown, as is the way in which a range of COVID-19-related changes have mediated this impact. This study (CoCoPIP) will investigate: (1) how parent's experiences of the social, medical and financial changes during the pandemic have impacted prenatal and postnatal parental mental health and parent-infant social interaction; and (2) the extent to which these COVID-19-related changes in parental prenatal and postnatal mental health and social interaction are associated with fetal and infant development. Methods and analysis The CoCoPIP study is a national online survey initiated in July 2020. This ongoing study (n=1700 families currently enrolled as of 6 May 2021) involves both quantitative and qualitative data being collected across pregnancy and infancy. It is designed to identify the longitudinal impact of the pandemic from pregnancy to 2 years of age as assessed using a range of parent- and self-report measures, with the aim of identifying if stress-associated moderators (ie, loss of income, COVID-19 illness, access to ante/postnatal support) appear to impact parental mental health, and in turn, infant development. In addition, we aim to document individual differences in social and cognitive development in toddlers who were born during restrictions intended to mitigate COVID-19 spread (eg, social distancing, national lockdowns). Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was given by the University of Cambridge, Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2020.077). Findings will be made available via community engagement, public forums (eg, social media,) and to national (eg, NHS England) and local (Cambridge Universities Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) healthcare partners. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviews journals. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the public in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted online among the general public in Malaysia from June 2020 to August 2020 between the second and third wave (Phase 3 of the Recovery Movement Control Order). Participants were conveniently recruited through multiple social media platforms to encourage nationwide participation. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. For descriptive analysis, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to report demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. For inferential analysis, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Chi-square test, and Binary Logistic Regression was used to analyze the study variables' differentiation, association, and correlations. The confidence interval selected for this study was 95%. Results: A total of 420 respondents participated in this survey. The majority of the participants (n = 412, 98%) were aware of COVID-19. Most participants (60%) learned about the pandemic through social media. About half of the participants had poor knowledge (45.5%) and a negative attitude (43.3%). Participants residing in urban areas showed good preventive practices as compared to those residing in rural areas (P < 0.05). There was a significant association between participants' attitudes and preventive practices toward COVID-19, where the majority of the participants (57.4%) who showed negative attitudes were more likely to follow poor preventive practices. Conclusion: Despite having good knowledge, participants with a negative attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to follow the preventive practices of COVID-19. People's mindset and willingness may play an important role to influence their practices. Thus, these are the vulnerable groups, and strategies should be made to change their mindset through proper counseling and education.

AB  - For many, declining biodiversity represents an emotionally and psychologically distant 'cost' - similar to how a number of people perceive climate change. Using an expectancy-value theory framework, we showed participants photographs that visibly illustrated the threat of biodiversity loss. Specifically, we tested a combination of preregistered and exploratory hypotheses through an online experiment (n = 843) to understand whether viewing photographs of plants and animals (with and without captions) bolstered people's valuing of biodiversity and willingness to donate to a nature-focused charity relative to a control group. Participants who viewed photographs (without captions) valued biodiversity more and donated more to the nature-focused charity; those who viewed photographs with captions showed similar though more muted (non-statistically significant) effects. Follow-up mediation analyses on the photographs-only participants suggested that the photographs may have catalysed negative emotions that increased valuing of biodiversity and, in turn, increased donations. This study provides preregistered evidence that thoughtfully selected photographs boost people's valuing of biodiversity and exploratory evidence that the pathway through which that might occur is more likely via negative emotions than through reduced psychological distance. Educators, conservationists, journalists and others may find these results informative as they develop strategies for addressing the acute problem of biodiversity loss. ©

AB  - Entrepreneurship is perceived as a critical pillar for unemployment alleviation and economic growth, especially in the era of COVID-19, which highlights the importance of the entrepreneurial potential of college students. The current research focused on the role of personal values in the entrepreneurial process and investigated the relationship between materialism and entrepreneurial intention among college students. Few studies have been examined this relationship, and the underlying mechanisms were also not identified. From the perspective of personal value, we hypothesized that materialism could positively predict entrepreneurial intention. Moreover, based on McClelland's theory of need for achievement and the theory of planned behavior, a serial mediation model, with achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude as the mediators, was proposed. We conducted a correlational study on a sample of 1,002 Chinese university students to examine our hypotheses. They participated in an online survey and completed the measurement of entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial attitude, materialism, and achievement motivation. The hypothesized models were examined through serial mediation bootstrapping procedures. The results showed that materialism positively predicted college students' entrepreneurial intention, and this relationship was serially mediated through achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude. Materialism boosted college students' achievement motivation, which in turn was associated with a more positive entrepreneurial attitude and subsequently stronger entrepreneurial intention. The present research is the first to empirically examine this association's mechanism and establish a serial mediation involving achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude. For the theoretical contribution, the present research provides a more comprehensive picture of the role of personal values in entrepreneurship by complementing the effect of materialism. And regarding the practical implications, the present research implies the silver lining of materialism and points out a possible way to enhance college students' entrepreneurial intention, i.e., entrepreneurial education could take advantage of the characteristics of materialism and transform the “harmful” value into socially beneficial entrepreneurial intentions through enhancing their achievement motivation and positive attitude toward entrepreneurship.

AB  - The research investigated the role of social justice in the relationship between cultural intelligence and attitude toward teaching profession. For a sustainable education, social justice and cultural intelligence are seen crucial in teaching profession. The data of the study were collected from 404 prospective teachers studying at a state university in Turkey by using a paper-based survey. For collecting the data, "Cultural Intelligence Scale (CIS)"developed by Ang et al. (2007) and adapted into Turkish by Ilhan and Cetin (2014); "Social Justice Scale (SJS)"developed by Torres-Harding et al. (2012) and adapted into Turkish by Cirik (2015); and "Attitude Scale of Teaching Profession"developed by Üstüner (2006) were used. A structural model was established and conducted to hypothesize the research questions. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to validate the measurement and structural model. The SEM-based mediating analysis using SPSS AMOS was employed to test the hypothesized relationships. According to the results, cultural intelligence predicted the attitude towards the teaching profession and also social justice. Moreover, social justice was found to be in the full mediating role in the relationship between cultural intelligence and attitude towards the teaching profession. The research concluded that social justice was an important factor in increasing cultural intelligence competencies of teacher candidates to enhance their positive attitude towards teaching profession. © 2022 Kaslm Karata? et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Czech population experienced a second lockdown lasting for about half a year, restricting free movement and imposing social isolation. However, it is not known whether the impact of this long lockdown resulted in habituation to the adverse situation or in the traumatization of the Czech population, and whether the media and specific media use contributed to these effects. Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the long lockdown on the mental health of the Czech population, and the role of exposure to COVID-19 news reports and specific forms of media news use in mental health. Methods: We conducted two consecutive surveys in the early (November 2020) and late (March/April 2021) phases of the nationwide lockdown on the same nationally representative group of Czech adults (N=1777) participating in a longitudinal panel study. Results: Our findings showed that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in the second observation period, confirming the negative effect of the pandemic lockdown as it unfolded, suggesting that restrictive measures and continuous exposure to a collective stressor did not result in the strengthening of resilience but rather in ongoing traumatization. The results also suggest a negative role of the media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mental health during the early, and particularly late, phases of the lockdown. Furthermore, we found several risk and protective factors of specific media news use. The media practice in news consumption connected to social media use was the strongest predictor of exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly in the late phase of the lockdown. Moreover, news media use characterized by internalization of information learned from the news, as well as negative attitudes toward media news, were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Conversely, the use of infotainment, together with an in-depth and contextual style of reading news articles, were related to improvement of mental health. Conclusions: Our study showed that the long lockdown resulted in traumatization rather than habituation, and in more pronounced effects (both negative and positive) of media use in mental health. © Dominika Grygarová, Petr Adámek, Veronika Juríčková, Jiří Horáček, Eduard Bakštein, Iveta Fajnerová, Ladislav Kesner

AB  - Introduction: Telehealth has a significant potential to complement and replace the traditional service paradigm. It can expand access to the interventions for children with ASD, particularly during the pandemic COVID-19. This study aimed to explore parents' experiences to carry out parent-mediated intervention (PMI) programs for their children with ASD via telehealth. Methods: This qualitative study used an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach. We conducted online individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with seven parents of children with ASD who had experienced using telehealth to carry out PMI programs for children with ASD during the pandemic COVID-19 in Malaysia. The interviews lasted between 30 and 40 minutes. All interviews were transcribed into verbatim transcripts. The transcripts were coded, categorised, and summarised by two analysts. Results: Four superordinate themes emerged from the analysis, namely; (i) Adapting with Telehealth; (ii) Challenging but Rewarding; (iii) Supports; and (iv) Hopes and Inner Drives. Despite the implementation challenges, essential experiences reported included the inner motivation and satisfaction in using telehealth services. Conclusion: Generally, parents of children with ASD have positive attitudes towards telehealth and regard it as opportunities and initiatives to further provide treatments for their children despite the restrictions during the pandemic. All participants emphasised the importance of implementing the PMI program to meet the intervention needs of ASD children. These findings highlight the parents' lived experiences of carrying out the PMI program at home with ASD children using telehealth during the pandemic and provide a catalyst for further research to deliver better services for children with ASD. © 2022 UPM Press.

AB  - Background: There are early indications that lifestyle behaviors, specifically physical activity and sleep, may be associated with the onset and progression of Huntington disease (HD). Wearable activity trackers offer an exciting opportunity to collect long-term activity data to further investigate the role of lifestyle, physical activity, and sleep in disease modification. Given how wearable devices rely on user acceptance and long-term adoption, it is important to understand users' perspectives on how acceptable any device might be and how users might engage over the longer term. Objective: This study aimed to explore the perceptions, motivators, and potential barriers relating to the adoption of wearable activity trackers by people with HD for monitoring and managing their lifestyle and sleep. This information intended to guide the selection of wearable activity trackers for use in a longitudinal observational clinical study. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study; this allowed us to draw on the potential strengths of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Opportunistic participant recruitment occurred at 4 Huntington's Disease Association meetings, including 1 international meeting and 3 United Kingdom-based regional meetings. Individuals with HD, their family members, and carers were invited to complete a user acceptance questionnaire and participate in a focus group discussion. The questionnaire consisted of 35 items across 8 domains using a 0 to 4 Likert scale, along with some additional demographic questions. Average questionnaire responses were recorded as positive (score>2.5), negative (score<1.5), or neutral (score between 1.5 and 2.5) opinions for each domain. Differences owing to demographics were explored using the Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Focus group discussions (conducted in English) were driven by a topic guide, a vignette scenario, and an item ranking exercise. The discussions were audio recorded and then analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: A total of 105 completed questionnaires were analyzed (47 people with HD and 58 family members or carers). All sections of the questionnaire produced median scores >2.5, indicating a tendency toward positive opinions on wearable activity trackers, such as the devices being advantageous, easy and enjoyable to use, and compatible with lifestyle and users being able to understand the information from trackers and willing to wear them. People with HD reported a more positive attitude toward wearable activity trackers than their family members or caregivers (P = .02). A total of 15 participants participated in 3 focus groups. Device compatibility and accuracy, data security, impact on relationships, and the ability to monitor and self-manage lifestyle behaviors have emerged as important considerations in device use and user preferences. Conclusions: Although wearable activity trackers were broadly recognized as acceptable for both monitoring and management, various aspects of device design and functionality must be considered to promote acceptance in this clinical cohort. © Philippa Morgan-Jones, Annabel Jones, Monica Busse, Laura Mills, Philip Pallmann, Cheney Drew, Astri Arnesen, Fiona Wood, Domino-HD Consortium.

AB  - Thanks largely to the affordances of social media, the Covid-19 pandemic has provoked a glut of neologisms, loan-words, abbreviations, calques and other linguistic variants. The crisis was accompanied in most nations by social measures curtailing what have long been seen as fundamental liberties; hence, it has foregrounded the re-emergence of old controversies about individualism vs collectivism, the nature of personal freedom, the role of the state, the right to healthcare, the distribution of wealth, and so on. On the UK side, our study explores some emergent neologisms in English and Russian, especially implicit meaning in terms like "social distancing"and "lockdown". We consider cross-cultural implications that relate to the way each national group conceptualized, and lived through, the experiences of lockdown. Linguistic practices may reflect deep-seated habits of being that characterize different countries, and thus our research may shed light on long-standing questions of national stereotypes. We look at some of the Covid-19 neologisms produced and/or used in British and Russian contexts, on the assumption that, by comparing these micro-linguistic practices, it is possible to learn something concerning the cultural realities of the countries in question, along the lines proposed in the works of Hofstede (2001) and Wierzbicka (2003). © 2022 Douglas Ponton et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - This cross-national study examined the mental health between those individuals working and those not working nine months post initial COVID-19 social distancing implementation. Respondents (N = 3,474) were recruited through social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and completed an online survey in October/November 2020. The respondents were from Norway, the UK, the USA and Australia. The mental health of those working and not working were analysed using t tests and socio-demographics were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Respondents who were working were significantly more likely to experience better mental health, were younger, report higher levels of education, and significantly less likely to worry about their own situation, health or financial situation than respondents who were not employed. Respondents who were retired reported better mental health than respondents who were not working for other reasons (laid off/dismissed, receiving benefits, studying, other). These findings raise the importance for social workers and other health service providers to monitor the overall mental health of individuals especially when social distancing protocols are in place and as countries begin to recover from the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Sexting (sending and receiving sexual messages) could entail risk for adolescent users. Hence, it is important that parents are able to address their children’s sexuality and mediate to them the implications of sexting. The goal of the current study was to identify parental factors that lead to dysfunctional communication about sexting among 427 parents of Israeli adolescents (ages 10–18) and to determine whether parents’ perceived severity of sexting and perceived susceptibility of sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of online questionnaires. Findings indicated that of the parenting styles examined, the authoritarian and permissive styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent-child communication. The authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes regarding sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity and susceptibility of their children’s sexting activities. It appears that the quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and phenomena and modulate their communication regarding the implied risks accordingly. Moreover, ethnic differences emerged between Arab and Jewish parents with regard to the quality of parent-child communication about sexting. Specifically, Arab parents tended more toward dysfunctional communication about sexting than did Jewish parents. Findings suggest that perceiving the implications of sexting as too risky diminishes parents’ ability to conduct a high-quality discussion. In conclusion, parents need to mediate and conduct constructive discussions with their children regarding this topic. © 2022, Interactive Media Institute. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organ transplantation is the most effective therapy for end-stage organ failure, but there is an organ shortage due to increasing demand and decreasing availability for a multitude of reasons. We investigated awareness and attitudes toward organ donation among university students, who may be future donors. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional study involving students at An-Najah National University, Nablus, West Bank, occupied Palestinian territory, between December, 2018, and April, 2019. Sociodemographic data and information about knowledge and attitudes towards organ donation were collected with a self-administered validated questionnaire in Arabic. Students were recruited by proportionate stratified random sampling from all 11 university faculties. Convenience sampling was used to obtain the final study sample. All respondents provided written informed consent to participate. SPSS version 21 was used to perform the χ2 test and ANOVA and the significance level was set at p<0·05. The study was approved by the An-Najah National University Institutional Review Board. FINDINGS: 472 students (207 men and 265 women) were included in the study. The mean age of respondents was 21 (SD 3·06) years. 433 (92%) were undergraduates and 39 (8%) were postgraduates. 467 (99%) participants had heard about organ donation. The most common source of information, reported by 261 (56%) students, was mass media (television, internet, newspapers, etc). 360 (76%) of respondents had a positive attitude toward organ donation while alive, with altruism being the most prevalent motivation 276 (77%). Willingness to help a family member was the most common reason for living donation (108 [30%] respondents). 61 (13%) replied that they would donate organs for money. 330 (70%) of 472 reported knowledge of possible risks related to living organ donation, including general weakness 56 (17%) and infection 36 (11%). Willingness to donate after death was reported by 302 (64%) of 472 respondents. We found significant associations between this choice and sex (p=0·023) and type of faculty (p=0·01). 257 (55%) of 472 did not know whether there is any national law regulating organ donation and 274 (58%) did not know the religious position. Of those positive about donation, 184 (61%) of 302 willing to donate after death said that consent to use organs could be provided by a family member, whereas 266 (74%) of 360 willing to be living donors would make the decision themselves. 148 (31%) would not promote organ donation mainly due to concerns about possible misuse (44 [30%]) and fear of organ trafficking (46 [31%]). Among the sample, one respondent had donated a kidney to a family member. INTERPRETATION: The responses to our survey a good level of awareness and knowledge about organ donation among university students. Increased information and discussion on the risks and consequences of organ donation, the relevant legislation, and the position of religion are indicated, especially in the mass media. Finally, addressing the fears, mistrust, and misinformation among students, who are viewed as an educated segment of society and a force for change in their communities, may convert them into goodwill ambassadors for the organ donation cause.None.

AB  - Purpose The study examined Covid-19 vaccinations intentions among literate Ghanaians and how it is been influenced by vaccine mistrust and the fear of the unforeseen side effects. Design/Methodology/Approach We used cross sectional data collected from 223 respondents by means of questionnaire disseminated through social media from 16th to 20th April, 2021. Likert-scale questions were asked regarding the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of literate Ghanaians towards COVID-19 vaccines. Kruskal-Wallis and sample t-test were performed to ascertain the differences in vaccination intentions between key socioeconomic variables. A pairwise correlation was performed to examine the relationship between vaccination intensions and fear of the unforeseen, mistrust of the vaccine and concerns of profiteering. Finally, a binary probit regression model was fitted to examine the predictive effect of key variables on respondent’s vaccination intentions. Findings The results revealed a relatively low level of knowledge about the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. The sample t-test showed that males have a relatively positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccines than females at 5% level of significance. Mistrust of vaccine safety and efficacy have a significant negative influence on vaccination intensions at 1% significance level. Originality/Value This study provides the Ghanaian government and other stakeholders with useful information to aid in educational campaigns on the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. More campaign efforts towards females could help increase uptake given their relatively poor attitudes towards the vaccine. Copyright: © 2022 Awuni et al.

AB  - Global vaccination coverage is an urgent need to recover the recent pandemic COVID-19. However, people are concerned about the safety and efficacy of this vaccination program. Thus, it has become crucial to examine the knowledge, attitude, and hesitancy towards the vaccine. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among university students of Bangladesh. Total of 449 university students participated. Most of these students used the internet (34.74%), social media (33.41%), and electronic media (25.61%) as a source of COVID-19 vaccine information. Overall, 58.13% and 64.81% of university students reported positive knowledge and attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine. 54.34% of these students agreed that the COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective. 43.88% believed that the vaccine could stop the pandemic. The Spearman’s Rank correlation determined the positive correlation between knowledge and attitude. The negative correlation was determined between positive knowledge and hesitancy, and positive attitude and hesitancy. University students with positive knowledge and attitude showed lower hesitancy. Multiple logistic regression analyses determined the university type and degree major as the predictors of knowledge, whereas only degree major was the predictor of attitudes. 26.06% of the study population showed their hesitancy towards the vaccine. University type and degree major were also determined as predictors of this hesitancy. They rated fear of side effects (87.18%) and lack of information (70.94%) as the most reasons for the hesitancy. The findings from this study can aid the ongoing and future COVID-19 vaccination plan for university students. The national and international authorities can have substantial information for a successful inoculation campaign. © 2022 Rahman et al.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have advocated numerous social distancing measures, and compliance with these has likely saved millions of lives globally. In an online sample drawn from the U.S. and Canada (N = 209), participants completed measures of political orientation, moral foundations, and COVID-19 social distancing attitudes and behaviours. A more left-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the individualizing moral foundations were significantly related to more positive social distancing attitudes, and greater self-reported compliance with relevant restrictions. A more right-wing political orientation, and greater endorsement of the binding and economic liberty foundations were associated with less positive attitudes and reduced compliance. In a series of mediation analyses, the relationships between political orientation and various social distancing measures were significantly mediated by variations in participants’ moral foundations, particularly their endorsement of economic liberty and the individualizing foundations. Further data indicated that the perceived persuasiveness of messages based on each moral foundation advocating for continued social distancing was significantly related to both participants’ moral values and their political orientation. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding politicized differences around social distancing as partly reflecting differential valuation of the moral foundations, and in creating effective public health messaging regarding compliance.

AB  - Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goes hand in hand with realising a more sustainable future, taking into account environmental, economic and social dimensions. Education can accelerate these goals, with teachers playing a central role. In 2021, a study was conducted among teachers in Italian mandatory schools to investigate knowledge, sources of information and attitudes towards the SDGs. An online survey was conducted, based on a Likert-scale with 62 items. The questionnaire was completed by 417 teachers. The overall knowledge score shows a median of 42.9%, an interquartile range of 25% and a range of 1.8–91.1%. A very good level of knowledge among teachers is limited to some topics, such as the Greenhouse effect (19.6%) and Resilience (13%), which may be better known due to wider media coverage. Sustainability issues are not yet considered as a shared responsibility, as teaching in designated hours was often suggested. The commitment of Italian teachers and schools to a stronger integration of sustainability issues into didactic programmes still needs to be improved. A change of perspective is urgently needed, whereby sustainability education should be seen as a collective responsibility. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - While the effect of academic discipline on political attitudes has long been acknowledged, much less is known on how disciplinary background affects policy attitudes. Linder and Peters (1992) argued that attitudes to policy instruments correspond with discipline: lawyers are assumed to tend to be partial to legalistic regulatory instruments, economists to favor economic tools such as loans or taxation. Nevertheless, relevant empirical evidence is almost non-existent. The paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing policy instruments attitudes in different academic disciplines on a sample of Czech university students (N = 8820). We inquire whether students in different academic fields (with special emphasis on economics, law, education, political science, and mass media/journalism) differ in their political and policy views. In line with previous research, students pursuing economics and law (as well as education) are found to be more right-wing oriented than students of political science and mass media. Students also differ in terms of their overall acceptance of policy instruments, with those of political science being the most accepting of all types of instruments. However, we find little support for the correspondence thesis proposed by Linder and Peters. © 2022 Arnošt Veselý et al.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine how prejudice and attitude toward people with severe mental illness, formed through exposure to the mass media, affect discriminatory behavior toward them. Methods Between September and November 2019, demographic data were collected using an online survey of 622 adults residing in South Korea. The scales used in this study were taken from the 2008 survey by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Structural equation modeling was performed for a comparative analysis of the direct and indirect effects. Results Virtual experience through mass media exposure had a statistically significant effect on prejudice against people with severe mental illness. Direct experience had a positive influence on reducing prejudice and discriminatory behavior. The direct effects of prejudice on discriminatory behavior were significant. In terms of indirect effects, the full mediating effect of prejudice was significant for the virtual experience through the mass media-prejudice-discriminatory behavior path, and the partial mediating effect of prejudice was significant on the direct experience-prejudice-discrimination behavior path. Conclusion This study recommends more careful reporting of mental illness in the media, promoting anti-stigmatization programs that provide opportunities for direct contact between the public and people with severe mental illness. © 2022.

AB  - Introduction The use of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an "infodemic" of mis- and disinformation with potentially grave consequences. To explore means of counteracting disinformation, we analyzed tweets containing the hashtags #Scamdemic and #Plandemic. Methods Using a Twitter scraping tool called twint, we collected 419,269 English-language tweets that contained “#Scamdemic” or “#Plandemic” posted in 2020. Using the Twitter application-programming interface, we extracted the same tweets (by tweet ID) with additional user metadata. We explored descriptive statistics of tweets including their content and user profiles, analyzed sentiments and emotions, performed topic modeling, and determined tweet availability in both datasets. Results After removal of retweets, replies, non-English tweets, or duplicate tweets, 40,081 users tweeted 227,067 times using our selected hashtags. The mean weekly sentiment was overall negative for both hashtags. One in five users who used these hashtags were suspended by Twitter by January 2021. Suspended accounts had an average of 610 followers and an average of 6.7 tweets per user, while active users had an average of 472 followers and an average of 5.4 tweets per user. The most frequent tweet topic was “Complaints against mandates introduced during the pandemic” (79,670 tweets), which included complaints against masks, social distancing, and closures. Discussion While social media has democratized speech, it also permits users to disseminate potentially unverified or misleading information that endangers people’s lives and public health interventions. Characterizing tweets and users that use hashtags associated with COVID-19 pandemic denial allowed us to understand the extent of misinformation. With the preponderance of inaccessible original tweets, we concluded that posters were in denial of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought to disperse related mis- or disinformation resulting in suspension. Conclusion Leveraging 227,067 tweets with the hashtags #scamdemic and #plandemic in 2020, we were able to elucidate important trends in public disinformation about the COVID-19 vaccine. © 2022 Lanier et al.

AB  - Background: Effective interventions aimed at correcting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, known as fact-checking messages, are needed to combat the mounting antivaccine infodemic and alleviate vaccine hesitancy. Objective: This work investigates (1) the changes in the public's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines over time, (2) the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information on social media engagement and attitude change, and (3) the emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information ecosystem. Methods: We collected a data set of 12,553 COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking Facebook posts and their associated comments (N=122,362) from January 2020 to March 2022 and conducted a series of natural language processing and statistical analyses to investigate trends in public attitude toward the vaccine in COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts and comments, and emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 fact-checking information ecosystem. Results: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all COVID-19 vaccine posts peaked in May 2020 and then steadily decreased as the pandemic progressed (r=–0.92, df=21, t=–10.94, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.82, P<.001). The salience of COVID-19 vaccine entities was significantly lower in comments (mean 0.03, SD 0.03, t=39.28, P<.001) than in posts (mean 0.09, SD 0.11). Third-party fact checkers have been playing a more important role in more fact-checking over time (r=0.63, df=25, t=4.06, 95% CI 0.33-0.82, P<.001). COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical (r=0.81, df=25, t=6.88, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P<.001) and more confident (r=0.59, df=25, t=3.68, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, P=.001) over time. Although comments did not exhibit a significant increase in confidence over time, tentativeness in comments significantly decreased (r=–0.62, df=25, t=–3.94, 95% CI –0.81 to –0.31, P=.001). In addition, although hospitals receive less engagement than other information sources, the comments expressed more positive attitudinal valence in comments compared to other information sources (b=0.06, 95% CI 0.00-0.12, t=2.03, P=.04). Conclusions: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all posts about the vaccine steadily decreased after May 2020. As the pandemic progressed, third-party fact checkers played a larger role in posting fact-checking COVID-19 vaccine posts. COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical and more confident over time, reflecting increased confidence in posts. Similarly, tentativeness in comments decreased; this likewise suggests that public uncertainty diminished over time. COVID-19 fact-checking vaccine posts from hospitals yielded more positive attitudes toward vaccination than other information sources. At the same time, hospitals received less engagement than other information sources. This suggests that hospitals should invest more in generating engaging public health campaigns on social media. ©Haoning Xue, Xuanjun Gong, Hannah Stevens.

AB  - Background The first COVID-19 case in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was reported on 10 March 2020 in Kinshasa, prompting the government to promote internationally agreed non-pharmacological interventions for infection prevention and control. Public compliance to these measures is critical and depends on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of communities regarding COVID-19, for which there was no data. This study aimed to bridge that gap. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Kinshasa in June 2020, during the emergency state, following a four-stage sampling process. Master’s students from the Kinshasa School of Public Health conducted the survey. Descriptive and regression analyses were performed. Results The study enrolled 726 women and 600 men (mean age: 43; SD 16-85). Nearly everyone heard about COVID-19 (mainly through television, radio, and street reports), but only 17% were highly knowledgeable about its transmission modes, signs and symptoms, and preventive measures. More than 80% of participants believed in the disease’s seriousness; however, only 21% found the total lockdown acceptable. Nonetheless, 86% reported regular hand cleaning and mask-wearing followed by physical distancing (72%). Poorer, younger, and non-Catholic participants were overall markedly less knowledgeable and had comparatively lower levels of health-protective attitudes, acceptance, and practices. The education level and household size did not matter. Female participants tended to show fewer enabling attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 prevention measures compared to men. Conclusion Adequate public health information to improve the population’s KAP related to COVID-19 is critical and must be designed with and delivered to the community—considering the specific needs of diverse sub-groups and contexts. Studies in Kinshasa and similar settings are necessary to understand the barriers to and enablers of acquiring, applying, and maintaining the optimal population’s KAP for COVID-19 prevention and control. © 2022 Akilimali et al.

AB  - Coronavirus popularly known as COVID-19 is a pandemic that stormed the globe and rendered strong nations helpless and even the world powers, powerless. Initially, the Nigerian government was reluctant to put measures in place or lock its borders until a returnee was diagnosed after he had infected some people. This necessitated several measures including total lockdown, social distancing and improved personal hygiene to forestall its spread. Moreover, Nigerians believe that the state of the nation is even worse than this pandemic and, thus, have developed mastery, especially via satire in weathering any kind of storm. It is therefore, not surprising that the Facebook has become a veritable platform where Nigerians evoke humour while exposing human foibles in their linguistic disposition, with the intention to improve the society. This study, therefore, examined the satirical devices in the Facebook posts of Nigerians with the aim of teasing out the ideologies portrayed in relation to the existing social, economic and political attitude of the people towards the pandemic. Consequently, 22 Facebook posts were purposively selected for analysis, drawing input from Horatian’s approach to satire and Fairclough’s (1995) sociocultural approach to Critical Discourse Analysis. The analysis reveals various satirical elements deployed as a subtle and effective alternative to contest power abuse, social injustice and propagate change. The study also reveals the wittiness and absurdity of satire that makes it a ready tool to unbridle people’s feelings; laden with different ideologies with the aim of relaxing tension and catalysing transformation in the society. Moreover, the import of weathering the storm becomes bare as an essential make-up of Nigerians; the tinge of humour intended in the posts relieves perceived tension and reminds the readers to take life easy, thus, making the study quite engaging. © 2022 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - This study developed and examined a theoretical model of moderated mediation in which positive and negative environmental behaviours (e.g., attitudes, destruction, conservation, and eco-friendliness) serve as a moderating mechanism that explains the link between the two critical mediating effects of escape and sustainable experiences on revisit intentions. The results of a study of 483 foreign tourists provide support for our hypothesized model. First, the results showed that motivations have indirect and positive effects on revisit intentions through sustainable experiences and escape-seeking. Second, the moderating effects of positive environmental behaviours were found to be positive, while negative environmental behaviours had negative effects on the dimensions of escape and experience on revisit intentions for sustainable tourism. Third, we discussed how this interesting pattern of the moderated mediation setting could be explained by using the theoretical background and considering previous studies on sustainable tourism. © 2022 by the authorsLicensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Recognizing an urgent need to understand the dynamics of the pandemic’s severity, this longitudinal study is conducted to explore the evolution of complex relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, and social distancing patterns in a diverse set of 86 countries. Collecting data from multiple sources, a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique is applied to understand the interdependencies between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables. Results show that lockdown and confinement measures are very effective to reduce human mobility at retail and recreation facilities, transit stations, and workplaces and encourage people to stay home and thereby control COVID-19 transmission at critical times. The study also found that national contexts rooted in socioeconomic and institutional factors influence social distancing patterns and severity of the pandemic, particularly with regard to the vulnerability of people, treatment costs, level of globalization, employment distribution, and degree of independence in society. Additionally, this study portrayed a mutual relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility. A higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reduces human mobility and the countries with reduced personal mobility have experienced a deepening of the severity of the pandemic. However, the effect of mobility on pandemic severity is stronger than the effect of pandemic situations on mobility. Overall, the study displays considerable temporal changes in the relationships between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables considering pandemic situations and lockdown regimes, which provides a critical knowledge base for future handling of pandemics. It has also accommodated some policy guidelines for the authority to control the transmission of COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Nutrition information on food labels can help consumers to choose healthier food. We investigated consumers’ awareness of food labels and their influence on the decision to buy food items among students of health sciences of King Khalid University, Abha. This cross-sectional study involved 350 females who gave informed verbal consent and were selected by systematic random sampling technique. Data was collected by using a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS version 21. Overall 76.3% of students knew food labeling. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the knowledge about food labeling and education, the number of family members, earning members, frequency of shopping and income. Almost half of the students checked food labels before buying, 43.7% replaced food on an importance basis and value of labeling, and 60% replaced on a cost basis. More than half of students were ready to buy food items with no labels, and 21.7% even utilized expired food items because of a lack of knowledge regarding expiry date and low cost of food which could be hazardous for their health. Awareness of food labeling and expiry date should be enhanced by including this subject in the curriculum and electronic media to avoid health hazards of expired food items. Choosing healthy food options shall reduce the nutrition and chronic diseases among the general population in future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - A core assumption often heard in public health discourse is that increasing trust in national political leaders is essential for securing public health compliance during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–ongoing). However, studies of national government trust are typically too coarse-grained to differentiate between trust in institutions versus more interpersonal trust in political leaders. Here, we present multiscale trust measurements for twelve countries and territories across the West, Oceania and East Asia. These trust results were used to identify which specific domains of government and social trust were most crucial for securing public health compliance (frequency of mask wearing and social distancing) and understanding the reasons for following health measures (belief in effectiveness of public health measures). Through the use of linear regression and structural equation modeling, our cross-cultural survey-based analysis (N = 3369 subjects) revealed that higher trust in national and local public health institutions was a universally consistent predictor of public health compliance, while trust in national political leaders was not predictive of compliance across cultures and geographical regions. Institutional trust was mediated by multiple types of transparency, including providing rationale, securing public feedback, and honestly expressing uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing between components of government trust, to better understand which entities the public gives the most attention to during crises. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic within the United States of America resulted in over 800,000 deaths as of February 2022 and has been addressed by social distancing or stay-at-home measures. Collective prolonged multimodal trauma on this scale is likely to elicit symptomatology in the general population consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), somatization, anxiety, and stress. The psychological component of this response contributes substantially to the burden of this disease worldwide. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between COVID-19-related concern, anxiety, and perceived stress on PTSD-like symptomatology over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited via social media within the United States of America between 8th May 2020 and 11th August 2021 to complete an internet questionnaire including mood, personality, and COVID-19-specific scales. General anxiety and PTSD-like symptomatology were above the screening cutoffs for most respondents. These measures increased in severity over the pandemic, with the change point of our Concern scale preceding that of the other significant measures. Measures of COVID-19-related concern, generalized anxiety, and PTSD-like symptomatology were strongly correlated with each other. Anxiety, perceived stress, and PTSD-like symptomatology are strongly interrelated, increase with pandemic length, and are linked to reported levels of concern over COVID-19. These observations may aid future research and policy as the pandemic continues. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston’s poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the ‘threatening other’. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Studies on previous outbreaks of contagious diseases suggest that the impact of the emotions associated with an epidemic can be greater than that of the epidemic in terms of the number of people affected. This study explores the relationships between the three most commonly expressed emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic (fear, anger, and depression) and two outcome variables (compliance with the social-distancing policy and the stigmatization of those infected by COVID-19). A large online, public opinion survey was conducted in South Korea (n = 1000) between 4 and 11 June 2020, which was between the first and the second waves of COVID-19. A series of regression analyses suggest that the emotional response was accompanied by differential behavioral and perceptual consequences. Fear was consistently positively related to all indicators of compliance with social-distancing policies (the voluntary practice of social distancing, support for the “routine-life-distancing” policy, and support for stronger social-distancing policies). Anger was positively related to both stigmatization indicators (responsibility attribution and stigmatizing attitude toward people infected with COVID-19). Finally, depression showed negative relationships with support for the “routine-life-distancing” policy and for stronger social-distancing policies but a positive relationship with the voluntary practice of social distancing. By examining whether and how certain types of emotional responses are more or less related to compliance with social distancing and stigmatization, the present study provides practical implications for effective public communication during an epidemic such as COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The Arab ethnic community in Israel is characterized by low social economic status and is at risk due to the typically crowded households. Understanding parents’ level of awareness is important to avoid new outbreaks. Objectives: This study seeks to identify predicting factors associated with perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted through social media, using snowball sampling via social networks. Addi-tionally, t-tests, Chi-square tests, and Z tests were used to evaluate differences between independent proportions. Pearson correlations were calculated for the study variables. Multiple logistic regression examined the extent to which the background variables were related to the intention to vaccinate the child. Results: A total of 2843 Arab parents participated in the study. Older parents, higher socioeconomic status, higher trust in the authorities, vaccinated parents, and low psychological and physical barriers were positively correlated with willingness to vaccinate children. Pandemic fatigue was associated with less positive attitudes and reduced perceived effectiveness toward vaccination. Conclusion: Addressing minorities’ poor standards of living and physical and psychological barriers posed by the authorities to minorities’ access to vaccination may increase compliance with COVID-19 vaccination and protect the health of the entire population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Although comprehensive digitalization (e.g., the provision of skills and resources) had already been placed on Austria’s education policy agenda prior to the emergence of COVID-19, there is evidence that educators had some difficulty ensuring digital learning opportunities for their students when schools closed in early 2020. Against this backdrop, the present study, which drew on qualitative data from the large-scale INCL-LEA (Inclusive Home Learning) study, aimed to determine whether secondary school teachers (n = 17) from Viennese schools met the prerequisites for successfully implementing digital instruction, formulated in the Will–Skill–Tool model developed by Christensen and Kzenek (2008). Findings reveal that teachers primarily associated their sufficient digital skills with three factors: (1) basic interest and competence, (2) recently attended training, and/or (3) a positive attitude toward changing teaching practices. Interestingly, some educators recognized that digitization offers great potential for implementing individualized teaching approaches. However, the findings point to the didactic necessity of digital socialization in terms of social communication and inclusion when establishing emergency digital education. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Young adults were vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the underlying pathway by which COVID-19-related stress influences mental health outcomes among young adults remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of social support and resilience between COVID-19-related stress and mental health outcomes. A sample of 1000 Korean young adults was obtained via online survey. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing COVID-19-related stress, social support, resilience, depression, and anxiety. Overall, 48.1% and 23.4% of participants were classified as having depression and anxiety states, respectively. Path analysis using AMOS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) showed that the direct effects of stress from social distancing difficulties on depression and anxiety were much greater than those of stress from fear of infection and anger toward others. In addition, there were significant indirect effects of social support and resilience in the relationship between stress related to difficulties due to social distancing and mental health outcomes. The mediating roles of social support and resilience suggest that interventions to increase these factors can be effective strategies to reduce the risks of depression and anxiety among young adults suffering from stress related to social distancing difficulties. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives To assess the impact of relaxing the state of alarm restrictions on SARS-CoV-2 infections at 14 days among people attending reopened nightclub venues. Design Matched cohort study with a paired control group (1:5 ratio). Setting Five small nightclubs with indoor areas and outdoor terraces, in a nightlife-restricted area in Sitges, Spain, on 20 May 2021. Wearing masks was mandatory, drinking was allowed and social distance was not required. Participants Volunteers were selected through a convenience sampling. To attend the event, participants were required to be older than 17 years, with a negative rapid antigen diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) on the same afternoon, without a positive reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or Ag-RDT and/or symptoms associated with COVID-19 in the previous 7 days, to not having knowingly been in close contact with someone infected in the previous 10 days and to not have knowingly had close contact with someone with a suspicion of COVID-19 in the previous 48 hours. A control group was paired by exact age, gender, residence municipality, socioeconomic index, previous SARS-CoV-2-confirmed infection and vaccination status, in a 1:5 ratio, from the primary care electronic health records. Primary outcome Evidence of infection at electronic health records by SARS-CoV-2 at 14-day follow-up. Results Among the 391 participants (median age 37 years; 44% (n=173) women), no positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected at 14 days, resulting in a cumulative incidence estimation of 0 (95% CI 0 to 943) per 100 000 inhabitants. In the control group, two cases with RT-PCR test were identified, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 102.30 (12.4 to 369) per 100 000 inhabitants. Conclusions Nightlife attendance under controlled conditions and with a requirement for a negative Ag-RDT was not associated with increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in a pandemic context of low infection rates. In such circumstances, secure opening of the nightlife sector was possible, under reduced capacity and controlled access by Ag-RDT, and environments where compliance with sanitary measures are maintainable. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, much research has been devoted to assessing mental health in a variety of populations. Students in higher education appear to be particularly vulnerable to experiencing reduced mental health. The purpose of the study was to assess whether higher education students experienced poorer mental health compared to the general population and examine the factors associated with students’ mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-national sample of students (n = 354) and non-students (n = 3120) participated in a survey in Octo-ber/November 2020. Mental health outcomes among students and non-students were compared with independent t-tests. Multiple linear regression analysis and general linear estimation were used to assess the impact of student status on mental health outcomes while adjusting for socio-demographic factors. Students reported poorer mental health than non-students. The difference in mental health between students and non-students was bigger for participants aged 30 years or older. More social media use was associated with poorer mental health outcomes. In conclusion, students had poorer mental health than the wider population. Aspects of life as a student, beyond what can be attributed to life stage, appears to increase mental health problems. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the first trimester affect the risk of miscarriage before 13 week's gestation? SUMMARY ANSWER: Pregnant women with self-reported diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in the first trimester had a higher risk of early miscarriage. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Viral infections during pregnancy have a broad spectrum of placental and neonatal pathology. Data on the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy are still emerging. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses reported an increased risk of preterm birth, caesarean delivery, maternal morbidity and stillbirth. Data on the impact of first trimester infection on early pregnancy outcomes are scarce. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to investigate the rates of early pregnancy loss during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak among women with self-reported infection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a nationwide prospective cohort study of pregnant women in the community recruited using social media between 21 May and 31 December 2020. We recruited 3545 women who conceived during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic who were <13 week's gestation at the time of recruitment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The COVID-19 Contraception and Pregnancy Study (CAP-COVID) was an on-line survey study collecting longitudinal data from pregnant women in the UK aged 18 years or older. Women who were pregnant during the pandemic were asked to complete on-line surveys at the end of each trimester. We collected data on current and past pregnancy complications, their medical history and whether they or anyone in their household had symptoms or been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during each trimester of their pregnancy. RT-PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from respiratory samples (e.g. nasopharynx) is the standard practice for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. We compared rate of self-reported miscarriage in three groups: 'presumed infected', i.e. those who reported a diagnosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the first trimester; 'uncertain', i.e. those who did not report a diagnosis but had symptoms/household contacts with symptoms/diagnosis; and 'presumed uninfected', i.e. those who did not report any symptoms/diagnosis and had no household contacts with symptoms/diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 3545 women registered for the CAP-COVID study at <13 weeks gestation and were eligible for this analysis. Data for the primary outcome were available from 3041 women (86%). In the overall sample, the rate of self-reported miscarriage was 7.8% (238/3041 [95% CI, 7-9]). The median gestational age (GA) at miscarriage was 9 weeks (interquartile range 8-11). Seventy-seven women were in the 'presumed infected' group (77/3041, 2.5% [95% CI 2-3]), 295/3041 were in the uncertain group (9.7% [95% CI 9-11]) and the rest in the 'presumed uninfected' (87.8%, 2669/3041 [95% CI 87-89]). The rate of early miscarriage was 14% in the 'presumed infected' group, 5% in the 'uncertain' and 8% in the 'presumed uninfected' (11/77 [95% CI 6-22] versus 15/295 [95% CI 3-8] versus 212/2669 [95% CI 7-9], P = 0.02). After adjusting for age, BMI, ethnicity, smoking status, GA at registration and the number of previous miscarriages, the risk of early miscarriage appears to be higher in the 'presumed infected' group (relative rate 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0, P = 0.06). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: We relied on self-reported data on early pregnancy loss and SARS-CoV-2 infection without any means of checking validity. Some women in the 'presumed uninfected' and 'uncertain' groups may have had asymptomatic infections. The number of 'presumed infected' in our study was low and therefore the study was relatively underpowered. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This was a national study from the UK, where infection rates were one of the highest in the world. Based on the evidence presented here, women who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their first trimester may be at an increased risk of a miscarriage. However, the overall rate of miscarriage in our study population was 8%. This is reassuring and suggests that if there is an effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the risk of miscarriage, this may be limited to those with symptoms substantial enough to lead to a diagnostic test. Further studies are warranted to evaluate a causal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection in early pregnancy and miscarriage risk. Although we did not see an overall increase in the risk of miscarriage, the observed comparative increase in the presumed infected group reinforces the message that pregnant women should continue to exercise social distancing measures and good hygiene throughout their pregnancy to limit their risk of infection STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was supported by a grant from the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital Charity (G13-559194).

AB  - The illegal wildlife trade is resulting in worldwide biodiversity loss and species’ extinction. It should be exposed so that the problems of conservation caused by it can be highlighted and resolutions can be found. Social media is an effective method of information dissemination, providing a real-time, low-cost, and convenient platform for the public to release opinions on wildlife protection. This paper aims to explore the usage of social media in understanding public opinions toward conservation events, and illegal rhino trade is an example. This paper provides a framework for analyzing rhino protection issues by using Twitter. A total of 83,479 useful tweets and 33,336 pieces of users’ information were finally restored in our database after filtering out irrelevant tweets. With 2422 records of trade cases, this study builds up a rhino trade network based on social media data. The research shows important findings: (1) Tweeting behaviors are somewhat affected by the information of traditional mass media. (2) In general, countries and regions with strong negative sentiment tend to have high volume of rhino trade cases, but not all. (3) Social celebrities’ participation in activities arouses wide public concern, but the influence does not last for more than a month. NGOs, GOs, media, and individual enterprises are dominant in the dissemination of information about rhino trade. This study contributes in the following ways: First, this paper conducts research on public opinions toward wildlife conservation using natural language processing technique. Second, this paper offers advice to governments and conservationist organizations, helping them utilize social media for protecting wildlife. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Since the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, levels of loneliness have increased among the general population and especially among sexual minorities, such as gay men and other men who have sex with men, who already experienced more problems with social isolation before the pandemic. We analyzed how the disruption of the social network and social support structures by containment measures impact loneliness among gay and other men having sex with men. Our sample consisted of gay and other men having sex with men who had in person communication with family as well as heterosexual friends and homosexual friends before the lockdown (N = 461). Multivariate regression analyses were performed with social provisions (social interaction and reliable alliance) and loneliness as dependent variables. A change from in-person communication with gay peers before the pandemic to remote-only or no communication with gay peers during the pandemic, mediated by change in social integration, was related to an increased feeling of loneliness during the pandemic compared with before the pandemic. There were some unexpected findings, which should be interpreted in the specific social context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. On average, social integration and reliable alliance among MSM increased during the lockdown, even though in-person communication decreased and loneliness increased. Our results show it is critical to maintain a view of social support and social loneliness as lodged within larger social and cultural contexts that ultimately shape the mechanisms behind them. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the forward/reverse causal relationships between belief (risk perception), attitude (judgment), and behavior (acceptance). A traditional view stresses forward causal relationships between the three variables. However, recently, several studies have reported the possibility of reverse causal relationships between them. Based on survey data collected from 1027 Korean/Japanese participants, here we test not only the forward or reverse relationships between these three variables, but also how such causal relationships depend on the trust and country contexts (Korea and Japan in this study). The results showed that, first, not only a general forward causal relationship but also reverse causal relationship exists between belief, attitude, and behavior. Second, there exist the moderated mediation and mediated moderation effect of trust in government and media across two countries. Third, the effects of trust in government and media work significantly overall. However, the patterns of interaction effects differ between two countries. The level of trust in the government influenced the belief and attitude of citizens in Japan more than in Korea. However, the level of trust in the media showed opposite results. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Health literacy (HL) is critical to find, understand and use health information for adopting appropriate health behavior, especially during a pandemic crisis in which people can be exposed to an overwhelming amount of information from different media. To this end, we conducted an online study to first validate the measure of COronaVIrus Disease appeared in 2019 (COVID-19) health literacy (CoHL) and then investigated its relationships with locus of control (LoC), news information search and the adoption of protective behaviors (PBs) during the first lockdown in France. We first showed the good structural and psychometric qualities of the CoHL scale on a 3-dimensional structure: the Critical dimension, the Extraction/Communicative and the Application/Communicative dimension. We then found that CoHL was associated with the adoption of PBs suggesting that people with higher CoHL tended to adopt more PBs during the first lockdown, regardless of their LoC. However, people with low CoHL would be more likely to adopt PBs if they believe that they may get COVID-19 due to the behavior and health conditions of others (high external LoC). The study has implications for the design of public health campaigns for people with inadequate HL and with a different LoC. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022

AB  - Though professional damages in respect of young personal injury victims are recognized in principle by the Dintilhac group, and confirmed by the Court of Cassation in terms of full compensation for damages suffered, the assessment of such professional damages remains difficult, and the source of myriad legal disputes. Assessment of lost future earnings requires a specific approach: As regards the benchmark salary, judges base this on the average or median salary in France, taking into account the social and family environment which may represent a loss of opportunity. The jurisprudence recognizes that the permanent incapacity of the victim entitles them to lifetime compensation, mostly in the form of an annuity. However, while the civil judge considers that the payment of an allowance for disabled adults (AAH) or an educational allowance for disabled children (AEEH) does not interfere with the calculation of lost professional earnings, the administrative judge takes the opposite stance. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - This study aims to examine how covid-19 affect consumer behaviors within gastronomy tourism and the mediating role of destination satisfaction in this relationship. The research data was collected from 812 consumers through questionnaires. The collected data was analyzed through IBM SPSS 25 (Hayes, 2009) and PROCESS v3.4 macro. The study found that the perception of gastronomy tourism has a positive and significant effect on destination satisfaction and consumer behavior and that destination satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on consumer behavior. It was also found that destination satisfaction has a partial mediating role between the perception of gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior. Due to social distancing, the pandemic has greatly affected the interest in gastronomy tourism. The fact that people avoid eating in crowded places has led to a decrease in the interest in gastronomy tourism. As destination satisfaction has a mediating effect between gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior, more emphasis should be put on destination satisfaction in the field of gastronomy tourism. This study answers the critical question of how gastronomy tourism affects consumer behavior and reveals the role of destination satisfaction in this relationship. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To examine how dementia is associated with COVID-19 risk and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, and whether mitigation behaviors mediate the relationship between dementia and COVID-19 risk. Methods/Design: We analyzed 2019 and 2020 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a national prospective cohort study of United States older adults age 65+. Outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing). Results: Among the 3257 older adults in this study, 485 (14.9%) had dementia in 2019 and 98 (3.1%) were COVID-19 positive in 2020. Dementia significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 by 129% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–3.97), and remained elevated after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.90–3.11). Dementia significantly decreased the odds of handwashing by 72% (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17–0.44), which remained lower after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.23–1.21). Dementia was not significantly associated with mask-wearing and social distancing. The relationship between dementia and COVID-19 was primarily mediated by functional impairment, income, and residential setting. Conclusions: Dementia was associated with an increased COVID-19 risk and lower adherence to handwashing among U.S. older adults. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors did not mediate COVID-19 risk by dementia status. For older adults with dementia, COVID-19 risk could be decreased by prioritizing health interventions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The use of disinformation to disrupt the domestic politics of other states has become a staple of contemporary global politics. How these campaigns operate at a microlevel of individual users and network communities, however, remains undertheorized. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze how states leverage existing social media networks strategically for that purpose. Drawing from social network theory, we argue that the spread of disinformation in the digital age is best understood by examining how actors achieve and maintain access to the existing social media networks via a process of cultural keying-mimicking the cultural cues of the target network to camouflage their intentions and attract followers. While this activity is usually limited in scale and scope, it may be amplified to seize on critical domestic and international events. To demonstrate these arguments, we examine the Twitter behavior of the Kremlin-linked news outlets RT and Sputnik during and after the 2017 French presidential election. We first analyze their presence and salience in a network of accounts interested in French politics. We then use structural topic modeling to identify thematic overlap between the outlets and our panel of users. Our analysis suggests that Kremlin-linked outlets are indeed active in local networks and repeatedly key on salient themes such as Islamophobia and Euroscepticism to blend in. © 2022 The Author(s) (2022).

AB  - Background: Despite substantial resources deployed to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission, controlling the COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge. New variants of the virus are frequently emerging leading to new waves of infection and re-introduction of control measures. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of containment strategies implemented in the early phase of the pandemic. Methods: Real-world data for COVID-19 cases was retrieved for the period Jan 1 to May 1, 2020 from a number of different sources, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Facebook, Epidemic Forecasting and Google Mobility Reports. We analyzed data for 18 countries/regions that deployed containment strategies such as travel restrictions, lockdowns, stay-at-home requests, school/public events closure, social distancing, and exposure history information management (digital contact tracing, DCT). Primary outcome measure was the change in the number of new cases over 30 days before and after deployment of a control measure. We also compared the effectiveness of centralized versus decentralized DCT. Time series data for COVID-19 were analyzed using Mann-Kendall (M-K) trend tests to investigate the impact of these measures on changes in the number of new cases. The rate of change in the number of new cases was compared using M-K z-values and Sen's slope. Results: In spite of the widespread implementation of conventional strategies such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing, school closures, and stay-at-home requests, analysis revealed that these measures could not prevent the spread of the virus. However, countries which adopted DCT with centralized data storage were more likely to contain the spread. Conclusions: Centralized DCT was more effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. Early implementation of centralized DCT should be considered in future outbreaks. However, challenges such as public acceptance, data security and privacy concerns will need to be addressed. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: Breakthroughs in stem cell research (SCR) and regenerative medicine (RM) have attracted significant public attention worldwide. Simultaneously, scientific communities and science policies have tried to establish appropriate governance of SCR and RM. In this context, effective communication between scientific communities and the public is regarded as a key factor. However, the diversity of public attitudes and interests has not been sufficiently examined, especially the differences across countries. Methods: We conducted an international comparison of public attitudes toward SCR and RM. We circulated an internet questionnaire among people in six countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, the UK, Germany, and France. We collected 100 valid responses from each country, and a total of 600 responses were obtained. Results: Our key findings are the diversity of interests in RM, which can be expressed as user pragmatism, governance and handling of RM, risk, and benefit, and scientific interests. The priority of interests varied across the six countries, and the variations may be influenced by the political, social, cultural, and media contexts of SCR and RM in each country. Conclusion: The implications can contribute to a deeper understanding of the diversity of public attitudes, and bring about an appropriate examination of a wide range of ethical and social concerns of SCR and RM in global contexts. © 2022 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine

AB  - Objectives: Earlier initiation of alcohol use and problematic drinking among adolescents are linked with adverse health outcomes. Exposure to alcohol advertisements is associated with drinking among adolescents, but the association between the attitudes toward alcohol advertisements and drinking behaviors is understudied. We evaluated the association between attitudes towards alcohol advertisements and initiation of alcohol use among adolescent boys. Methods: Adolescent boys from urban and Appalachian Ohio enrolled in a prospective study and reported whether they had ever consumed alcohol or been drunk at baseline (N = 1220; ages 11–16 years) and at the 24-month follow up (N = 891). Attitudes toward alcohol advertisements were measured at baseline following a brief advertisement viewing activity. Adjusted logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between attitudes toward advertisements and initiating alcohol use or drunkenness at the 24-month follow-up. Results: Adolescent boys reporting any positive attitudes toward alcohol advertisements had higher odds of initiating alcohol use (aOR = 2.00, 95% CI [1.16, 3.44]), and attitudes were marginally associated with incident drunkenness (aOR = 2.20, 95% CI [0.94, 5.12]). Increasing age, higher household income, ever use of tobacco, and frequency of visiting alcohol retailers were also associated with greater odds of incident alcohol use and/or drunkenness. Conclusions: Attitudes toward alcohol advertisements at baseline were associated with alcohol drinking behaviors 24-months later among adolescent boys. Results highlight the importance of media literacy interventions targeted to adolescents. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Objectives: Most SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies have focussed on adults and high-risk populations, and little is known about young adults. The objective of the present study was to provide evidence on the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among young adults in Germany and to explore determinants associated with seropositivity in general and, specifically, with previously undetected infections. Study design: This was a population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study. Methods: In November 2020, a population-based study on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in young adults (aged 18–30 years) was conducted in a large German city. Serum samples were obtained to analyse the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) of seropositivity and of previously undetected infections in relation to different determinants were calculated. Results: Among 2186 participants, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 72 individuals, equalling a test performance-adjusted seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4–4.0). Based on reported COVID-19 cases to the public health authority, a moderate underascertainment rate of 1.7 was calculated. Seropositivity was higher among individuals who sought COVID-19-related information from social media (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.2–3.1), and undetected COVID-19 infections were more prevalent among men and those not adhering to social distancing. Conclusions: The results show a substantial underascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections among young adults and indicate that seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported COVID-19 prevalence based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany. Preventive efforts should consider the heterogeneity of risk profiles among the young adult population. © 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health

AB  - How do slums shape the economic and health dynamics of pandemics? A difference-in-differences analysis using millions of mobile phones in Brazil shows that residents of overcrowded slums engaged in less social distancing after the outbreak of Covid-19. We develop and calibrate a choice-theoretic equilibrium model in which individuals are heterogeneous in income and some people live in high-density slums. Slum residents account for a disproportionately high number of infections and deaths and, without slums, deaths increase in non-slum neighborhoods. Policy analysis of reallocation of medical resources, lockdowns and cash transfers produce heterogeneous effects across groups. Policy simulations indicate that: reallocating medical resources cuts deaths and raises output and the welfare of both groups; mild lockdowns favor slum individuals by mitigating the demand for hospital beds, whereas strict confinements mostly delay the evolution of the pandemic; and cash transfers benefit slum residents to the detriment of others, highlighting important distributional effects. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This study evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by U.S. states, including social distancing, financial assistance, and vaccination policies. We propose a time-varying parameter multilevel dynamic factor model (TVP-MDFM) to improve the model's accuracy for evaluating the dynamic policy effect. The estimation is based on the Bayesian shrinkage method jointly with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines model selection and parameter estimation into the same iterative sampling process. The advantages and reliability of the TVP-MDFM are explored using simulation studies and robustness tests. The main empirical results highlight that the direct causal effect of the social distancing policy is more significant than the indirect effect mediated through human behavior. We also find income heterogeneity in financial assistance policies. Moreover, we provide evidence that banning vaccination certification by legislation is a stronger driver of the new case rate than executive orders during the Omicron dominance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: This study investigated how adults in the United Kingdom perceived their arts and cultural engagement to facilitate social connectedness over two phases in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Study design: The study used the HEartS Survey, a newly designed online survey tool to capture arts engagement in the United Kingdom and its associations with social and mental well-being, over two phases in 2020: March to May (Phase 1) and October (Phase 2). Methods: Qualitative data were provided at both phases by 581 respondents, who identified which arts and cultural activity they felt most connected them to others and how during the last month. Results: Thematic analysis revealed that, at both phases, arts and cultural engagement was perceived to facilitate social connectedness through four pathways that were also identified prepandemic: social opportunities, sharing, feelings of commonality and belonging and collective understanding. The subthemes shed light on specific ways that respondents used the arts during the pandemic to connect with others, including using the arts: as a catalyst for conversations, to maintain, reinstate or strengthen relationships during social distancing and to facilitate social interactions (Theme 1); to bring people together through shared experiences and sharing of art (Theme 2); to elicit feelings of direct and indirect proximity to others, to connect people with common interests, to feel a sense of belonging to something and to feel part of a collective ‘COVID-19 experience’ or to feel collectively distracted from the pandemic (Theme 3); and to learn from and about other people and to relate to others (Theme 4). The activity most frequently cited as connecting was watching a film or drama, followed by listening to recorded music. Conclusions: Engagement in arts and cultural activities supported feelings of social connection among adults in the United Kingdom over two phases in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of access to the arts and culture to support social connectedness. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Whereas politicians broker peace deals, it falls to the public to embrace peace and help sustain it. The legacy of conflicts can make it difficult for people to support reconciling and reintegrating with former enemies. Here we create a five-minute media intervention from interviews we conducted with Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) ex-combatants in a Colombian demobilization camp and non-FARC Colombians in neighbouring communities. We show that exposure to the media intervention humanizes FARC ex-combatants and increases support for peace and reintegration. These effects persisted at least three months post-exposure, were replicated in an independent sample of non-FARC Colombians and affected both attitudes (for example, support for reintegration policies) and behaviour (for example, donations to organizations supporting ex-combatants). As predicted, the intervention’s effects were mediated by changing conflict-associated cognitions—reducing the belief that ex-combatants are unwilling and unable to change—beyond affective pathways (for example, increased empathy or reduced prejudice). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward the overweight, can lead to discriminatory practices, as well as increase overweight individuals' vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. We propose that a nostalgia induction can attenuate weight stigma. Participants identified an overweight individual, before writing about an interpersonal encounter with that individual, characterized by either central (e.g., “keepsakes” and “childhood”) or peripheral (e.g., “wishing” and “daydreaming”) features of the construct “nostalgia.” Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported more positive feelings and beliefs toward overweight individuals in general. Moreover, nostalgia influenced behavior: Nostalgic (vs. control) participants reduced their social distance when anticipating an interaction with an overweight individual. The effect of nostalgia on all three outcomes (i.e., positive feelings, beliefs, and behavior) was mediated by greater social connectedness, which in turn was associated with higher inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for recruitment of adults and children into clinical research. The sudden onset of stay-at-home orders and social distancing enacted in much of the United States created sudden barriers for researchers to recruit participants in-person. Recognizing the critical need to understand the impact of COVID-19 on children and families in real time, studies required an alternative approach. The present study sought to develop methods and establish the feasibility of utilizing Facebook's targeted advertising to enroll schoolaged children and their parents for a study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families. This study used an 8 week pay-per-click advertisement approach via Facebook for research recruitment. Parents of children age 8 to 17 were invited and asked to include their child. Standardized measures were included for parents and children. Zip code targeting was used to increase diversity in participants. The ad campaign reached 213,120, yielding 3563 clicks, 684 parent participants, 494 child participants and a 26% conversion rate over eight weeks. The cost-per-click was $0.64, and cost-per-participant was $3.30 and $4.60 for parents and children, respectively. This nationwide study successfully used social media to recruit a robust nationwide sample of parent-child dyads during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media recruitment mitigated typical time and engagement barriers for participants while also circumventing social and physical distancing orders due to the pandemic which allowed for real time assessment of the pandemic's effects on families. Future consideration should be given.to social media as a research recruitment methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Acknowledging the unique challenges of the socially stigmatized industry and the substantial but varying impact of COVID-19 on business, this study examined how corporate social responsibility (CSR) fit influences public attitudinal and behavioral responses. This study found that low (high) CSR fit generated a higher level of public-serving motive (firm-serving motive) than high (low) fit CSR. The fit effect on public-serving motives was changed by the valence of the COVID-19 impact (negative vs. positive) on the financial performance. This study also found that the fit affects attitudinal and behavioral intentions (word of mouth) mediated via public-serving motives, moderated by the valence of the pandemic impact. The findings hold implications for the stigmatized industry companies’ CSR initiatives in the context of the unexpected crisis, like the pandemic. © 2022

AB  - Background: The literature demonstrated a positive impact of medication therapy management (MTM) services provided by the pharmacists to improve the overall health outcomes. Nevertheless, limited data is available with regard to MTM service implementation by community pharmacists and its associated factors in Jordan. Objective: To evaluate community pharmacists’ knowledge, attitude and practice of MTM service and to explore the challenges and barriers for its implementation. Methods: The present cross-sectional study utilized a validated online survey which was filled by community pharmacists in different areas across Jordan. In addition to the socio-demographic variables, the study questionnaire evaluated pharmacists’ knowledge and attitudes towards MTM service, extent of MTM implementation and its associated challenges and barriers. Results: A total of 250 pharmacists completed the survey. The study pharmacists showed moderate knowledge level (median of the total knowledge score = 6 (4–7) out of 10) and positive attitude (median of the attitude score was 23 (19–26) out of 30) towards MTM services. The participating pharmacists recognized performing or obtaining necessary assessments of patient's health status as the most frequently provided MTM service (84.8%), while the least one was documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to other healthcare providers (62%). Furthermore, collecting patient-related information was the most commonly recognized challenge to MTM service provision (36.8%), followed by referring the patient to a physician or consultant (36%) and collaboration with them (35.6%). The most reported barrier was negative physician attitudes (40.4%), followed by the lack of training on MTM provision (38.4%), and lack of adequate support staff (37.2%). Conclusion: Efforts are needed to enhance collaboration between pharmacists and other health care professional, to develop documentation systems that would preserve and facilitate access to patient information, and to implement appropriate training programs which aim to overcome the challenges and barriers for MTM implementation. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: The pharmacovigilance system is playing a vital role in the process of patient safety through reporting of ADRs and other drug-related problems. Although, the. Pharmacovigilance system is well established in other Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC). In Kingdom of Bahrain, the Pharmacovigilance system is still in its early stages. Establishing a successful Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain requires a collective effort from various stakeholders such as the ministry of health and the National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA). Aim: To assess the current status of the Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain and the feasibility of its development. Objectives: To investigate the current Pharmacovigilance activities in Bahrain, to explore the attitude / knowledge of healthcare providers towards PV systems and to identify the limitations, and barriers of the PV system in Bahrain. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study utilising an online survey composed of 24 questions. It was distributed to pharmacists, physicians, and nurses working at government and private hospitals in Bahrain through emails and social media. In addition, a telephone interview was performed with a pharmacist working for NHRA in Bahrain. Ethics approval was prior to commencing the study. Results: More than half of the respondents (69.8%) did not report any ADRs so far in their practice, whereas 30.2% had done so. A total of 95.8% of those who have never reported before were willing to report in the future. Participants who received training regarding reporting ADRs reported lower positive attitudes (3.3 ± 0.8 vs 3.6 ± 0.6). In addition, the participants were more knowledgeable about the ADRs reporting process than the PV system. The results showed the absence of an active PV program. The activity of PV in Bahrain is limited to receiving notifications and periodic safety update records from manufactures or the GHC. Conclusion: Despite the average level of knowledge of healthcare providers towards the PV system, the results indicated a negative attitude. Moreover, some barriers were reported. Establishing a specialised PV centre is the next step to improve the status of PV system in Bahrain. © 2022

AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti-immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right-Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Caregiving is associated with various burdens for family caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures implemented to restrict public life, such as social distancing and the closure of services and educational institutions, add further challenges. Little is known about how they are perceived by family caregivers. Based on an analysis of German social media posts, the aim of this study was to explore the additional strains family caregivers experience during the pandemic. The websites of three social media services were searched using the respective search engines provided by the websites. Data from a 10-month period (March to December 2020) were identified and examined. A total of 237 publicly available posts were included in the analysis. Seven main categories were identified using a thematic approach: care and support, deterioration of the condition of the person being cared for, psychological challenges, financial challenges, infection control, access to protective equipment, and acknowledgement of family caregivers. Family caregivers are affected by additional burdens during the pandemic, which makes the development of support and relief services tailored to this population group necessary. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The media plays a vital role in addressing the issues of society through audiovisual means that contribute to the transmission of media messages. Drama contributes to implement positive values or negative attitudes in people's minds towards various societal issues. The negative stereotypes shaped by drama about persons with disabilities (PWDs) have attracted the attention of the researchers. Therefore, Arabic drama is required to present a true portrait of PWDs that reflects their reality without exaggeration or discrimination. It is also required to re-correct the stereotyped image that has been formed in society towards PWDs. Aims: This literature research was conducted to review and analyze research and theses that presented PWDs in Arabic drama. The research sought to reveal the stereotypical behavior of PWDs in Arabic drama, categories of disability, and drama genres that presented PWDs. Methods and procedures: This research included 17 peer-reviewed research and thesis obtained from Arab and international databases from 2002 to 2022. The content analysis card was used to achieve the aims of this research. Outcomes and results: The findings of the literature review indicated that the majority of Arab dramas presented negative stereotypes of PWDs. The results also showed that intellectual disability, visual impairment, and physical disabilities were the most dominant in Arabic movies and television series. Conclusions and implications: Arabic drama and media were unable to present accurate representations of PWDs. They appeared in a distorted and satirical way in movies and television series. Perhaps, these negative stereotypes emerged from the prevailing popular cultures in the Arab countries that produce these movies and series. It is thus necessary to remove these stereotypes expressed in drama to enhance awareness and societal inclusion in the Arab culture and countries. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - One of the key strategies to stop the increase of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases is vaccines. The uncertainty and refusal of Filipinos to get the COVID-19 vaccine will be a crucial barrier to achieve the immunization coverage required for population protection. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the knowledge and attitude of the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology students and faculty and staff towards the COVID-19 vaccine. A descriptive study approach and total sampling were adopted. A questionnaire was constructed to accumulate data on the respondents' profile, knowledge, attitude and source of information about the vaccine for COVID-19. Informed consent and permission to conduct were acquired. Various statistical tools were used to analyze the data. The respondents were knowledgeable and had positive attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Their primary source of information was from social media on the internet and television. There is a positive association between their attitude and knowledge of the COVID-19 vaccine, which means that they are closer to having a positive attitude when they are knowledgeable about the COVID-19 vaccine. Therefore, health education campaigns to increase their knowledge or awareness about the COVID-19 vaccine should encourage them to receive a COVID-19 vaccine shot. © 2022, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - The change of social interaction pattern amidst the implementation of social distancing policies during the pandemic had altered the way individuals evaluated themselves and their social environment, including the way they develop perceived social support (PSS) that would lead to another change in the way they develop their satisfaction with life (SWL). This might have affected the development of their psychological wellbeing (PWB), which is highly contingent upon psychosocial constructs. Another variable that might alter the formation of PWB is the sense that we matter to others (Mattering), which was also altered by the limitation of in-person interactions. We purposively recruited 403 Malaysian urban adults affected by the social distancing policies by having to study or work from home, to respond to our survey in order to test the hypothesis that the SWL would fully mediate the association between PSS and PWB among individuals with higher levels of mattering. The results of the bootstrap analysis with 5,000 samples and 95% confident interval supported our hypothesis, with a caveat that the mediation of SWL also occurred among individuals with moderate levels of mattering. PSS was still a significant predictor of PWB when controlling for mattering and SWL, which indicated that the mediation of SWL was only partially occurred. © 2022, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - Numerous preventive measures of social distancing and lockdowns have been imposed by governments and health authorities in order to reduce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. This, in turn, has significantly impacted upon physical activity levels and other healthy habits in different countries around the globe, which may precipitate several negative sequalae on the health of the world population. Here, we briefly discuss the current scientific evidence on the subject and propose relevant recommendations moving forwards. © 2022 by Author/s and Licensed by Modestum.

AB  - This article examines why an aboveground pink economy has emerged in mainland China, where equal rights for gay people are repressed and public attitudes toward homosexuality are overwhelmingly negative. Drawing on interviews, supplemented with a minimal amount of media data, this article demonstrates that in China there was a group of gay people wishing to fulfill needs mainstream businesses disregard and that such consumer needs necessitate China’s pink sector. More importantly, the state set the stage for the nascent sector to emerge: Government policies triggered a surge in funding resources and technology infrastructure upgrades that laid the material foundations for pink entrepreneurship. Despite being born in an institutional void, pink ventures employed legitimizing strategies to hedge against risk and uncertainty, thereby consolidating this new market. China’s pink economy developed independently of the influence of the gay movement and even expanded, as never before, at the low ebb of the movement. This research gives credence to the notion that an aboveground pink economy could precede political rights but, unlike American scholarship, questions a similar causal relationship between the two in the Chinese context. © 2022 Eastern Sociological Society.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups. Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively. Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6–2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35–0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59). Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The present research applied the social identity approach to examine how the perceived legitimacy of weight-based discrimination among ingroup members influences their experience of their higher-weight identity and their well-being, and the conditions under which this occurs. Specifically, we investigated whether portraying weight-based discrimination as legitimate, as opposed to illegitimate, influenced higher-weight individuals’ group identification, intentions to engage in collective action on behalf of their group, and their body satisfaction and self-esteem. The moderating role of group boundary permeability and the mediating role of group identification were also examined. North American adults with a self-reported BMI of or above 30 (N = 327) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: weight-based discrimination that was portrayed as legitimate or illegitimate by other ingroup members. Results revealed that portraying weight-based discrimination as being perceived as legitimate (versus illegitimate) among ingroup members significantly reduced group identification, but only among those who perceived their group's boundaries to be more permeable. For this particular group, reduced identification predicted, in turn, lower collective action intentions, body satisfaction, and self-esteem. This study highlights the damaging effect of legitimized discrimination for ingroup identification and the downstream consequences for collective action and well-being. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the bias of Twitter as an agenda-setter during COVID-19. Specifically, we analyze the agenda-setting function of Twitter (Study 1) and characteristics of information disseminators on Twitter, agenda-builders (Study 2), related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1, we examined rank correlations between the media agendas on COVID-19 and public agendas. The results indicated that Twitter agendas resonate with those who have liberal tendencies. In Study 2, we used data from the Internet survey to identify the political attitudes of agenda-builders who tweet or retweet on COVID-19. The results of the model analyses indicated that people with liberal tendencies, motivated by their political attitude, created original tweets, and some of those tweets were then retweeted by flaming-oriented people driven by a sense of justice. This seems to be how information about COVID-19 spreads on Twitter in Japan. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Online social platforms or social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have become popular platforms for a public discussion about social topics. Recent studies show that there is a growing tendency for people to talk about COVID-19 pandemic in these online channels. The rapid growth of the infected cases by COVID-19 pandemic makes a lots of anxiety and fear among people. With the recent released of Pfizer vaccine, people start posting a lot of rumors regarding the safety concerns of the vaccine, especially among the elderly people. The aim of this study is to bring out the fact that tweets containing all pertinent details about the COVID-19 vaccine and provides an analysis and understanding of users emotions regarding the recent release of COVID-19 vaccine. This study starts with the collection of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine and then cleaning the dataset from redundant tweets. In this study, we use Twitter API and Web Scraping techniques to obtain a sample of 50,000 tweets talking about COVID-19 vaccine.Further, The analysis of users emotions is achieved by manually labeling and classifying the tweets to either positive or negative. Then, a deep learning based model is used to train the data and classify the people opinion about COVID-19 vaccine. The experimental results illustrate that high percentage of people have shown a positive attitude towards COVID1-19 vaccine. The proposed method is validated over Twitter datasets and the results also demonstrate that use of deep learning classifier can successfully improve the accuracy of people emotions analysis with an accuracy up to 98% for training set and the accuracy for testing set is 73%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and efforts to contain it have substantially affected the daily lives of most of the world's population. Objective: We describe the impact of the first COVID-19 wave and associated social restrictions on the mental health of a large adult population. Methods: We performed a cohort study nested in a prospective randomized clinical trial, comparing responses during the first COVID-19 wave to previous responses. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) of the population moving up one severity category on validated instruments used to measure stress (PSS-10), anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Responses were linked to inpatient and outpatient ICD-10 codes from registries. Models were adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, and pre-existing diagnoses of mental illness. Results: Of 63,848 invited participants, 42,253 (66%) responded. The median age was 60 (inter-quartile range 53–68) and 19,032 (45%) were male. Responses during the first wave of COVID-19 did not suggest increased stress (OR 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93–1.01; p = 0.28) or anxiety (OR 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.05; p = 0.61), but were associated with decreased depression (OR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85–0.93, p < 0.0001) and increased satisfaction with life (OR 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08–1.16, p < 0.0001). A secondary analysis of repeated measures data showed similar results. Conclusions: Social restrictions were sufficient to contain the pandemic but did not negatively impact validated measures of mental illness or psychiatric well-being. However, responses to individual questions showed signs of fear and stress. This may represent a normal, rather than pathological, population response to a stressful situation. © 2022 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.

AB  - This study investigated whether people’s personal belief in a just world (BJW) is linked to their willingness to physically distance themselves from others during the COVID-19 pandemic. Past research found personal BJW to be positively related to prosocial behavior, justice striving, and lower risk perceptions. If social distancing reflects a concern for others, high personal BJW should predict increased interest in social distancing. If social distancing reflects a concern for one’s personal risk, high personal BJW should predict decreased interest in social distancing. Results of a pre-registered internet-based study from Germany (N = 361) indicated that the higher people’s personal BJW, the more they generally practiced social distancing. This association still occurred when controlling for empathy, another significant predictor of social distancing. There were no mediation effects of empathy and risk perception. The findings extend knowledge on the correlates of social distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic which could be used to increase compliance among citizens. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - September 11th was a turning point in the understanding of terrorism and radicalization. The Internet has provided an instrumental change regarding how terrorists communicate and spread their propaganda, proving a cause of concern for counterterrorism units. The increased use of social networking platforms has provided a significant change in the process of self-radicalization, with younger generations at greater risk. The aim of the project was to study the relationship between social media and self-radicalization among college and university students. A sample of 499 participants was recruited throughout Amazon Mechanical Turk and social media platforms. Measures on emotional intelligence, psychological involvement on social media, attitudes toward terrorism, and political violence, and loneliness were gathered. Results showed that individuals holding a university degree—especially young men—were more at risk of endorzing positive attitudes toward political violence and terrorism, and, therefore, more at risk of being radicalized. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Aim: To test (1) if there was a change in self-reported lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine use by birth cohort and (2) if the extent of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was associated with the proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem. Design: Observational study using seven waves of repeated cross-sectional nationally representative household surveys between 2001 and 2019. Setting: Australia. Participants: Participants were from three birth cohorts: 1951–60 (age 68–77 at the 2019 survey; n = 29 458; 55% female), 1961–1970 (age 58–67; n = 29 859; 57% female) and 1971–1980 (age 48–57; n = 28 758; 59% female). Data were weighted to align the sample to the Australian population. Measurements: Past year meth/amphetamine use; under-reporting of lifetime meth/amphetamine use in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum (operationalised as the difference between self-reported lifetime prevalence in 2001 and that of each subsequent year); proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum. Under-reporting was regressed on the proportion of people holding negative attitude towards meth/amphetamine. Survey year and birth cohort were adjusted for. Findings: Between 2001 and 2019, the lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine decreased from 6.1% (95% CI = 5.3–6.9) to 1.7% (95% CI = 1.2–2.2) in the 1951–1960 birth cohort (p < 0.001), from 13.0% (95% CI = 12.0–14.1) to 4.4% (95% CI = 3.7–5.2) in the 1961–1970 birth cohort (p < 0.001) and from 21.4% (95% CI = 19.9–22.9) to 11.2% (95% CI = 10.0–12.4) in the 1971–1980 birth cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion who nominated meth/amphetamine as a ‘drug problem’ increased significantly in all three cohorts (all p < 0.001) and the degree of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was significantly associated with proportion of people who nominated meth/amphetamine as the ‘drug problem’ (b = 0.09, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In Australia, the actual prevalence of lifetime meth/amphetamine use may be two- to fourfold higher than that estimated in the most recent national household surveys (2019). The level of under-reporting is strongly associated with increasing negative attitudes towards methylamphetamine and d-amphetamine use over the same period. © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction.

AB  - As the world's largest consumer group, Generation Z's (Gen Z) influence and purchase ability facilitate the upgrading of consumption. This study investigated a new phenomenon: food favorability, that is, customer preference for diet and food, using a mixed-methods approach in three studies. Taking Chinese Gen Z as an example, Study 1 developed a conceptual model of food favorability among Gen Z based on grounded theory with dish evaluation, dietary choice, marketing innovation, and service quality as the core categories. Study 2 underwent a rigorous scale development by establishing a food favorability scale to measure Gen Z's preference for diet and food. Using this scale, Study 3 further confirmed the positive effect of Gen Z's food favorability on purchase intention, when food preference played a mediating role in this process. Moreover, social distance promoted the positive prediction of food favorability on preference. This study systematically constructs the concept of Gen Z's food favorability, expanding the “theoretical territory” of their consumption characteristics. Additionally, the theoretical basis of “intervention measures” is provided for the sustainable tourism and catering industries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the curvilinear relationships between challenge stressors, service-oriented OCB, and service sabotage behavior. We further predicted that job satisfaction will nonlinearly mediate, and psychological capital will moderate, these relationships. Using a three-wave design, data was collected from 320 Thai hotel employees. Consistent with our prediction, challenge stressors had an inverted U-shaped relationship with service-oriented OCB and a U-shaped relationship with service sabotage behavior. Furthermore, job satisfaction nonlinearly mediated these relationships. Additionally, when psychological capital was low (versus high), the curvilinear relationships were more pronounced. The findings enhance the current understanding of the conditions under which different levels of challenge stressors bolster or hinder work behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Limitations and avenues for further research are outlined. © 2021

AB  - Artificial intelligence technology has been increasingly applied in the hospitality and tourism industry, and it is a matter of concern how to increase customer adoption of AI applications in service encounters. This study examines how cuteness of AI applications interacts with the type of service task (emotional or knowledge-based) in their influence on customers' willingness to use the application. Hypotheses were tested using four experiments in different interactive contexts. It was found that customers were more willing to adopt AI applications with high perceived cuteness to perform emotional tasks, and social distance played a mediating role; conversely, customers preferred AI applications with low perceived cuteness to perform knowledge-based tasks, and here performance expectancy mediated the relationship between perceived cuteness and customers’ willingness to use the application. The findings advance the theories of customer adoption by revealing and differentiating the “cuteness effect” within different service types. © 2021

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the residency application and interview process. Due to social distancing concerns, residency programs have had to virtually showcase their program to applicants, many utilizing social media. Similarly, applicants have had to devise novel ways of assessing “goodness of fit”, one of the top factor's applicants use when ranking programs (1). Whether or not these attempts made an impact on an applicant's decision-making process has yet to be determined. Materials and Methods: Residency candidates interviewing for a diagnostic and/or interventional radiology residency position at our institution completed an online survey. The goal of the survey was to assess the potential influence of virtual interviews, social media, and virtual events on an applicant's decision to apply to, interview at, and rank residency programs. Results: 78/156 (50%) candidates completed the survey. Thirty-five percent reported applying to more programs and 58% reported accepting more interviews than they would have if interviews were not virtual. Forty-two percent reported that social media played a vital role during the application season and 71% reported using social media to learn more about the program. Sixty-nine percent attended a virtual open house, 57% of whom reported that attending the open house influenced their decision to apply to a program. Sixty-three percent reported that attending a virtual reception influenced a program's ranking. Conclusion: Social media has had a growing role in the medical community, and the COVID-19 pandemic likely accelerated an inevitable shift in residency program “branding” and how applicants perceive overall “goodness of fit”. © 2021 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - During the last decades the Nordic media model has been challenged by neoliberal policy and welfare retrenchment. This study asks about the extent to which the values, functions and institutions of the “media welfare state” are supported by the adult Swedish citizenry, despite political mobilization against it. Drawing on a national survey (n = 2003) this study shows that the media welfare state is generally well-supported by the population. Using exploratory statistical analysis, we identify a media welfare state of mind. While widespread in the population, this attitudinal constellation is more common in older segments of the population, in the working-class, and by those who frequently use and trust public service media. The main conclusion is that support for the media welfare state primarily can be explained by political attitudes, where left-leaning and GAL-oriented individuals are more positive than people holding right-wing and TAN-attitudes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Culturally diverse schools contribute to adolescents’ intergroup relations. Complex and inclusive social identities are mechanisms that can explain the link between structural school cultural diversity (i.e., proportion of students of immigrant descent and the number of different ethnic groups) and positive intergroup relations. We expected that similar mechanisms might be at play linking cultural diversity approaches in schools with adolescents’ intergroup relations. Aim: We examined the link between two sub-dimensions of cultural diversity approaches (i.e., equal treatment; heritage and intercultural learning) and adolescents’ prosocial intentions and behaviour towards refugee youth. Then, we explored the mediating role of identity inclusiveness (i.e., perceived similarity of the self with others). Sample and methods: We sampled culturally diverse eighth grade adolescents from 54 classrooms in Berlin (N = 503, Mage = 13.76 years, 50.6% female). Surveys measured perceived cultural diversity norms, adolescents’ perceived identity inclusiveness with refugee youth, prosocial intentions to support refugee youth, and willingness to donate to a project for refugee youth. Results: Multilevel models revealed that adolescents’ perception of heritage and intercultural learning predicted adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, but not their willingness to donate. Equal treatment was not a significant predictor of adolescents’ prosocial intentions towards refugee youth, or their willingness to donate. Identity inclusiveness did not mediate the relation between cultural diversity approaches and prosocial intentions. However, identity inclusiveness did positively relate adolescents’ prosocial intentions and willingness to donate. Conclusions: We conclude that culturally diverse schools that engage in heritage and intercultural learning might help to promote positive relations between local and refugee youth in schools and society. Fostering inclusive identities may enhance local adolescent’s prosocial intention and behaviour. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Acceptance of cultural differences can contribute to diversity. However, naïve realism—the conviction that one’s views are objective whereas others’ are biased—might hinder intercultural coexistence. We tested, in three experimental studies, whether a cognitive strategy based on raising awareness of the naïve realism, without any reference to culture and free of emotional involvement, can have a beneficial effect on cultural acceptance. Results revealed that participants showed more acceptance of cultural differences once they were aware of this bias (Study 1). The intervention had an indirect effect on acceptance via openness, especially for participants higher in prejudice (Study 2). Participants aware of this bias could not maintain an enhanced self-view, which mediated the effect of the manipulation on acceptance (Study 3). These findings suggest that strategies based on “cold” cognition, without an explicit emphasis on culture, might be beneficial for increasing the acceptance of cultural differences in an era of xenophobia. © 2021 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.

AB  - Responsible gambling (RG) tools are globally widespread; they aim to prevent or decrease the harm caused by gambling. However, existing research suggests that several included features do not decrease gambling or significantly reduce the subsequent harm. Most of the previous studies have used gambling data to understand the changes in gambling behavior. However, the literature lacks research regarding gamblers’ experience and perception of RG tools, which may provide insight into increasing the usage and effectiveness of RG tools. This mixed-methods study aimed to explore gamblers’ perception of their risk assessment in the RG tool Playscan regarding developing harmful gambling problems. Overall, 757 participants rated the perceived accuracy of their risk assessment and their perception of the overall RG tool that conducted the assessment. Participants were also allowed to leave a comment providing feedback, which was analyzed using thematic analysis. Quantitative data was analyzed using logistic regression and structural equation modeling. Qualitative analyses revealed that most of the participants were pleased with the risk assessment and found it helpful. Moderated mediation analysis showed that participants’ assessment agreement partially mediated the association between expressing a negative view and their general view of Playscan. These results highlight the need to decrease the level of disagreement for promoting a better general view of RG tools to potentially increase their usage and effectiveness. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This study examined whether stressful life events were associated with weight loss, central adiposity, and health behavior changes of African American breast cancer survivors (AABCS) participating in a weight loss intervention. Methods: We conducted a secondary-data analyses of Moving Forward, a weight loss efficacy trial for AABCS conducted in 2011–2014. Two-hundred forty-six eligible women were randomized to a 6-month interventionist-guided (IG) or self-guided (SG) weight loss intervention. Data was collected on height, weight, self-reported diet, and self-reported physical activity. Stress (e.g., financial, legal, employment, relationships, safety, prejudice) was measured using an abbreviated version of the Crisis in Family Systems (CRISYS) urban life stress measure. Generalized linear models stratified by group examined the degree to which stress was associated with weight loss or changes in central adiposity, physical activity, and diet during the intervention (Months 1–6) or maintenance (Months 7 to 12) phases. Results: Participants reported a median of 3.0 life stressors (range 0 to 22) mostly relating to relationships, safety concerns, and financial problems. In the IG group during the intervention phase, exposure to life stressors was not associated with weight loss (p = 0.15) or change in central adiposity (p = 0.69), physical activity (p = 0.15), or diet (p = 0.26). We found similar associations for the maintenance phase and in the SG group. Conclusion/Implications: Despite facing stress across a myriad of domains (e.g., relationships, safety, finances), AABCS were successful at initiating and maintaining behaviors to achieve weight loss, reductions in central adiposity, and behavioral changes. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted that include more strategies to address the challenges that AABCS face, to determine whether AABCS in particular might benefit from interventions that address barriers (e.g., stress management) to weight loss. Such strategies are critical for improving quality of life and lowering the risk of cancer recurrence. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We examined how Muslims are depicted in connection with Islamist terrorism and to what extent journalists use undifferentiated coverage – that actively links Muslims to terrorism – and differentiated coverage that actively differentiates Muslims from terrorism. Drawing from research in journalism studies and from terror management theory, we examined media-specific and event-specific predictors using a quantitative content analysis (12 quality/tabloid newspapers from three countries, N = 1071 articles). Results reveal that undifferentiated coverage occurs in almost every other article. Differentiation occurs much less. Tabloids use undifferentiated and differentiated coverage in fact-oriented and opinion-oriented articles. Quality news only do so in opinion-oriented articles. Proximity of a terror event resulted in more undifferentiated and less differentiated coverage. Results have important implications for journalism practice, terrorism research and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Social identity exploration is a process whereby individuals actively seek information about their group membership and show efforts to understand its meaning. Developmental theory argues that exploration-based ingroup commitment is the basis for outgroup positivity. We tested this notion in relation to national identity and attitudes towards immigrants. The results of five experimental studies among German adolescents and early adults (N = 1,146; 16–25 years) and one internal meta-analysis suggest that the positive identification–prejudice link is weaker when participants are instructed to explore the meaning of their identity (Study 1). This is not mediated via self-uncertainty (Study 2), but via a reduction in intergroup threat (Study 3) and an increase in deprovincialization (Study 4). In addition, identity exploration enabled strong identifiers to oppose descriptive ingroup norms (Study 5). We conclude that identity exploration can contribute to a further understanding of the identification–prejudice link. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study has two main objectives. The first aim is to adapt the social distancing scale (SDS) into Turkish. The second aim is to test the mediating roles of depression, anxiety, and stress on the relationship between social distance and psychological resilience. The sampling method of the study was revised as the snowball sampling. The study surveyed 843 people (481 female and 362 male) between the ages of 18 and 70 (average age 31.95) living in 51 different cities if Turkey. In the study, back-translation method was used to prepare the SDS-Turkish version. Confirmatory factor analysis results for the study showed that the single-dimension structure fits very well, as in the original form. Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficient for the scale was calculated as 0.70. In line with the second aim of the study, the data were tested using a structural equation model analysis. Research results showed that depression, anxiety, and stress have a full mediator role in the relationship between social distancing and resilience for Turkish residents. In other words, this study eliminates social distancing’s predictability of resilience by the insertion of the mediatory variable of depression, anxiety, and stress into the structural equation model. © 2021, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19, a major “Public Health Emergencies of International Concern”, had sought greater attention among researchers to study its pathogenesis, associated complications and management. However, there are only few studies that had studied its potential impact on mental health of general public, who are subjected to social distancing, community lockdown and restrictions in their routine activities. Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of psychological distress and mental health needs among general public in Tamil Nadu subjected to lockdown, social distancing amidst COVID-19 crisis. Tamil Nadu is one of the worst affected states of southern India. Methods: A self-administered, web-based application study using “WHO-Self Reported Questionnaire-20”, in bilingual version, both English and Tamil, is used to screen the public for the level of distress. The study is done while the state is under extended lockdown and restricted movement. Key findings: A total of 918 respondents participated in the survey and it is found that about more than one third of the respondents (∼35%) are under psychological distress. A significant association between younger age group, female gender, unmarried, people with children are found to be under distress. The lockdown had increased the frequency of smoking and quantity of cigarettes among smokers, also has increased the frequency of drinking among alcohol consumers. Of the SRQ-20 items recorded, stress related neurotic symptoms (> 70%) was observed more than the depressive mood. About 33% of those scored > 7, had suicidal tendency. The districts declared red zones had significantly reported a greater number of respondents under distress. Conclusion: Besides effectively mitigating the COVID-19 crisis, in terms of prevention, control and treatment strategies, it is prerogative to effectively manage fear, distress due to the COVID-19 and associated anxiety and depression among the public. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - For many social science scholars, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-think our approaches to research. As a result of new social distancing measures, those of us who conduct in-person qualitative and ethnographic research have faced significant challenges in accessing the populations and fields we study. Technology served as an incredibly useful tool for social interaction and research prior to the pandemic, and it has since become even more important as a way to engage with others. Although not all types of social research, or even all projects, lend themselves to online activities, digital communication platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Facebook have allowed many of us to continue our studies from a distance—in some cases, significant temporal and spatial distances away from our research sites. As such, it is important to consider how these different methodological approaches challenge our understandings of fieldwork. While the disadvantages of not physically accessing the places we study are clear, can mediated approaches offer (any) hope of the immersion we experienced with in-person fieldwork? If many of us are able to continue ethnographic research (in some form) without co-locating with our participants in our field sites, how are our studies fundamentally affected, as well as the ways we conceptualize the ‘field’ more largely? This paper explores these methodological and epistemological questions through reflections on conducting online research during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study focuses on social media use of citizens from two groups that are often associated with the rise of social media: populist and postmaterialist citizens. Considering their ideological underpinnings, we theorize that they will make more political use of social media and that this further reifies their political attitudes into voting for populist and postmaterialist parties, respectively. Using unique survey data including the relatively new populist attitudes and political use of social media, we test this theory on the Dutch case. We find that both groups do not read political news or connect to politicians more, but both are more likely to react to political content. Moreover, social media use does not seem to lead to a retention in one’s own ideological funnel signified by populist or postmaterialist voting. Among more postmaterialist citizens, passive social media use even makes it more likely to vote for other parties. © 2021, European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Aims: One of the ways to manage the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is to monitor the public knowledge, risk perceptions, adherence to preventive measures, and level of preparedness behaviors. This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults ≥18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors’ social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance. Results: Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently. Predictors of self-perceived risk of COVID-19 were age 40–59 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.217–3.435), ≥ 60 years (OR 4.68, CI 1.888–11.583), and visiting crowded places (OR 2.27, CI 1.499–3.448). Conclusion: Our study recommends more rigorous public health education aimed at improving COVID-19 outbreak response in Nigeria. In addition, physical and social distancing should be emphasized across all age groups with additional focus on the older population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Since its 2016 launch, negative attitudes toward The Athletic, a network of hyperlocal subscription sports news sites, have resonated throughout the journalism community because of the new media startup’s nontraditional approach, one centered on hiring established journalists from the hometown newspaper. Therefore, to accurately paint a picture of The Athletic’s perceived impact on print journalism, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with newspaper sports editors. This analysis reveals that most sports editors were generally accepting of The Athletic and viewed its presence as reinforcement that newspapers need to stick to daily coverage to stand out in the crowded sports media marketplace. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The failure of large-scale resettlement policies has been largely determined by the collective resistance of residents. For migrants who must leave their original residence and get resettled, mass media and interpersonal communication are important sources to get policy information, which affects their attitudes and responses to resettlement policies. Existing studies have provided two pathways to explain the influencing mechanism between information sources and people’s collective resistance intention. One of these pathways focuses on trust in government and the other highlights perceived benefits. However, it is still unclear how to predict migrants’ collective resistance intention based on different information sources within these two pathways. By concentrating on the policy domain of Chinese resettlement projects, this study aims to develop an integrated, theoretical framework to explore the causal paths between information sources and migrants’ collective resistance intention. Based on a survey of three towns in Ankang, China, we tested the causal mechanism with a structural equation model. The results demonstrate that the pathway that involves trust in government is more explanatory in illustrating the causal mechanism than the pathway of perceived benefits, and interpersonal communication yields stronger effects than mass media in mitigating migrants’ collective resistance intention. The implications for resettlement policy publicity and trust-building in China are discussed. Points for practitioners: Public communication is a critical competency for public managers. Public managers are recommended to flexibly apply various information sources to communicate with migrants in order to eventually mitigate their collective resistance intention by strengthening their trust in government, as well as their perceived benefits. In the early stages of policy publicity, a variety of mass media are needed to inform the migrants of resettlement policies. Then, at the stage of policy implementation, the primary focus becomes interpersonal communication that offers sufficiently detailed information. In this regard, local government managers should carry out more programs that entail face-to-face information sharing to help participants understand the resettlement policy, and encourage them to explain it to their family and friends. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This article investigates voters' preferences for party families in Western European countries' general elections in the 2000s. According to the realignment literature, “traditional” class voting patterns have been replaced by new class-party alignments: upper-middle employee classes joined the electoral bases of left parties, whereas radical right actors introduced in the electoral competition of the most deprived strata of the population, labeled “left behind”. This article aims to answer to the research questions: do social class and political values affect voting behavior in Western European general elections? Which direction are these variables associated with the preference of party families? The first section outlines the theoretical framework, accounting for the “societal modernization” processes, which have been affecting Western societies since the late 1960s. Among the “traditional” cleavages, the literature assumes the realignment of class voting patterns, as well as alignments between value orientations and political preferences. Indeed, class-party alignments are mediated by the political supply's mobilization of voters according to their value orientations. Such appeals differ among party families, partly explaining why specific classes constitute their electoral bases or contested stronghold. The theoretical framework hypothesizes political values as clustered in three ideologies (social and economic conservatism-liberalism, and authoritarianism-libertarianism). Those political values, which do not assimilate in ideologies, constitute more proximal factors, i.e., evaluations of specific political issues close to elections (attitudes). Having defined class voting realignment and a theoretical account of value voting, the paper empirically investigates their associations with vote choices in Western Europe. The analyses ground on European Social Survey data, aggregating the responses concerning the 12 Western European countries for which data are available in all waves. The dependent variable clusters the parties, which competed in the general elections occurred in the time span considered, in party families. Fixed effects multinomial logistic regression models are performed to detect which social classes constitute party families' bases or contested stronghold and how more proximal variables based on values account for class voting patterns. The results clearly show whose social classes are more likely to have voted for radical left, center-left, center-right, and radical right party families. Political ideologies account for a portion of these preferences for mainstream political actors, whereas political attitudes partly explain the introduction of radical right parties in the competition for working classes with left families.

AB  - Many people have preconceived notions about games and distrust the effects of game-based learning and show negative attitudes. In fact, there are limitations and disadvantages of game-based learning, and it is difficult to overcome them. More than half of the inconveniences or problems of teachers who want to try game-based learning revealed by the 2009 survey have not been solved yet. Due to the sudden spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Education has issued a policy to convert classes at schools and academies into non-face-to-face. Non-face-to-face classes have the characteristics that instructors and learners will be spatially separated, spatially simultaneous, interactive, and teaching and learning behavior will be mediated by the screen. And these features are common to live streaming. Taking advantage of this, this study aims to approach improving the perception of game-based learning as an advantage of "watching games" beyond "playing games" by using live streaming for game-based learning. This study conducted game-based learning and game streaming learning for 210 third-year middle school students, compared the effects of game-based learning on learning interest, immersion, and satisfaction with the results of previous studies to verify the design and prove the combined effect of live streaming and game-based learning. In addition, in-depth interviews with instructors who conducted game-based learning confirmed that awareness of the introduction, value, and finance of game-based learning improved. © 2022, Serious Games Society.

AB  - Finding communication strategies that effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This crosscountry, preregistered experiment (n = 25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of social distancing messages that promoted personal agency and reflective choices (i.e., an autonomy-supportive message) or were restrictive and shaming (i.e., a controlling message) compared with no message at all. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses in that the controlling message increased controlled motivation (a poorly internalized form of motivation relying on shame, guilt, and fear of social consequences) relative to no message. On the other hand, the autonomy-supportive message lowered feelings of defiance compared with the controlling message, but the controlling message did not differ from receiving no message at all. Unexpectedly, messages did not influence autonomous motivation (a highly internalized form of motivation relying on one's core values) or behavioral intentions. Results supported hypothesized associations between people's existing autonomous and controlled motivations and self-reported behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing. Controlled motivation was associated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intention to engage in social distancing, whereas autonomous motivation was associated with less defiance and more short- and long-term intentions to social distance. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication, with implications for the current and future global health challenges. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has changed lives in an unprecedented way. The most notable and urgent requirement to combat the epidemic was to transform the way human interacts with each other. The adherence to maintaining social distance has given an upsurge to the increased usage of mobile app users. This change in human interaction for fulling their basic to social to work needs through the intervention of app usage has led to privacy concerns by users. By keeping in view the changing dynamics of the way society works, this study is an endeavor to investigate gender differences of ad intrusive and privacy concerns on app usage behavior. Employing a quantitative research design, 371 respondents were surveyed using through an online structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed by using partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Results suggest that advertising intrusiveness and privacy concerns are significant in determining the consumer’s attitude toward App usage, and a positive attitude toward App usage results in App usage behavior. However, gender’s moderating role in attitude toward app usage and app usage behavior is insignificant for this study. The study provides a more comprehensive understanding and complements prior insights on ads intrusiveness and privacy concerns toward app usage. Copyright © 2022 Bano, Sarfraz, Salameh and Jan.

AB  - Companies often seek to persuade consumers to buy products or services through assertive advertising, but such advertising is often resisted by consumers. In order to identify ways to increase consumers' preference for assertive advertising, this study starts by considering consumers' anxiety and finds, through two between-group experiments, that the emotional state of consumers when viewing advertisements affects their attitudes toward assertive advertisements: anxious consumers have a more positive attitudes toward assertive advertisement, and cognitive fluency plays a mediating role in the relationship between consumer anxiety and consumer attitudes toward assertive advertisement. This study incorporates consumer anxiety into the study of assertive advertising, thus both enriching the theoretical research on assertive advertising and consumer anxiety and providing novel ideas for companies to enhance the effectiveness of their assertive advertising strategies.

AB  - Objective Data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is limited in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Design A community-based concurrent mixed-method study. Setting In a community setting. Participants Adult residents (n=422) of Akaki Kality subcity who were recruited by a two stage sampling technique and 24 adults who were selected purposively were included for the quantitative and qualitative part of the study respectively. Outcome measures Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semistructured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. Results One out five (19.1%, 95% CI 15.3% to 24.6%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.89), having negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.02), and primary information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.37). Study participants have predominantly stated that they did not have enough information about the vaccine, feared it would not be effective or have too many side effects, and reflected their uncertainty towards the quality of the vaccine. Conclusions A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccines and unwilling to accept them. This was due to the misconceptions, negative attitudes and use of social media as their primary source of information. Providing the community with health education and consistent efforts to enhance the prevention measures are important, particularly using different medias including social media. ©

AB  - This article considers electoral inter-group dynamics in Quebec, Canada, by focusing on what White voters expect from political candidates of color. While significant work has been done on the use of political heuristics such as race or gender-based framing by the media, we do not know as much about the way voters interpret and use these stereotypes in a political context. In this article, we consider voters' interpretation of race-based cues using qualitative evidence gathered in six focus groups. First, we explore the content of stereotypes typically associated with politicians of color in the province. Second, this article provides an assessment of some of the ways in which race-based stereotypes are used to understand politics and evaluate politicians of color. We find that race-based stereotypes contribute to defining expectations regarding politicians' behavior. While voters may consciously choose to favor politicians of color, the perception of social distance between a marginalized candidate and them can also lead to negative cross-ethnic attitudes.

AB  - The world has shrunk due to the COVID-19. This virus took many lives of people. Hence the government proposed a lockdown and closed the educational institutions to decrease the death rate. The cases are controlled to some extent, but still the spread of the virus is not yet controlled. Though lockdown has been released and the educational institutions are being slowly opened with some conditions like wearing masks, maintaining social distance in the public areas and avoiding contact with the infected persons. But the people are not maintaining social distance in the colleges and schools, which can cause risk. Hence it is mandatory to build a model which identifies the people who cross the safe limit of distance. This work focuses on determining the social distance in the educational institutions mainly in the colleges. Generally, most of the colleges have Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras fixed on the campus, in order to determine the social distance among the people, the videos are taken from those CCTV cameras. The people are detected from the video clips using the You Only Look Once Version 3 (YOLO V3) algorithm which is trained on the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset. And the safety distance among the people is found using Euclidean distance. The minimum threshold value is fixed to the safe distance suggested by World Health Organization (WHO). Moreover, a warning is sent to the corresponding coordinators through Short Message Service (SMS) when the people are not in the safer social distance. © 2022, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Amid the turbulent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, telepharmacy has shifted the paradigm of patient care by leveraging digital medicine. Government mandated lockdowns and norms of social distancing have further underscored the need for telepharmacy. Many developed and developing countries implemented such initiatives where pharmacists have provided tele-pharmacy services via telecommunications. However, the implementation and utilization of tele-pharmacy services are quite negligible in resource limited settings due to financial and administrative constraints. This study was aimed to ascertain the perception and readiness of pharmacists working in various sectors of a resource limiting country. Methodology: A cross sectional study was carried out in all provinces of Pakistan to explore the perceptions of pharmacists towards telepharmacy implementation through a 35-items study instrument. The collected data was analyzed descriptively and scored accordingly. The chi-square test was used for inferential analysis on pharmacist’s perception regarding implementation of tele-pharmacy with their demographics. Results: Of 380 pharmacists, the mean age is 27.67 ± 3.67 years with a preponderance of male pharmacists (n = 238, 62.6%). The pharmacists (n = 321, 84.5%) perceived that telepharmacy implementation improves patient’s quality of life and decreases patients’ visits (n = 291, 76.6%). Overall, pharmacists (n = 227, 59.7%) had negative perception towards benefits of telepharmacy implementation, but pharmacists had positive perception towards eligibility (n = 258, 67.9%), regulatory issues (n = 271, 71.3%) and telepharmacy during pandemic and beyond (n = 312, 82.1%). In chi-square testing gender (p = 0.03) and age (p = 0.03) had a significant association with perception regarding regulatory issues. Among perception regarding telepharmacy during COVID-19 pandemic and beyond age had a significant association (p = 0.03). Among perception regarding eligibility job location of pharmacists had significant association (p = 0.04). Conclusion: The majority of pharmacists had a positive perception regarding the eligibility of patients and regulatory issues/legal framework regarding the implementation of tele-pharmacy, as well as its use during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The implementation of tele-pharmacy can play a major role in providing timely and better patient care to remote patient areas and may help in the prevention and treatment of different infectious diseases.

AB  - Purpose: Drawing from uncertainty reduction theory and uncertainty management theory, the aim of the research is to investigate the influence of positive change orientation (i.e. change self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward change, perceived control) on the perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support (i.e. compliance, cooperation and championing) relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The paper hypothesizes that employees' positive change orientation partially mediates the relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. The research data were collected from employees and their supervisors in three sequential phases. The research model was tested with the use of Structural Equation Modeling. Findings: The research findings suggest that employees' change self-efficacy and attitudes toward change partially mediates the negative relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. Practical implications: The results support that change management practitioners will benefit significantly if they manage to influence their employees' positive change orientation as well as to decrease the perceived uncertainty to provoke change supportive behaviors. Relevant suggestions are made. Originality/value: The originality of this study lies in the finding that employees' change self-efficacy as well as their attitudes toward change partially mediates the relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. Further, the research findings add to the uncertainty reduction theory and uncertainty management theory as well as other related notions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy is responsible for low vaccine coverage and increased risk of epidemics. The purpose of this study was to assess whether public knowledge, attitudes, practices, and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 have changed over time and at different stages of vaccination. Methods: Two consecutive surveys were conducted among residents of the Leshan Community in Jinan from May to June, 2021 (n = 423) (basic dose vaccination phase) and from December, 2021 to January, 2022 (n = 470) (booster vaccination phase). Randomly sampling was used in residents to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices of the subjects in different survey stages. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore factors related to vaccination hesitancy. Results: In the booster vaccination phase, protective behaviors (89.9%) of residents increased significantly compared with the basic vaccination phase (74.5%). Residents were more hesitant to receive booster doses than basal doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 18.334, 95% CI: 9.021–37.262). Residents with other marital statuses (OR: 2.719, 95% CI: 1.632–4.528), negative attitudes toward government measures were more hesitant to get vaccinated (OR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.612–4.118). People who thought their physical condition was very good or good were more likely to be vaccinated than those who thought they were in fair or poor health (OR: 0.516, 95% CI: 0.288–0.925; OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.295–0.893). Young people inclined to use new media (such as WeChat and microblog) to obtain information, while the elderly inclined to use traditional methods (such as television). Government propaganda, residents' perception of the importance of vaccines and the risk of disease were the main reasons for accelerating residents to vaccinate. The main reasons affecting residents' lack of vaccination were contraindications to the vaccine or inconvenient time for vaccination. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy increased significantly with change in vaccination stage. Strategies should be adopted to increase vaccination coverage such as improving the convenience of vaccination, promoting through multiple channels.

AB  - Business firms and the public have encountered massive consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has become the most significant challenge and influenced all communities. This research study focuses on exploring the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, social distancing, individuals' attitudes toward social media use, and practices of using social media amid the COVID-19 crisis. This study examines how attitudes toward social media use mediate the linkage between COVID-19 knowledge, social distancing, and practices for social media use. This survey uses a non-probability convenience sampling approach to collect samples and recruit willing respondents with their consent for data collection. This study recorded the feedback from 348 participants who encountered the indirect/direct effects of nationwide lockdowns, restrictions on social gatherings, and COVID-19 infection. The findings validate the proposed hypotheses for their direct effects and indicate significant β-values, t-statistics, and the p-values at p <0.001. The results validate a relationship between the COVID-19 knowledge of and social distancing practices. Similarly, the results approved a positive link between social distancing and attitudes toward social media use amid COVID-19. The findings validate the relation between social distancing and attitudes toward social media use during COVID-19 challenges (β-value = 0.22 and t-statistics = 3.078). The results show the linkage between attitudes toward social media use and practices of using social media (β-value = 0.41, and t-statistics = 7.175). Individuals' attitude toward social media use during COVID-19 mediates the connection between COVID-19 knowledge and COVID-19 practices of using social media use. The results validate the first mediation at β-value = 0.21 and t-statistic = 5.327. Similarly, the findings approve that attitudes toward social media use in the pandemic have positively mediated the relation between distancing and practices for social media use amid the crisis of COVID-19 (β-value = 0.09 and t-statistic = 2.633). The findings indicate how people have been indulged in social media to pave their business communication needs. The results provide valuable insights for the global business community. This study provides a systematic and holistic research model that helps in exploring the consequences of COVID-19. The generalizability of the findings provides valuable directions for future research related to the current pandemic. Copyright © 2022 Yu, Abbas, Draghici, Negulescu and Ain.

AB  - Introduction: In Sweden, often seen as one of the most egalitarian countries, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed high levels of health inequality, especially harming people with a refugee background. This is also despite Sweden's image as a refugee-friendly country. In this context, the aim of this paper is to better understand how Swedish health- and social workers have reacted to the health- and social needs of refugees during the pandemic. The Swedish case is particularly interesting because, as seen in the paper, health- and social workers had the task of communicating health guidance to refugees who were sometimes more reliant on information from abroad where the consensus on COVID-19 restrictions ran contrary to the approach recommended by the Swedish public health authority. Method: The study utilizes a qualitative content analysis of 13 in-depth interviews with health- and social workers in Sweden, active in the care of refugees within different kinds of health- and social care settings. Results: The analysis showed that healthcare services have remained open during the pandemic but with new precautions at reception areas impacting how refugees access healthcare. As discussed in the article, the shift to digital tools has particularly impacted refugees, worsening already existing barriers to healthcare services faced by those with refugee status. Public health recommendations were poorly designed to the needs of refugees whose living conditions often prevented them from self-isolation and social distancing. Furthermore, Sweden's initially non-restrictive approach to the pandemic instructed health- and social-workers to encourage refugees to take far fewer precautions (e.g., self-isolation, home-schooling, pregnant women to avoid virus hotspots) compared both with European neighbors and the international media typically used by refugees. When Sweden shifted toward a more restrictive approach, health- and social-workers had to revise their guidance in relation to the new recommendations around precautions. Conclusion: Refugees have faced increased barriers to maintaining their health and wellbeing during the pandemic that exceed those experienced by the rest of the Swedish population. Refugees have, in general, taken precautions in regard to social distancing and followed recommendations but faced challenges with social distancing due to isolation and crowded living. Public health authorities have often failed to acknowledge that individuals use increasingly diverse sources of knowledge when trying to protect their health, and that not everyone has access to the knowledge needed to access healthcare and social systems. At the same time, there is a need to acknowledge that refugees are sometimes a source of expertise that was ignored by the Swedish health and social system during the pandemic. There is a need for urgent efforts to halt the worsening health conditions for this specific group, but also to counter knock-on societal effects and rising health inequity.

AB  - To increase public awareness and disseminate health information, the WHO and health departments worldwide have been visualizing the latest statistics on the spread of COVID-19 to increase awareness and thus reduce its spread. Within various sources, graphs are frequently used to illustrate COVID-19 datasets. Limited research has provided insights into the effect of different graphs on emotional stress and ineffective behavioral strategies from a cross-cultural perspective. The result of current research suggests a graph with a high proportion size of the colored area (e.g., stacked area graph) might increase people's anxiety and social distancing intentions; people in collectivist culture might have a high level of anxiety and social distancing intentions; the effect of different graphs on social distancing intentions is mediated by anxiety experienced. Theoretical contribution and practical implications on health communication were also discussed in this study. Copyright © 2022 Luo, Zhang and Song.

AB  - Purpose: Mixed products, while presenting new business opportunities, raise considerable concerns among managers and researchers. However, whether mixed products (functionally vs culturally) trigger positive or negative consumer reactions is controversial. Hereby, the present research seeks to resolve the conflicting effects by examining the moderating role of service provider type (humanoid service robot vs human employee) in the impact of mixed products on consumer reactions. Design/methodology/approach: Two studies were conducted to explore the effect of mixed products on consumer reactions. Specifically, study 1 was developed to examine the interplay of mixed products and service provider type in shaping consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions under an offline shopping scenario; study 2 further provided evidence for the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above processes under an online-shopping context. Findings: The convergent findings of two studies conclude that, when served by a humanoid service robot (vs human employee), consumers exhibit more positive attitudes and higher purchase intentions toward functionally (vs culturally) mixed products. Furthermore, such effect is driven by the perceived usefulness (vs perceived enjoyment) when served by humanoid robot (vs human employee). Originality/value: First, this is one of the first studies to conceptualize mixed products as the two-dimensional construct (i.e. functionally mixed and culturally mixed), and the findings sheds light on the mixed products literature. Second, this paper introduces service provider type as the boundary condition for the impact of mixed products on consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions, which expands the match-up hypothesis and schema theory in service marketing. Third, the current research explores the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above effects, which could make significant contribution to the motivation theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Airborne transmittable diseases such as COVID-19 spread from an infected to healthy person when they are in proximity to each other. Epidemiologists suggest that the risk of COVID-19 transmission increases when an infected person is within 6 feet from a healthy person and contact between them lasts longer than 15 minutes (also called Too Close For Too Long (TC4TL). In this paper, we systematically investigate Machine Learning (ML) methods to detect proximity by analyzing publicly available dataset gathered from smartphones' built-in Bluetooth, accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors. We extract 20 statistical features from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors signals and 28 statistical features of Bluetooth signal, which are classified to determine whether subjects are closer than 6 feet as well as the subjects' context. Using machine learning regression, we also estimate the range between the subjects. Among the 19 ML classification and regression methods that we explored, we found that ensemble (boosted and bagged trees) methods perform best with accelerometer and gyroscope data while regression trees ML algorithm performs best with the Bluetooth signal. We further explore sensor fusion methods and demonstrate that the combination of all three sensors achieves a higher accuracy of range estimation than when using each individual sensor. We show that proximity (< 6ft or not) can be classified with 72%-90% accuracy using the accelerometer, 78%-84% accuracy using gyroscope sensor, and with 76%-92% accuracy with the Bluetooth data. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods using neural networks and achieved a Normalized Decision Cost Function (nDCF) score of 0.34 with Bluetooth radio and 0.36 with sensor fusion. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Objective. To investigate the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research from the perspective of postgraduate students. Methods. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted from October 31 to November 1, 2021. A questionnaire was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 social distancing on medical research among postgraduate students. The questionnaire included basic information, medical research information, and information about social distancing measures. Participants also completed the self-made Research Work Affected Scale of Postgraduates (RWAS-P; qualitative evaluation: very mildly 0- 10; mildly 11-20; moderately 21-30; severely 31-40; very severely 41-50). Logistic regression was used to identify factors related to the impact of COVID-19 social distancing. Results. A total of 468 participants were analyzed; 95.2% of the participants adhered to social distancing measures. The median total RWAS-P score was 22. The median RWAS-P scores for earlier research data, current research projects, future research plans, paper publication, and graduation schedule were 2, 6, 6, 6, and 4, respectively (score range 0-10). The higher grade of students, experimental research, and existence of inappetence or sleeplessness were related to negative attitude towards COVID-19 social distancing (odd ratio D 6.35, 9.80, 2.31, 2.15, 1.95, respectively). Conclusions. Participants reported that social distancing had a moderate overall impact on their medical research. Social distancing had the greatest impact on current research projects, future research plans, and paper publications among postgraduate students. Higher grade level, experimental research type, inappetence, and sleeplessness were related to the impact of social distancing on their medical research. © 2022 Dong et al.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to argue for the values of familial caring and relationships in addition to the provision of social media technology during the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach: The discussion of this paper has adopted an inter-disciplinary approach by integrating health care system and psychological analysis, based on cultural philosophical argument through the hermeneutic approach of classical texts and critical analysis. Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the dilemma between the public health measures for COVID-19 and sustaining elderly social psychological health through familial connection. From a Confucian perspective, the practice of filial piety (xiao, 孝), which demands taking care of parents, is essential for one’s moral formation, and for one’s becoming a virtuous (ren, 仁) person. The necessity of taking care of elderly parents by adult children is not something that can be explained in terms of consequentialism. Indeed, the rising trend of instrumental rationality seems to weaken rather than strengthen the sense of filial obligation. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic which tends to separate connections between family members, the author argues that we should emphasize the values of familial caring and relationship because it enhances the elderly’s characteristic of resilience. Originality/value: This paper shows that while social media technology has mitigated the negative effect of social distancing, such online relationships should never replace the bodily connections between the elderly and their family members from a Confucian perspective. © 2022, Andrew T.W.

AB  - Purpose: Entrepreneurship, which traditionally has been a male occupation, still attracts fewer women than men. Challenging gender stereotypes within entrepreneurship is one avenue to increase women's entrepreneurial intention and promote women entrepreneurship. This study adapts the “think manager – think male” leadership perspective to the entrepreneurship context and explores gender stereotype's implications for both entrepreneurial intention and motivation to become an entrepreneur. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 902 Spanish non-entrepreneurs, both male and female, were randomly asked about the representation of successful entrepreneurs (no-gender-mention), successful men entrepreneurs or successful women entrepreneurs (reduced stereotype threat condition vs no-gender-mention or men entrepreneurs' conditions). Then, female participants' entrepreneurial intention, its antecedents (i.e. attitudes toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms and entrepreneurial self-efficacy) and necessity vs opportunity motivation were measured and compared to their male counterparts' scores in those three conditions. Findings: Female participants reported higher entrepreneurial intention, self-efficacy and opportunity motivation when assigned to the successful women entrepreneurs' condition. Younger participants – compared to older ones – also exhibited higher entrepreneurial intention and opportunity motivation, more positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship and higher scores in subjective norms. Furthermore, findings suggest a woman entrepreneur seems to be less accessible (or more counter-stereotypical) to male participants than to female participants and, thus, the “think entrepreneur – think male” bias is more noticeable in male participants. Therefore, reducing negative stereotype threat for women in entrepreneurship may increase women's entrepreneurial career aspirations. This is of utmost importance to optimize training courses and mentoring programs to strengthen women's self-efficacy in their entrepreneurial skills and capabilities. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature about gender, entrepreneurial intention and motivation by adapting a leadership paradigm (“think manager – think male”) to entrepreneurship (“think entrepreneur – think male”). These findings shed new light on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention and motivation and have implications for policy measures. Acknowledging that exposure to successful women entrepreneurs as role models potentially facilitates entrepreneurship among women, governments should provide tailor-made incentives and support for women entrepreneurs in the form of awareness raising, networking and in the mass media. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the attitude of medical students towards cultural diversity aiming to elucidate our current status in understanding cultural awareness and sensitivity. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A web-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 601 undergraduate health science students (medical and dental courses) at a health sciences university in eastern Nepal via various modes of social-media platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, etc. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical students' attitude towards cultural diversity and its association with the sociodemographic profile of the students. RESULTS: A total of 601 students participated in the study, out of which, 64.2% were men with a sex ratio of 1.8:1 and a mean age of 22.3±1.9 years. More than two-thirds (77.2%) of the students had an excellent to good attitude towards cultural diversity. The proportion of students reporting 'excellent' attitude towards cultural diversity was higher among male students compared with female students (37.8% vs 20.5%) and students aged >22 years compared with younger students (37.1% vs 26.7%). Gender (p<0.001) and age (p=0.009) were significantly associated with the attitude towards cultural diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students, in general, are aware of the impacts of a cross-cultural society on the delivery of quality healthcare and also about the need to be aware of prejudices doctors may have towards certain cultures. Majority suggest the inclusion of concepts of multicultural awareness and sensitivity in the medical curriculum itself. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this rapid scoping review was to map existing literature on risk communication strategies implemented by authorities and aimed at vulnerable immigrants in the context of pandemics. Design/methodology/approach: Existing literature on the topic was charted in terms of its nature and volume by summarizing evidence regarding the communication strategies. Literature searches were conducted in Academic Search Premier and CINAHL, databases were searched from 2011 to present on March 31, 2021. Findings: Five articles met the criteria and were included in this review, pointing at limited research in this area. The findings indicated that a close interaction between communication authorities and immigrants is important. Community education, building trust in communication sources, clear risk communication and inclusive decision-making among all were found to be important when communicating health risks to immigrants. Research limitations/implications: The primary limitation of this rapid scoping review is that the literature searches were conducted in only two databases, namely, Academic Search Premier and CINAHL. A wider search across several other databases could have given more profound results. Furthermore, some studies where immigrants were conceptualized as, for instance, “disadvantaged groups” might be overseen due to a choice of the search strategy used in this study. There are also certain limitations related to the studies included in this review. Practical implications: Identifying efficient ways of conveying recommendations may further assist authorities and scientists in developing more effective health-related risk communication. Originality/value: This study covered health-related risk communication in the context of pandemics, addressing the need to investigate different groups of immigrants and the challenges related to communicating risks to these groups. © 2021, Olena Koval, Ole Andreas Engen, Jacob Kringen and Siri Wiig.

AB  - Purpose: The spread of fake news on social networking sites (SNS) poses a threat to the marketing landscape, yet little is known about how fake news affect consumers’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach: Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings: Factors affecting consumers’ perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers’ brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers’ blame, which is determined by consumers’ perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers’ motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study’s novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications: This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news. Originality/value: By simultaneously considering consumers’ perceptions of the source, information and medium (i.e. SNS), this study presents a novel conceptual framework providing a marketing-centered, dynamic view on consumers’ fake news experience and connecting consumers’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the context of fake news. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Online learning environments are becoming more frequent in teaching and learning than ever before. Asynchronous learning provides 'high degree of interactivity' between participants and helps them to reflect upon their ideas/thoughts, before sharing them with others leading to more insightful responses and in-depth learning. Moderating an online discussion is an art and challenging task, which needs meticulous planning and effective execution approaches. One of the major challenges in online discussion is to ensure active participation and interest among participants, and therefore, it reiterates the need for inclusion of interactive strategies to enable it meaningful and effective. The present article is to share our experiences in moderating session on 'Dramatics in Medical Education' (DIME) as a part of ML web discussion of Foundation for Advancement in International Medical Education and Research (FAIMER) at one of the regional FAIMER institutes in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two FAIMER fellows participated in online discussion on DIME, supplemented with various engagement triggers including, sharing of real-life situation case scenarios, motivational quotes, competitions and rewards, script writing, script editing exercises by using Forum Theatre method, discussion on uploaded academic videos on 'YouTube,' use of mnemonics, etc. RESULTS: Online discussion yielded improved knowledge and positive attitudes of participants toward DIME. Task-based exercises within authentic or realistic situations, teamwork, and interactions facilitated active learning of participants. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate planning, well coordination, and interactive strategies can foster learning and reflective abilities as well as develop favorable perceptions of learners toward virtual mode of teaching-learning. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

AB  - Background: Digital 3D total-body photography of the skin surface is an emerging imaging modality that can facilitate the identification of new and changing nevi. Objective: We aimed to describe the experiences of study participants drawn from the general population who were provided 3D total-body photography and dermoscopy for the monitoring of nevi. Methods: A population-based prospective study of adults aged 20-70 years from South East Queensland, Australia was conducted. Participants underwent 3D total-body photography and dermoscopy every 6 months over a 3-year period. Participants were asked to provide closed and open-ended feedback on their 3D total-body photography and dermoscopy experience (eg, comfort, trust, intended future use, and willingness to pay) at the halfway study time point (18 months) and final study time point (36 months). We assessed changes in participants’ reported experience of 3D total-body photography, and patient characteristics associated with patient experience at the end of the study (36 months) were analyzed. Results: A total of 149 participants completed the surveys at both the 18- and 36-month time points (median age 55, range 23-70 years; n=94, 63.1% were male). At the 18-month time point, most participants (n=103, 69.1%) stated they completely trusted 3D total-body imaging for the diagnosis and monitoring of their nevi, and this did not change at the 36-month (n=104, 69.8%) time point. The majority of participants reported that they were very comfortable or comfortable with the technology at both the 18- (n=138, 92.6%) and 36-month (n=140, 94%) time points, respectively; albeit, the number of participants reporting that they were very comfortable reduced significantly between the 18- and 36-month time points, from 71.1% (n=106) to 61.1% (n=91; P=.01). Almost all participants (n=140, 94%) would consider using this technology if it were to become commercially available, and this did not change during the two study time points. Half of the participants (n=74) cited barriers to participating in 3D total-body photography, including trust in the ability of this technology to detect and monitor suspicious lesions, digital privacy, cost, and travel requirements. Conclusions: The majority of participants expressed positive attitudes toward 3D total-body photography for the monitoring of their moles. Half of the participants identified potential barriers to uptake. ©Caitlin Horsham, Montana O'Hara, Saira Sanjida, Samantha Ma, Dilki Jayasinghe, Adele C Green, Helmut Schaider, Joanne F Aitken, Richard A Sturm, Tarl Prow, H Peter Soyer, Monika Janda.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the adoption of lockdowns, social distancing, and quarantines as measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus, forcing education spaces in both developed and developing economies to suddenly shift towards adoption of emergency online teaching and learning. However, developing economies were lagging in the migration to online teaching and learning strategies due to incapacity and lack of resources such as formal learning management systems (LMS) that support the migration. Social media use has been identified as an alternative given the sharp rise in social media (SM) presence and activities around the world by individuals of different age, regardless of economic status, during the lockdowns. A few studies have been conducted on the perceptions of SM use by preservice teachers in a developing country context. Through the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study applied a mixed methods approach to examine perceptions of preservice teachers on SM use in teaching during the practice periods. Results revealed that preservice teachers perceived SM platforms as mainly for social purposes rather than educational purposes, despite their high usage of WhatsApp and YouTube. The study recommends initiatives to change preservice teachers' mindset as part of teachers' professional development to get them to appreciate the usefulness of SM platforms in education contexts. © Author.

AB  - In this study, I take a critical look at the presence of narcoculture in reggaeton using as a case study the music video of the remix of 'Somos de calle'. Specifically, I evaluate whether and to what extent reggaeton's narco-messages and narco-representations - when they converge with other variables - could potentially influence an individual's modes of thinking and behaviour. The study does not aim to provide a definitive answer to the debate surrounding this issue. More than anything, it strives to analyse the extent to which the claim that such influence may occur has scientific merit, in order to advocate further research on this matter. The article also discusses the highly politicized debate that has surrounded this topic in public discourse, and how this has seemingly affected its critical assessment in academia. For the analysis I rely particularly on social psychology literature concerning violent media content and in the areas of persuasion studies and prejudice studies, but I also consider literature from other fields, including criminology. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Past research has examined the beneficial effects of contact focusing mainly on the affective dimension of intergroup relationships. Limited research has examined cognitive dimensions, in particular considering at the same time minority and majority group perspectives. This study tested whether contact in a work context relates differentially to the perception of interethnic conflict in Italian (n = 67) and immigrant (n = 40, all male) blue-collar coworkers with the potential mediation of reciprocal stereotypical content (competence and warmth dimensions), interethnic attitudes, perceived discrimination, and whether organizational identification amplifies the effect of contact. Multigroup path analysis revealed that the two stereotype dimensions, warmth and competence, mediate the relationship between interethnic contact and perceived discrimination for Italians, and between organizational identification and perceived conflict for immigrants. Results highlighted an asymmetrical effect of contact on perceived conflict, detrimental and direct for immigrant workers, beneficial and mediate via the outgroup cognitive image for the Italian workers. Findings suggest that a superordinate identity, in terms of organizational identification, may be effective in reducing conflict at the workplace for majority members, whilst a personalized strategy seems to be more suitable for minority members. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with the acculturation perspective. © 2022, PsychOpen. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effect of any kind of genetic disorder is almost irreversible in life, so it is very important to understand these disorders and the modern, effective preventive approaches available to reduce the familial and societal burden. This study aims to measure the awareness of Genetic Counselling (GC) and investigate personal factors like knowledge, attitude, and willingness towards the purpose of genetic counselling among the South Indian population. Individuals from the state of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala, and Pondicherry participated in the study. Knowledge score was generated for everyone, ranging from 19 to 42, with which varied results were generated compared to other variables. Four hundred and sixty-seven individuals completed the survey. About fifty-nine percent of the respondents reported familiarity with GC and the main source of knowledge was through media. Positive attitude and willingness towards GC were reported in the population. Knowledge of GC showed a different trend when compared to other studies of similar objectives. The need for more qualified professionals in the field and the inclusion of genetic counselling and testing as a primary preventive measure in government health care sectors will help reduce the burden of genetic diseases in families and society. © 2022, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

AB  - The development and scope of using various food preservation methods depends on the level of consumers’ acceptance. Despite their advantages, in the case of negative attitudes, producers may limit their use if it determines the level of sales. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of seven different food processing methods and to identify influencing factors, such as education as well as living area and, at the same time, to consider whether consumers verify this type of information on the labels. Additionally, the study included the possibility of influencing consumer attitudes by using alternative names for preservation methods, on the example of microwave treatment. The results showed that conventional heat treatments were the most preferred preservation methods, whereas preservatives, irradiation, radio waves and microwaves were the least favored, suggesting that consumers dislike methods connected with “waves” to a similar extent as their dislike for preservatives. The control factors proved to significantly modify the evaluation of the methods. The analysis of alternative names for microwave treatment showed that “dielectric heating” was significantly better perceived. These research findings are important as the basis for understanding consumer attitudes. Implications for business and directions of future research are also indicated. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak caused huge losses for the catering industry. The outbreak’s influence on consumers’ risk perception and risk attitude was an important factor for these heavy losses. The aim of this study was to investigate the change in epidemic risk perception, risk attitude, and the consumers’ willingness to consume products from restaurants during the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The study collected 502 questionnaires at the end of 2021, and structural analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 20.0 statistical programs. The results showed that consumers’ awareness of the coronavirus pandemic (consumers’ epidemic risk perception) had a significant positive effect on their decision-making behavior under uncertain conditions (risk attitude); consumers’ decision-making behavior under uncertain conditions (risk attitude) had a significant negative effect on their willingness to purchase from restaurants; consumers’ awareness of the coronavirus pandemic (consumers’ epidemic risk perception) had a significant negative effect on their willingness to consume products from restaurants; and risk attitude played a mediating role in the influence of consumers’ epidemic risk perception on their willingness to consume products from restaurants. This study can provide guidance and reference for restaurants on how to deal with the epidemic situation, help them undertake risk prevention work and reduce losses, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the restaurant. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19–related keywords and then using vaccine- and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule–based and deep learning–based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes. ©Zain Hussain, Zakariya Sheikh, Ahsen Tahir, Kia Dashtipour, Mandar Gogate, Aziz Sheikh, Amir Hussain.

AB  - The lockdown imposed in Italy due to the COVID-19 outbreak required restrictions that severely limited individual freedom to protect the population and reduce virus diffusion. This situation psychologically challenged the entire Italian population but mostly the elderly. The “Digital mental health approach” employs digital tools to evaluate and prevent increasing mental health problems. “Anonymous online electronic surveys” are digital tools that assess rates of mental health outcomes (using for example self-assessment/awareness tools). Immediately at the beginning of restrictions, we designed an electronic survey a) to remotely investigate the psychological impact of the lockdown and b) to compare the anxiety between pet owners and not-pet owners. A total of 3905 subjects filled out the survey; we focused our study on 781 (20%) elderly subjects. Dividing elderly patients between pet-owners (n = 405) and not-pet owners (n = 376), the pet owners showed a Zung scale score significantly lower in respect to the not-pet owners. We observed that, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the pet presence could have a positive effect on anxiety in the elderly subject. These results: (A) encourage the use of mobile technologies for the assessment of psychological disorders that can be promptly employed in emergencies such as the COVID-19 outbreak; (B) highlight the positive effect of pet interaction to mitigate the psychological distress in elderly people. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background. The high prevalence of HPV infection among Kazakhstani women and the absence of an HPV vaccination program are directly reflected in increasing rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Kazakhstan made its first attempt at introducing the HPV vaccine in 2013, but was unsuccessful due to complications and low public acceptance. The attitudes of Kazakhstani women towards the vaccine were never measured. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attitudes of women towards the HPV vaccine and determine factors associated with positive, negative, or neutral attitudes. Methods. A 29-item survey consisting of 21 demographic and contextual questions and 8 Likert-scale questions was distributed among women attending gynecological offices in four major cities of Kazakhstan from December 2021 until February 2022. Attitudes of women were measured based on their answers to the eight Likert-scale questions. Ordinal logistic regression was built to find associations between demographic characteristics and attitudes of women. Results. Two hundred thirty-three women were included in the final analysis. A total of 54% of women had positive attitudes towards the vaccine. The majority of women did not trust or had a neutral attitude towards the government, pharmaceutical industry, and traditional and alternative media. However, the trust of women was high in medical workers and scientific researchers. Women’s age, education, number of children, effect of the 2013 HPV program, and trust in alternative medicine were included in the ordinal logistic model. Women with a low level of education, a high number of children, who believe in alternative medicine, and who were affected by the failed 2013 vaccination program were less likely to have a positive attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusions. Contrary attitudes towards HPV vaccination exist among Kazakhstani women, with approximately half having positive and almost half having negative or neutral attitudes towards the vaccine. An informational campaign that takes into consideration women’s levels of trust in different agencies, as well as targets those who are the most uninformed, might help in a successful relaunch of the HPV vaccination program. However, more studies that cover a higher number of women are required. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Due to its rich marine biological resources, Taiwan is a place worthy of developing marine ecotourism. This study explores the marine ecotourism intentions and marine ecotourism behaviors of tourists during the COVID-19 pandemic by using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) method. Under the UTAUT framework, this study considered the factor of environmental attitudes and issued questionnaires in four research areas, namely, Yilan Wushi Fishing Harbor, Port of Hualien, Hualien Stone Stairs Platform, and Taitung Chengfong Fishing Port. In total, 431 effective research samples were collected. First, this study verified the validity and reliability of the dimensions through confirmatory factor analysis. According to the results of structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and environmental attitude all have an influence on tourists’ marine ecotourism intentions, while facilitating conditions had no influences on tourists’ marine ecotourism intentions. Tourists’ marine ecotourism intentions further influenced their marine ecotourism behaviors. In addition, this study evaluated the mediating effect of marine ecotourism intentions by nested-model analysis. Finally, this study provided substantive policy recommendations as a reference for tourism management units and local governments. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Vaccination saves lives and can be an effective strategy for preventing the spread of the COVID-19, but negative attitudes towards vaccines lead to vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to explore the factors influencing the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Nepali community in the United Kingdom (UK). This qualitative study included in-depth interviews with 20 people from Nepal living in the UK. Interviews were conducted by a native-Nepali speaker and all interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English before being analysed thematically. Our study found that attitudes towards COVID-19 are generally positive. Nine overlapping themes around barriers to COVID-19 vaccination were identified: (a) rumours and mis/disinformation; (b) prefer home remedies and yoga; (c) religion restriction; (d) concern towards vaccine eligibility; (e) difficulty with online vaccine booking system; (f) doubts of vaccine effectiveness after changing the second dose timeline; (g) lack of confidence in the vaccine; (h) past bad experience with the influenza vaccine; and i) worried about side-effects. Understanding barriers to the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine can help in the design of better targeted interventions. Public health messages including favourable policy should be tailored to address those barriers and make this vaccination pro-gramme more viable and acceptable to the ethnic minority communities in the UK. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: When the first COVID-19 cases were noticed in China, many racist comments against Chinese individuals spread. As there is a huge need to better comprehend why all of these targeted comments and opinions developed specifically at the start of the outbreak, we sought to carefully examine racism and advocacy efforts on Twitter in the first quarter of 2020 (January 15 to March 3, 2020). Objective: The first research question aimed to understand the main type of racism displayed on Twitter during the first quarter of 2020. The second research question focused on evaluating Twitter users’ positive and negative responses regarding racism toward Chinese individuals. Methods: Content analysis of tweets was utilized to address the two research questions. Using the NCapture browser link and NVivo software, tweets in English and Spanish were pulled from the Twitter data stream from January 15 to March 3, 2020. A total of 19,150 tweets were captured using the advanced Twitter search engine with the keywords and hashtags #nosoyunvirus, #imNotAVirus, #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan, #racism, “No soy un virus,” and “Racismo Coronavirus.” After cleaning the data, a total of 402 tweets were codified and analyzed. Results: The data confirmed clear sentiments of racism against Chinese individuals during the first quarter of 2020. The tweets displayed individual, cultural, and institutional racism. Individual racism was the most commonly reported form of racism, specifically displaying physical and verbal aggression. As a form of resistance, Twitter users created spaces for advocacy and activism. The hashtag “I am not a virus” helped to break stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination on Twitter. Conclusions: Advocacy efforts were enormous both inside and outside the Chinese community; an allyship sentiment was fostered by some white users, and an identification with the oppression experienced by the Chinese population was expressed in the Black and Muslim worldwide communities. Activism through social media manifested through art, food sharing, and community support. ©Amanda Lloret-Pineda, Yuelu He, Josep Maria Haro, Paula Cristóbal-Narváez.

AB  - Background: This study explored the extent of COVID-19 vaccination coverage and investigated drivers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people in prison. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2021 among 517 detained people in the Campania region of South Italy. Results: In total, 47.1% of participants expressed a high concern about contracting COVID-19 after vaccination, whereas 60.6% and 53.8% of respondents reported a positive attitude towards usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Adherence to the active offer of COVID-19 vaccination involved 89.7% of detained subjects. COVID-19 vaccination uptake was significantly higher in females, and in those who reported influenza vaccination uptake, had received information about COVID-19 vaccination from media and newspapers, did not express need of additional information about COVID-19 vaccine, believed that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, were involved in working activities in the prison, and had a high school or university degree. Conclusions: These findings showed a high self-reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage in detained subjects, supporting the effectiveness of the strategy aimed at giving priority to COVID-19 vaccinations in prisons. Further efforts are needed to contrast the hesitancy of those who refused vaccination to increase their confidence about usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This research examines the impact of green marketing and its factors on purchase intention through green brand trust and image. It examines the correlation between six concepts: green knowledge, environmental attitude and knowledge, green image, green trust, and purchase intention. An empirical survey was used to test the hypotheses. Data were collected from a total of 300 respondents from Pakistan, and structural equation modeling (SPSS-AMOS) is proposed to assess the relationships of the research model. The findings show a significant positive association between practical green marketing approaches (green knowledge, attitude, environmental knowledge, and purchase intention for green products); additionally, green products with high ecological qualities create a positive intention towards consumer choice. Furthermore, green marketing approaches (green knowledge, attitude, and environmental knowledge) directly and significantly influence green image and trust. This study suggests that green approaches can be used as a brand marketing strategy to enhance customer purchase intention. The study also found that green marketing can help brands achieve and maintain brand equity. This research explores the relationship between the multidimensional green marketing approaches (green knowledge, attitude, and environmental knowledge) to enhance the purchase intention of green products; the creation of an overpowering market brand was one of its primary objectives. This study offers managerial implications for the development of green firms. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Research registries are a powerful tool for boosting recruitment into clinical trials. However, little is known about how parents approach the decision to enroll their child in a pediatric participant research registry (PPRR). We conducted in-person, written, or telephone surveys with parents/guardians of children hospitalized at Children's Hospital of Omaha, Nebraska to identify attitudes towards and barriers to enrollment in PPRRs. Overall, our population (N = 36) had positive attitudes toward PPRRs, with 77.8% (CI: 61.6, 88.4) of participants stating they were "somewhat"or "very"likely to enroll their child. Likelihood to enroll differed between various recruitment and enrollment methods, with participants stating they would be more likely to enroll their child in a PPRR if they were recruited by their child's primary care provider or a nurse in clinic (p = 0.02) and less likely to enroll if they were recruited through social media (p<0.001). Additionally, over 90% of participants who were likely to enroll their child in a PPRR (N = 28) were also willing to provide demographic, medical, and lifestyle information. However, these participants remained concerned about inappropriate sharing of their information with insurance or for-profit companies (53.6%, CI: 35.8, 70.4) and about receiving unwanted telephone calls from the registry (78.6%, CI: 60.0, 90.0). Parents are generally willing to enroll their child in a PPRR. However, to optimize enrollment, investigators must understand parental preferences for and concerns surrounding enrollment in a PPRR. © 2022 Slotkowski et al.

AB  - During the pandemic, government policies such as social distancing and telework have impacted trust and working or social exchange relationships in the workplace. The behavior of leaders is critical for good leadership, employees’ trust, and social exchange relationships. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the associations among authentic leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships under the influence of leader behavior. A regression-based approach was used to test the moderating and mediating effects. The results show that authentic leadership positively impacts trust and social exchange relationships, whereas trust directly affects social exchange relationships. During COVID-19, leader behaviors with ability, ethics, and positive relationships have had a positive impact on the association between authentic leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships. Additionally, trust positively mediates authentic leadership and social exchange relationships. The findings of this paper suggest that authentic leadership promotes trust and high-quality social exchange relationships. Moreover, based on leader behaviors during COVID-19, the ability to manage change effectively, boost employees’ work motivation, provide support, and take appropriate action is essential for authentic leadership to increase trust and foster a positive working relationship based on social exchange. Finally, regarding social exchange theory, high-quality leader behaviors and the leader–follower relationships drive positive associations among variables. These results will help organizational management teams to find methods to improve their organizational working relationships. The implication is that the abilities, ethics, and supportive and positive relationship behaviors of leaders are essential for effective management to improve leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships. Leaders should have the ability to manage work and people, even with teleworkers. Therefore, leader behaviors are important to maintain organizational sustainability. Further discussion on theoretical and practical implications is provided in the section. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Due to close contact with death, medical students may question their own and their patients’ dying process, especially with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the increase in deaths. This situation provokes fear and negative attitudes towards dealing with patients and their environment. This study aimed to assess the level of fear of death and associated factors in medical students at a Peruvian university. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted during March 2021 in human medicine students from the first to the seventh year. A validated survey including the Collet–Lester fear-of-death scale was applied. Factors associated with the fear-of-death score were evaluated by calculating linear regression coefficients (β). A total of 284 students were included. The median age was 22 years, and 58.1% were female. The mean Collet–Lester scale score was 2.79, and it was higher in the dimensions related to the death of others. Adjusted analysis showed that the score on this scale was lower in students aged 24–40 years compared to 17–21 years (β: −0.25; 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.04) and those who had no religious beliefs (β: −0.29; 95% CI: −0.53 to −0.04). In conclusion, fear of death was lower than reported in other investigations despite the COVID-19 situation, being much lower among older students and those without religious beliefs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Gender and racial diversity in STEM has been deemed an essential need for a sustainable future, but girls and children from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds continue to show less interest in STEM than their White and male counterparts. Media has been shown to reflect children’s occupational schema from an early age, and therefore might be used to help broaden children’s beliefs about who participates in STEM. In this field-based pre/post-experimental study, children in kindergarten and first grades (N = 48, 62.5% female, Mage = 6.57) viewed episodes of a STEM-focused educational television series that features a diverse group of protagonists two to three times a week for eight weeks. Their occupational schema were measured before and after exposure. Results suggest there was no quantifiable change in their attitudes. However, qualitative analysis of their open-ended responses sheds light on how children’s beliefs about who participates in STEM are shaped, i.e., by both mediated and real-world exposure. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objectif: Proposer des stratégies pour améliorer les soins aux femmes en périménopause ou ménopausées d'après les plus récentes données probantes publiées. Population cible: Femmes en périménopause ou ménopausées. Bénéfices, risques et coûts: La population cible bénéficiera des plus récentes données scientifiques publiées que leur communiqueront les fournisseurs de soins de santé. Aucun coût ni préjudice ne sont associés à cette information, car les femmes seront libres de choisir parmi les différentes options thérapeutiques offertes pour la prise en charge des symptômes et morbidités associés à la ménopause, y compris l'abstention thérapeutique. Données probantes: Les auteurs ont interrogé les bases de données PubMed, Medline et Cochrane Library pour extraire des articles publiés entre 2002 et 2020 en utilisant des termes MeSH spécifiques à chacun des sujets abordés dans les 7 chapitres. Méthodes de validation: Les auteurs ont évalué la qualité des données probantes et la force des recommandations en utilisant le cadre méthodologique GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Voir l'annexe A en ligne (tableau A1 pour les définitions et tableau A2 pour l'interprétation des recommandations fortes et faibles). Professionnels concernés: Médecins, y compris gynécologues, obstétriciens, médecins de famille, internistes, urgentologues; infirmières, y compris infirmières autorisées et infirmières praticiennes; pharmaciens; stagiaires, y compris étudiants en médecine, résidents, moniteurs cliniques; et autres fournisseurs de soins auprès de la population cible. DÉCLARATIONS SOMMAIRES: 1. Les causes secondaires de perte de densité osseuse doivent être écartées avant de confirmer la présence d'ostéoporose postménopausique (moyenne). 2. L'outil FRAX peut être utilisé pour évaluer le risque de fracture sur 10 ans (élevée). Il est également possible d'utiliser l'outil d’évaluation CAROC de l'Association canadienne des radiologistes et d'Ostéoporose Canada pour évaluer le risque de fracture sur 10 ans (moyenne). 3. Il y a lieu de s'assurer que les patientes atteintes d'ostéoporose postménopausique ont une alimentation riche en calcium (1 200 mg de calcium élémentaire par jour) et une supplémentation suffisante en vitamine D, en ciblant une concentration de 25-hydroxyvitamine D de 75-125 nmol/L (30-50 ng/ml) (élevée). 4. La pharmacothérapie est recommandée chez les patientes atteintes d'ostéoporose ayant un risque intermédiaire de fracture, c'est-à-dire un risque de fracture ostéoporotique majeure de 10 à 20 % dans les 10 ans (élevée). 5. La pharmacothérapie est recommandée chez les patientes à risque élevé de fracture (risque de fracture ostéoporotique majeure de ≥ 20 % ou risque de fracture de la hanche de ≥ 3 % dans les 10 ans) (élevée). 6. Il est recommandé de traiter toutes les patientes à risque très élevé de fracture (fracture récente au cours des 12 derniers mois, ou plusieurs fractures de fragilité, ou risque de fracture ostéoporotique majeure de &gt; 30 %, ou risque de fracture de la hanche de &gt; 4.5 %), idéalement par un agent anabolisant suivi d'un inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse (modérée). 7. Après 5 ans de traitement par bisphosphonates, on doit envisager une pause thérapeutique chez les patientes ayant un risque intermédiaire de fracture si elles ont un score T supérieur à -2,5 au col du fémur et n'ont aucun antécédent de fracture de fragilité (modérée). 8. Les fractures fémorales atypiques constituent un effet indésirable rare du traitement à long terme par bisphosphonates. Il est important de vérifier la présence de douleur à la cuisse ou à l'aine chez les patientes sous traitement inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse et d'arrêter le traitement si une fracture fémorale atypique est détectée (moyenne). 9. L'ostéonécrose de la mâchoire est une complication rare du traitement inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse; le risque absolu observé chez les personnes sous ce traitement est de 1 cas pour 10 000 à 100 000 patients-années (élevée). 10. On ne doit pas arrêter un traitement au romosozumab, à la tériparatide ou au dénosumab sans le remplacer par un agent inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse pour prévenir la diminution de la densité minérale osseuse et de la résistance osseuse après l'arrêt du traitement (élevée). RECOMMANDATIONS: 1. Il y a lieu de dépister l'augmentation du risque de fracture par évaluation clinique et analyse de la densité minérale osseuse chez toutes les adultes de ≥ 65 ans. Le dépistage communautaire chez les femmes âgées peut s'avérer efficace pour diminuer le nombre de fractures de la hanche (conditionnelle, moyenne). 2. Chez les femmes ménopausées de &lt; 65 ans, il est recommandé d’évaluer le risque de fracture par évaluation clinique sans test de densité minérale osseuse (FRAX sans densité minérale osseuse). L’évaluation de la densité minérale osseuse doit être envisagée chez les patientes ayant une augmentation du risque de fracture due à une maladie ou à la médication et chez celles ayant déjà subi une fracture de fragilité (conditionnelle, faible). Si le score FRAX pour le risque de fracture ostéoporotique majeure sans densité minérale osseuse dépasse les 10 %, il est indiqué d’évaluer aussi la densité minérale osseuse. 3. Il est recommandé de traiter toute patiente atteinte d'ostéoporose. Après une fracture de fragilité, le risque de fracture subséquente est à son comble dans les 12 à 24 mois qui suivent (risque de fracture imminente). La pharmacothérapie doit être instaurée sans tarder après une fracture de fragilité (forte, élevée). 4. Les bisphosphonates peuvent être prescrits aux patientes atteintes d'ostéoporose avec un risque intermédiaire de fracture en l'absence de toute contre-indication, idéalement pour un maximum de 5 ans (forte, élevée). Le risque de fracture doit être réévalué après 3 à 5 ans de traitement par bisphosphonates, et il convient d'envisager une pause thérapeutique (forte, moyenne). 5. Le dénosumab peut être pris pendant un maximum de 10 ans par les patientes à risque élevé ou très élevé de fracture qui présentent un calcium sérique normal (corrigé en tenant compte de l'albumine ou du calcium ionisé), une concentration adéquate de vitamine D et un débit de filtration glomérulaire estimé de &gt; 15 ml/min/1,73 m2. Si le traitement au dénosumab est arrêté, il y a lieu de le remplacer par une autre option thérapeutique (forte, élevée). 6. Le romosozumab peut être prescrit aux personnes à risque élevé ou très élevé de fracture pour un traitement d'une durée maximale d'un (1) an (forte, élevée). Après un an de traitement, il y a lieu de remplacer le romosozumab par un agent inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse (forte, modérée). Le romosozumab est contre-indiqué en cas d'antécédent récent d'infarctus du myocarde ou d'accident vasculaire cérébral et chez les patientes à risque élevé d’événement cardiovasculaire indésirable majeur. 7. Le traitement par tériparatide ou abaloparatide (pendant ≤ 2 ans) peut être prescrit aux patientes à risque élevé ou très élevé de fracture, et il y a lieu de le faire suivre d'un agent inhibiteur de la résorption osseuse (forte, élevée). Il est déconseillé de prescrire la tériparatide et l'abaloparatide chez les patientes avec antécédent de cancer, de radiothérapie, d'hypercalcémie ou d'hyperparathyroïdie. 8. Le raloxifène ou le bazédoxifène peuvent être prescrits aux femmes ménopausées ayant un risque intermédiaire de fracture ainsi qu'un risque accru de cancer du sein et un faible risque de maladie thromboembolique (conditionnelle, non classifiée). 9. Le traitement hormonal de la ménopause peut être prescrit aux femmes ménopausées qui manifestent des symptômes ménopausiques, qui n'ont aucun antécédent de cancer du sein ou de maladie thromboembolique et qui ont un faible risque de maladie cardiovasculaire ou d'atteinte cérébrovasculaire si elles ont moins de 60 ans et un risque de fracture faible, intermédiaire ou élevé (conditionnelle, moyenne). 10. L'adoption d'un programme quotidien d'exercices avec mise en charge et d'une alimentation riche en calcium avec une supplémentation adéquate en vitamine D est recommandée (forte, élevée). Il y a également lieu d'insister sur l'importance de limiter la consommation d'alcool et d'abandonner le tabagisme (forte, moyenne). © 2022

AB  - Background Higher viral loads in SARS-CoV-2 infections may be linked to more rapid spread of emerging variants of concern (VOC). Rapid detection and isolation of cases with highest viral loads, even in pre- or asymptomatic individuals, is essential for the mitigation of community outbreaks. Methods and findings In this study, we analyze Ct values from 1297 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient saliva samples collected at the Clemson University testing lab in upstate South Carolina. Samples were identified as positive using RT-qPCR, and clade information was determined via whole genome sequencing at nearby commercial labs. We also obtained patient-reported information on symptoms and exposures at the time of testing. The lowest Ct values were observed among those infected with Delta (median: 22.61, IQR: 16.72–28.51), followed by Alpha (23.93, 18.36–28.49), Gamma (24.74, 18.84–30.64), and the more historic clade 20G (25.21, 20.50–29.916). There was a statistically significant difference in Ct value between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01), as well as between Alpha and 20G (p.adj<0.05). Additionally, pre- or asymptomatic patients (n = 1093) showed the same statistical differences between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01); however, symptomatic patients (n = 167) did not show any significant differences between clades. Our weekly testing strategy ensures that cases are caught earlier in the infection cycle, often before symptoms are present, reducing this sample size in our population. Conclusions COVID-19 variants Alpha and Delta have substantially higher viral loads in saliva compared to more historic clades. This trend is especially observed in individuals who are pre- or asymptomatic, which provides evidence supporting higher transmissibility and more rapid spread of emerging variants. Understanding the viral load of variants spreading within a community can inform public policy and clinical decision making. Copyright: © 2022 King et al.

AB  - Background: As with any epidemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evoked panic, fear and misconceptions. The risk communication pillar of the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre is responding to the pandemic by facilitating correct and consistent information to enable the adoption of behaviours to prevent and control COVID-19. This study explored awareness, perception and practice of COVID-19 prevention among residents in Rivers State, Nigeria, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional survey among 1294 adult residents across all districts of the state. It employed an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Knowledge was graded as excellent for scores of ≥80%, good for scores of 50-79% and poor for scores of <50%. Respondents who washed all critical parts of their hands were categorised as adopting correct handwashing practice. Regression modelling was employed to determine predictors of knowledge and practice of COVID-19 prevention with p=0.05. Results: The respondents were aged 18-80 y with an average age of 39.6 (SD=11.9) y. A total of 710 (54.9%) were male, 476 (36.8%) were unemployed with 685 (52.9%) having secondary education. The most common sources of information about COVID-19 were radio jingles (1102; 86.7%) and television adverts (940; 74.0%). Overall, 608 (47.0%) of the respondents had a poor knowledge of COVID-19. About 443 (34.9%) respondents believed they were unlikely to contract the virus. Only 505 (39.0%) of respondents washed all the critical parts of their hands correctly. Occupation (adjusted OR [AOR]=1.39, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.82, p=0.01), level of education (AOR=4.71, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.68, p<0.001) and location (AOR=1.75, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.38; p<0.001) significantly predicted respondents' knowledge about COVID-19. The significant predictors of practice of COVID-19 were age (AOR=0.60, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.84, p=0.003), occupation (AOR=1.93, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.63, p<0.001), location (AOR=2.35, 95% CI 1.65 to 3.34, p<0.001) and knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR=7.75, 95% CI 5.94 to 10.11, p<0.001). Conclusions: Broadcast media has a pivotal role to play in risk communication for behavioural change for the control of current and future epidemics in this population. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - We aimed to assess the Iranian people’s attitude and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, their concerns about the safety of vaccines, and their reasons for accepting or rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study with a mixed qualitative–quantitative approach from December 2020 to February 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of a COVID-19 vaccine attitude questionnaire, a COVID-19 vaccine confidence inventory, a modified vaccine safety scale, and questions about participants’ decision to accept or refuse the COVID-19 vaccine, and their explanations for their decisions. The research included 1928 people with an average age of 34.88 years with 1236 (64.1%) being female. A total of 1330 participants desired to have the COVID-19 vaccine (69%). Female gender, lower educational levels, following COVID-19 news through sources other than websites and social media, not following COVID-19 news, and loss of a first-degree relative due to COVID-19 were all associated with a more negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.01). To conclude, the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among Iranians is comparable to the international average; however, it is still unfavorable. There are serious challenges to the vaccination program in Iran, such as older adults’ lower intention to undergo the COVID-19 vaccine and misinformation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the education sector of most countries. One of the basic CDC prevention guidelines is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the health of students and staff members to curve the spread of COVID-19. The current study aimed to examine the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of students at the Namibia University of Technology toward the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted using a closed-ended questionnaire. Data were collected from full-time students who were on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic between 29 January to 14 February 2021. The average knowledge about the modes of transmission, protective measures, and clinical symptoms ranged from 78% to 96%. About 31% of student respondents believed the virus was created in a laboratory, and 47% believed the vaccine has negative side effects and therefore, refused to take it. The three main sources of information about COVID-19 were social media (75%), television (63%), and friends and family (50%). The students had an overall positive attitude towards the implementation of NPIs. However, the importance of vaccine safety must be emphasized. Lockdowns should be lifted gradually to reduce the amount of time students are spending on online content. Reopening of classrooms for face-to-face study will bring unquestionable benefits to students and the wider economy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus pandemic has impacted health systems worldwide, with Spain being one of the most affected countries. However, little is known about the extent to which the effects of staying home, social distancing, and quarantine measures have influenced the epidemiology of patients with maxillofacial trauma. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the incidence, demographic patterns, and characteristics of maxillofacial fractures in the largest hospital in southern Spain. Material and Methods: Data from patients who underwent surgery for maxillofacial fractures during the first year of the pandemic between 16 March 2020 and 14 March 2021 (pandemic group) were retrospectively compared with a control group during the equivalent period of the previous year (pre-pandemic group). The incidence was compared by weeks and by lockdown periods of the population. Demographic information, aetioloy, fracture characteristics, treatment performed, and days of preoperative stay were evaluated. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were calculated (p<0.05). Results: During the first year of the pandemic, there was a 35.2% reduction in maxillofacial fractures (n=59) compared to the pre-pandemic year (n=91, p=0.040). A significant drop was detected during the total home lockdown period of the population (p=0.028). In the pandemic group, there was a reduction in fractures due to interpersonal aggressions, an increase in panfacial fractures, a significant increase in other non-facial injuries associated with polytrauma (p=0.037), a higher number of open reduction procedures with internal fixation, and a significantly longer mean preoperative stay (p=0.016). Conclusions: The first pandemic year was associated with a decline in the frequency of maxillofacial trauma and a change in the pattern and characteristics of fractures. Inter-annual epidemiological knowledge of maxillofacial fractures may be useful for more efficient planning of resource allocation and surgical practice strategy during future coronavirus outbreaks and population lockdowns. © 2022, Medicina Oral S.L..

AB  - Background: To date, public health policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have been evaluated on the basis of their ability to reduce transmission and minimise economic harm. We aimed to assess the association between COVID-19 policy restrictions and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: In this longitudinal analysis, we combined daily policy stringency data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker with psychological distress scores and life evaluations captured in the Imperial College London-YouGov COVID-19 Behaviour Tracker Global Survey in fortnightly cross-sections from samples of 15 countries between April 27, 2020, and June 28, 2021. The mental health questions provided a sample size of 432 642 valid responses, with an average of 14 918 responses every 2 weeks. To investigate how policy stringency was associated with mental health, we considered two potential mediators: observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. Countries were grouped on the basis of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic as those pursuing an elimination strategy (countries that aimed to eliminate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within their borders) or those pursuing a mitigation strategy (countries that aimed to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission). Using a combined dataset of country-level and individual-level data, we estimated linear regression models with country-fixed effects (ie, dummy variables representing the countries in our sample) and with individual and contextual covariates. Additionally, we analysed data from a sample of Nordic countries, to compare Sweden (that pursued a mitigation strategy) to other Nordic countries (that adopted a near-elimination strategy). Findings: Controlling for individual and contextual variables, higher policy stringency was associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients β=0·014 [95% CI 0·005 to 0·023] for psychological distress; β=–0·010 [–0·015 to –0·004] for life evaluation). Pandemic intensity (number of deaths per 100 000 inhabitants) was also associated with higher mean psychological distress scores and lower life evaluations (standardised coefficients β=0·016 [0·008 to 0·025] for psychological distress; β=–0·010 [–0·017 to –0·004] for life evaluation). The negative association between policy stringency and mental health was mediated by observed physical distancing and perceptions of the government's handling of the pandemic. We observed that countries pursuing an elimination strategy used different policy timings and intensities compared with countries pursuing a mitigation strategy. The containment policies of countries pursuing elimination strategies were on average less stringent, and fewer deaths were observed. Interpretation: Changes in mental health measures during the first 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic were small. More stringent COVID-19 policies were associated with poorer mental health. Elimination strategies minimised transmission and deaths, while restricting mental health effects. Funding: None. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the multiple vulnerabilities of people living in urban informal settlements globally. To bring community voices from such settlements to the center of COVID-19 response strategies, we undertook a study in the urban informal settlements of Dharavi, Mumbai, from September 2020-April 2021. In this study, we have examined the awareness, attitudes, reported practices, and some broader experiences of the community in Dharavi with respect to COVID-19. We have used a mixed-methods approach, that included a cross-sectional survey of 468 people, and in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 49 people living in this area. Data was collected via a mix of phone and face-to-face interviews. We have presented here the descriptive statistics from the survey and the key themes that emerged from our qualitative data. People reported high levels of knowledge about COVID-19, with television (90%), family and friends (56%), and social media (47%) being the main sources of information. The knowledge people had, however, was not free of misconceptions and fear; people were scared of being forcefully quarantined and dying alone during the early days of COVID-19. These fears had negative repercussions in the form of patient-related stigma and hesitancy in seeking healthcare. A year into the pandemic, however, people reported a shift in attitudes from ‘extreme fear to low fear’ (67% reported perceiving low/no COVID risk in October 2020), contributing to a general laxity in following COVID-appropriate behaviors. Currently, the community is immensely concerned about the revival of livelihoods, that have been adversely impacted due to the lockdown in 2020 as well as the continued ‘othering’ of Dharavi for being a COVID hotspot. These findings suggest that urban informal settlements like Dharavi need community-level messaging that counters misinformation and denial of the outbreak; local reinforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviours; and long-term social protection measures. © 2022 Ramani et al.

AB  - Background: Attitude is a relatively permanent inclination towards a positive or negative evaluation of a given social or physical object, which determines a person’s disposition towards their surrounding social reality and informs his/her behavior. Aims: The aim of this study is to assess the attitudes of nursing staff, in terms of the emotional and behavioral components, in relation to selected social groups: a Roma person, a hearing-impaired person, a Muslim, and a person of a homosexual orientation. Design: This cross-sectional study was conducted by means of an Internet questionnaire. Methods: This study included 3900 nurses from Poland who were participants in social networking sites and discussion groups for nurses. The study data were collected by using a self-constructed survey questionnaire. The results were reported using the STROBE Checklist. Results: The following scale was adopted: mean 1.0–3.5—positive attitude, 3.6–6.0—negative attitude. Respondents showed positive attitudes towards patient groups (1.67–2.30), the least positive being towards Muslims (2.30) and Roma (2.21). The respondents predicted that during the performance of professional activities, they would have the biggest problem with a person of homosexual orientation (22.1%) or a Muslim person (19.0%). The results show that the age and length of service most often influence attitudes towards patients from different social groups. Conclusions: Respondents with a longer period of work experience and respondents with lower education, despite declaring positive attitudes towards the surveyed social groups, expressed negative statements towards Muslims and homosexuals. Cultural education during the undergraduate and postgraduate studies of nursing staff is essential. Impact Statement: This research indicates that the lesser the need for direct involvement in interactions with patients from other groups, the greater the willingness to accept the situation in which care is provided. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Considerable research has shown that religion operates as a protective factor for one’s health. However, there is still a lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which religion is linked to individual health and wellbeing, especially in predominantly secular societies. This study tried to address this gap by developing a theoretical model to examine how religiosity is related to life satisfaction and health perception in a non-Western culture. Macau, a Portuguese colony until 1999, remains a diversified culture because of its intermixed historical background from the East and the West. Through structural equation modeling, the analysis of data collected from a representative sample of Macau residents, using a multistage stratified sampling procedure, indicated a positive link between religiosity and health. Moreover, altruism and prejudice mediated a portion of the relationship between religiosity and health. Additionally, our results demonstrated that Macau residents who were more religious had a higher level of altruism and a lower level of prejudice. The link between religion and prejudice in Macau differs from that of many other cultures, indicating that the effect of religion on prejudice varies by cultural context. In sum, our study showed that even in the shadow of glittering casinos, religion is positively related to health. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic during lockdown has highlighted the importance of identifying individuals most at risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2, underscoring the need to assess factors contributing to susceptibility to disease. With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic and its new variants, there is an inadequate understanding on whether there are certain factors such as a specific symptom or collection of symptoms that combined with life-style behaviors may be useful to predict susceptibility. The study aims to explore such factors from pre-vaccination data to guide public health response to potential new waves. Methods: An anonymous electronic survey was distributed through social media during the lockdown period in the United States from April to June 2020. Respondents were questioned regarding COVID testing, presenting symptoms, demographic information, comorbidities, and confirmation of COVID-19 test results. Stepwise logistic regression was used to identify predictors for COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. Selected classifiers were assessed for prediction performance using area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis. Results: A total of 130 participants deemed as susceptible because they self-reported their perception of having COVID-19 (but without the evidence of positive test) were compared with 130 individuals with documented negative test results. Participants had a mean age of 45 years, and 165 (63%) were female. Final multivariable model showed significant associations with perceived susceptibility for the following variables: fever (OR:33.5; 95%CI: 3.9,85.9), body ache (OR:3.0; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), contact history (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1,6.4), age> 50 (OR:2.7; 95%CI:1.1, 6.6) and smoking (OR:3.3; 95%CI: 1.2,9.1) after adjusting for other symptoms and presence of comorbid conditions. The AUROC ranged from poor to fair (0.65–0.76) for cluster of symptoms but improved to a good model (AUROC = 0.803) after inclusion of sociodemographic and lifestyle behaviors e.g., age and smoking tobacco. Conclusions: Fever and body aches suggest association with perceived COVID-19 susceptibility in the presence of demographic and lifestyle behaviors. Using other constitutional and respiratory symptoms with fever and body aches, the parsimonious classifier correctly predicts 80.3% of COVID-19 perceived susceptibility. A larger cohort of respondents will be needed to study and refine classifier performance in future lockdowns and with expected surge of new variants of COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This article provides a deep dive into several recent cases of majoritarian hate speech and violence perpetrated against Muslims in India. We first provide an introduction to Hindutva as a social movement in India, followed by an examination of three case studies in which Islamophobic hate speech circulated on social media, as well as several instances of anti-Muslim violence. These case studies—the Delhi riots, the Love Jihad conspiracy theory, and anti-Muslim disinformation related to the COVID pandemic—show that Hindu nationalism in India codes the Muslim minority in the country as particularly dangerous and untrustworthy. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Substantial changes occurred in Australian healthcare provision during the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the risk of infection transmission. Little is known about the impact of these changes on childbearing women. Aim: To explore and describe childbearing women's experiences of receiving maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. Methods: A qualitative exploratory design using semi-structured interviews was used. Women were recruited through social media and self-nominated to participate in an interview. Maximum variation sampling was used. Twenty-seven interviews were conducted with women from across Australia. Data was analysed thematically. Findings: Three primary themes and nine sub-themes emerged: ‘navigating a changing health system’ (coping with constant change, altered access to care, dealing with physical distancing restrictions, and missing care), ‘desiring choice and control’ (experiencing poor communication, making hard decisions, and considering alternate models of care), and ‘experiencing infection prevention measures’ (minimising the risk of exposure and changing care plans to minimise infection risk). Discussion: The substantial changes in care delivery for pregnant and postpartum women during the pandemic appear to have reduced woman-centred care. In most cases, care was perceived as impersonal and incomplete, resulting in a very different experience than expected; consequences included missing care. The presence of a known care provider improved women's sense of communication, choice, and control. Conclusion: This study provides unique insight into the experiences of childbearing women across Australia. The importance of respectful woman-centred care cannot be forgotten during a pandemic. The findings may inform future service planning during pandemics and disaster situations. © 2021 Australian College of Midwives

AB  - Scientific achievements concerning the direct relation between personality traits and positive orientation among patients with multiple sclerosis do not explain the role of potential mediators. In fact, some researchers argue that the traits–positivity association is much more complex than it seems to be. For this reason, we made an attempt to analyze the indirect relationship between the above-mentioned variables, including meaning in life as a mediator. In total, 618 patients with MS took part in the study. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory, the Positive Orientation Scale, and the Meaning in Life Questionnaire were used. The results showed that positive orientation/the presence of meaning/searching for meaning correlated positively with extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and were negatively associated with neuroticism. Moreover, meaning in life in both its dimensions acted as a mediator in 9 of 10 models. It can be assumed that a propensity to establish interpersonal relationships (extraversion), use active imagination (openness), inspire confidence among others (agreeableness), and take responsibility (conscientiousness) can have an impact on someone’s positive attitude toward oneself and the surrounding world (positive orientation) when people have meaning in life and when they are seeking it. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Precautionary measures (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing, washing hands regularly) to limit the transmission of the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) have been put in place worldwide. However, a limited understanding of precautionary measures and low compliance with them has been observed in older adults with neurocognitive disorders, persons with intellectual disability, or mental illness. The objective of this study is to create and evaluate a robot-mediated activity to deliver information on COVID-19 precautionary measures in an accessible and engaging way using the humanoid robot Nao. An interactive scenario explaining and demonstrating COVID-19 precautionary measures is created using the verbal and non-verbal behaviours of the robot. The scenario (≈5 min) is presented to 124 users of a geriatric hospital, including the following: older patients (n = 45), accompanying persons (n = 39), and health professionals (n = 40). The data regarding perceived usefulness, acceptability, and accessibility are collected using a questionnaire. A video analysis of the participants’ behaviour during the interaction with the robot is performed to examine the quality of engagement in the activity. The results show a good acceptance, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the robot-mediated activity. These findings suggest that robot-mediated interventions using humanoid robots can be an effective tool for the delivery of health promotion information. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted perinatal mental health globally. We determined the maternal factors and pandemic-related experiences associated with clinically significant perinatal (pregnant and post-partum) depressive symptoms in Australian women. Participants (n = 2638; pregnant n = 1219, postnatal n = 1419) completed an online survey (August 2020 through February 2021) and self-reported on depression, social support, and COVID-19 related experiences. We found elevated depressive symptoms amongst 26.5% (pregnant) and 19% (postnatal) women. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed higher likelihood of elevated depression associated with residence in Victoria, lower education, past/current mental health problems, greater non-pandemic prenatal stress, age ≥ 35 years (pregnant women) and existing physical health issues or disability in self or others (postnatal women). Greater family stress/discord and lower social support (friends) was associated with higher odds of elevated perinatal depression, while lower social support (family) was significantly associated with elevated depressive symptoms in pregnant women. Greater depression was associated with social distancing, pandemic-related news exposure and changes to prenatal care (pregnant women). Single postnatal women showed lower odds of elevated depression than partnered women. Our findings underscore the importance of universal screening for depression and targeted support during a pandemic for perinatal women displaying vulnerability factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, television and social media informed and entertained people. This cross-sectional study among adolescents and young adults (n = 859, 71.94% female, Mage = 20.55, SDage = 4.59) examined the associations between pro- and anti-governmental (social) media and youth's violations of the lockdown measures following the prototype willingness model (PWM). Data were collected during Belgium's first and strictest lockdown. The results largely confirmed the applicability of the PWM in a public health context. Posting of and exposure to anti-governmental social media messages positively related to violations of the regulations via higher descriptive norm perceptions of peers violating the measures and positive attitudes towards violations. Pro-governmental media interactions (i.e., exposure to news media and pro-governmental social media messages) negatively related to violations via negative attitudes towards violations. No support emerged for the role of (televised) series, prototype favorability, or subjective norms in the PWM. Differences in posting versus exposure of social media messages were found. Posting generally related stronger to risk cognitions and behaviors compared to exposure. Gender and age moderated some of the examined relations in the PWM. Implications for media research and health campaigns are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents’ attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N = 498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N = 1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This cross-sectional study applied the intergroup contact theory in the context of transgender prejudice and examined the relationships between quality and quantity of contact and explicit and implicit anti-transgender prejudice. Additionally, the study assessed the possible mediating role of intergroup anxiety in the relationship between intergroup contact and anti-transgender prejudice. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the proposed relationships, controlling for gender, religiosity, and political conservatism. Data were collected from an online sample of 354 participants (males: n = 168; females: n = 186). As hypothesized, greater quantity of contact was uniquely related to less implicit anti-transgender prejudice, whereas greater quality of contact was uniquely related to less explicit and implicit anti-transgender prejudice. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationships between quality of contact and implicit and explicit anti-transgender prejudice but did not mediate the relationship between quantity of contact and implicit anti-transgender prejudice. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Social contact-based interventions effectively reduce stigma toward psychosis. We recently demonstrated the efficacy of a 90-second video intervention in reducing stigma. The current randomized controlled study presents four briefer videos differing in presenter's gender/race, with baseline, postintervention, and 30-day follow-up assessments. The study replicates previous findings and examine whether concordance of presenter's and viewer's race/gender enhanced the anti-stigma effect. Methods: Using a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 1993 participants ages 18–35 years to one of four brief video-based interventions (Black/White female, Black/White male presenters) or a nonintervention control condition. In the videos, a young presenter with psychosis humanized their illness through an evocative description of living a meaningful and productive life. Results: Group-by-time ANOVA showed a significant group-by-time interaction for the total score of all five stigma domains: social distance, stereotyping, separateness, social restriction, and perceived recovery. One-way ANOVA showed greater reductions in video intervention groups than control at post-intervention and 30-day follow-up, but no differences between video groups. Matching race/gender did not further reduce stigma. Conclusions: This randomized controlled study replicated and extended previous research findings, by showing stigma reduction across videos that differ in the presenter's gender and race, thus enhancing generalizability. The videos described the experience of psychosis and reduced stigma, suggesting their potential utility on social media platforms to increase the likelihood of seeking services and ultimately may improve access to care among young individuals with psychosis. Future research should address intersectional stigma experiences by focusing on race/gender and culturally tailoring the narrative. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A lack of health care provider knowledge and training has been identified as one factor that contributes to health disparities for sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. OBJECTIVE: To explore occupational therapy practitioners' self-reported knowledge about, clinical preparedness for, and attitudes toward working with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) clients. DESIGN: Online survey of occupational therapy practitioners. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Respondents were recruited by means of snowball sampling through social media groups, state occupational therapy association websites, and emails. Surveys were posted to electronic occupational therapy social media sites. MEASURES: Knowledge, clinical preparedness, and attitudes were measured using the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Development of Clinical Skills Scale (LGBT-DOCSS). Information about demographic characteristics, education, and workplace was also collected. RESULTS: Five hundred eighty-nine occupational therapy practitioners responded to the survey. Degree level (master's vs. bachelor's or less), continuing education (minimum 1-2 hr of LGBT-specific training), practice setting (mental health), minority sexual orientation, and having a close friend or family member who identifies as SGM were associated with higher mean scores on the LGBT-DOCSS. Higher religiosity and frequency of religious practice were associated with lower scores on knowledge and attitudinal awareness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Occupational therapy practitioners often care for clients from backgrounds and cultures that differ from their own. Identifying gaps in education and opportunities for fostering LGBT-positive attitudes can facilitate the development of programs to improve practice with LGBT clients and help measure the effectiveness of such programs. What This Article Adds: This study provides evidence that a basic level of continuing education can improve occupational therapy practitioners' knowledge of and skills for working with LGBT populations and highlights the need to examine and change structural biases.

AB  - Climate change can only be tackled with public support for sustainable policies. Thus, public attitudes towards climate change matter. More than 3 decades of climate change opinion (CCO) research—conducted by geographers, environmental psychologists, behavioural scientists, sociologists etc.—have provided us with a wealth of information about which predictors shape public CCOs. This review synthesises these findings and highlights the different geographies (the self, the nation, the region, the digital) that emerge within this research. Given the increased importance of social media, virtual geographies of climate change scepticism are increasingly being identified. Our paper argues that new research agendas must be developed to address the meshwork of virtual space and small scale geographies (regions, towns, districts) in which CCOs are formed. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This research demonstrates the usefulness of the integrative model of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the perceived contingency model in predicting the users’ adoption of AI-driven personalization in digital news platforms. We conducted an online survey with 1369 US adults randomly drawn from the national panel of Qualtrics. The results show that perceived contingency plays a crucial role in predicting the adoption of AI-powered news platforms, showing a significant direct effect and an indirect effect mediated by enhanced user engagement experience and positive attitude. Furthermore, the TAM variables are still important in predicting adoption behavior. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: How nursing students perceive themselves as potential nurses in the future is defined as their nursing professional identity. Many undergraduate nursing students present positive attitudes regarding the use of social media. However, the influence of social media usage by undergraduate nursing students on the development of their professional identity is yet to be determined. Objective: To determine the relationship between social media usage by undergraduate nursing students and the development of their professional identity. Design: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study. Setting(s): Two universities in western Saudi Arabia. Participants: Undergraduate nursing students who used social media. Methods: An online questionnaire was designed, and its contents were validated. It was then distributed via a Qualtrics link to students' email addresses and via social media between 4th September 2019 and 28th October 2019. Descriptive analysis including frequencies, percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges were reported. Additionally, a number of non-parametric tests were conducted to investigate the relationships in question. Results: In total, 484 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The participants who used social media for educational (p = 0.004), or for professional purposes (p = 0.015) had high scores on the PI scale. The professional identity scores were also positively associated among the participants who followed nurses (p < 0.001), shared their nursing experiences (p < 0.001), and acted as societal educators about the nursing profession (p < 0.001) on social media platforms. Conclusions: Engagement with social media positively influenced undergraduate nursing students in the development of their professional identity. However, it is notable that the pedagogy of nursing education has been slow to adopt social media into nursing curricula. Nursing students require guidance in terms of how to use social media for their professional development. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Conspiracy theories often emerge during public health crises, and can provide some explanation for the causes behind the crises. However, the prevalence of conspiracy theories also poses a serious threat to public health order and hinders the implementation of disease prevention and control measures. No studies have examined the role of multiple risk perceptions in the formation of beliefs in conspiracy theories from a cognitive perspective in the context of the epidemic. In this cross-sectional study, participants filled in an online survey in order to investigate the relationship between epidemic severity and beliefs in conspiracy theories and the mediating role of risk perception in this relationship. The results showed that COVID-19 epidemic severity positively predicted beliefs in both in-and out-group conspiracy theories. Risk perception mediated the positive relationship between COVID-19 epidemic severity and belief in in-group conspiracy theories. These results suggest that in a major public health crisis event: (1) residents at the epicenter may be more prone to believing in both in-and out-group conspiracy theories; and (2) beliefs in in-and out-group conspiracy theories may have different psychological mechanisms. Therefore, conspiracy theories about public health incidents, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, should be classified and treated by policy stakeholders. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: There is continued scientific debate regarding the link between risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity and tobacco and cannabis use. The way this topic is presented in news media coverage may influence public attitudes and behavior and is thus an important topic of investigation. This study examines (1) the extent to which Israeli news media reported a positive (i.e., protective/therapeutic), negative (i.e., harmful), or inconclusive association between three types of substance use (tobacco, medical cannabis, recreational cannabis) and risk of COVID-19 infection and/or increased disease severity, and (2) the extent that this media coverage refers to scientific research. Methods: A quantitative content analysis of news articles related to tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 (N = 113) from eleven of the highest circulation newspapers in Israel. Results: News items were significantly more likely to mention increased COVID-19 risk for tobacco use, compared to cannabis use. All medical cannabis news items reported that medical cannabis use was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. In contrast, news items about recreational cannabis use were more likely to describe a balanced or inconclusive risk for COVID-19, or increased risk. The majority of articles referred to scientific research. Conclusion: While Israeli news media reported a relatively consistent message about the increased risk of COVID-19 in relation to tobacco use, messages about cannabis use were less consistent in communicating risk information. Research should examine effects of media coverage of tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 on public perceptions and behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The conflict of a doctor presenting as a patient is very much perceived in healthcare profession. Often overlooked, the well-being of physicians is an essential prerequisite to the health services they provide to their patients. Hence we aimed to assess the healthcare access behaviours of doctors of Saveetha Medical College and Hospital, Chennai, India and analyse barriers experienced by them in accessing healthcare. Methods: After obtaining Institutional ethical clearance, all consenting doctors were administered a structured, validated questionnaire via WhatsApp and SMS. Means and proportions were calculated and Pearson's Chi-square test of significance was used to identify association among variables. Results: Poor health-access behaviour was observed among majority of the 111 doctors who participated in the study. Familial involvement in healthcare was reported with 65% allowing their family to intervene in their health matters and 78.5% seeking consultation from their medically-qualified relatives. Younger (p = 0.026) and less experienced doctors (p = 0.18) were significantly more satisfied with self-treatment with no need felt for a primary care physician. Majority (75.7%) of doctors were inclined to informally consult for their personal medical conditions before seeking formal care. The respondents who weren't taking prescription medicines had significantly (p = 0.01) positive attitudes towards healthcare access. The major barriers in healthcare access were preference for informal consultations; worry about imposition on other busy doctors, pressure to stay healthy and long duty hours. Conclusion: Indian doctors identified significant barriers in healthcare access. Strategies directed at enhancing doctors’ healthcare access should focus on tackling their professional culture of self-reliance. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Oncology telemedicine was implemented rapidly after COVID-19. We examined multilevel correlates and outcomes of telemedicine use for patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for cancer. Methods: Upon implementation of a telemedicine platform at a comprehensive cancer center, we analyzed 468 consecutive patient RT courses from March 16, 2020 to June 1, 2020. Patients were categorized as using telemedicine during ≥1 weekly oncologist visits versus in-person oncologist management only. Temporal trends were evaluated with Cochran-Armitage tests; chi-squared test and multilevel multivariable logistic models identified correlates of use and outcomes. Results: Overall, 33% used telemedicine versus 67% in-person only oncologist management. Temporal trends (ptrend &lt; 0.001) correlated with policy changes: uptake was rapid after local social-distancing restrictions, reaching peak use (35% of visits) within 4 weeks of implementation. Use declined to 15% after national “Opening Up America Again” guidelines. In the multilevel model, patients more likely to use telemedicine were White non-Hispanic versus Black or Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–4.72; p = 0.04) or receiving ≥6 fractions of RT versus 1–5 fractions (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.29–8.80; p &lt; 0.001). Model intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated 43% utilization variation was physician-level driven. Treatment toxicities and 30-day emergency visits or unplanned hospitalizations did not differ for patients using versus not using telemedicine (p &gt; 0.05, all comparisons). Conclusion: Though toxicities were similar with telemedicine oncology management, there remained lower uptake among non-White patients. Continuing strategies for oncology telemedicine implementation should address multilevel patient, physician, and policy factors to optimize telemedicine's potential to surmount—and not exacerbate—barriers to quality cancer care. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the field of psychotherapy to the need to provide treatment remotely. We discuss the question of whether remote therapy can be curative and if the electronic device used to manage these sessions unites or separates the therapist and the patient. We term the electronic device as ‘the inanimate third’ in the therapeutic process and discuss the objectivity of the device as opposed to the subjective emotional processes involved. We deal with emotional themes relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing practices, such as longing, loneliness, the perception of the future and the lost past, and the efficacy of the therapeutic stimulation of fantasy and hope. We also evaluate the possibility of existing transference and countertransference processes while working remotely. We suggest the term ‘social paradox’ to describe the situation in which an objective entity such as the digital media symbolizes both distance and intimacy as well as separation and unity. We conclude by stating that containment of the social paradox by the therapeutic dialogue is possible as the existence of the dialogue eliminates elements of the paradox. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: Vaccination for COVID-19 is an effective method of preventing complications; however, studies suggest that public attitudes toward the vaccine are heterogeneous. The objective of our study was to identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January 2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models and controlled for respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants. Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.02-3.79). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy and concerns may exacerbate existing COVID-19 health disparities in racial and ethnic groups and highlight the need to target messaging to specific populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, because these populations are at high risk for COVID-19 complications. © 2022, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

AB  - Given the salience of socialization factors on adolescence and their role in vulnerability to disasters and trauma, this study examined whether COVID-19-associated fears and impacted quality of life mediated associations between pandemic-focused family conversations and media exposure and subsequent youth mental health. A primarily Latinx sample of adolescents (N = 167; Mage = 16.2 years, 44.9% female) participated in a longitudinal (summer 2020-winter 2020) COVID-19 study. COVID-19 media exposure predicted engagement in relevant safety behaviors, which negatively impacted quality of life, which in turn predicted increased internalizing problems. COVID-19 family conversations predicted social distancing fears, which negatively impacted quality of life, which then in turn also predicted increased internalizing problems. Targeting key socialization factors may minimize negative consequences following major community trauma among adolescents. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Orders such as self-isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lockdown implemented as a protective measure against COVID-19 has allowed people to devote their excess leisure time to their appearance, cosmetics, and hygiene. Objective: To assess the skin care routine regarding hygiene and cosmetic practices among female users of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was done among 300 female social media users using purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire that included questions related to hygiene practices such as hand washing, use of hand sanitizers, bathing, hair washing, and use of certain cosmetics before and during the pandemic was used to collect all relevant data. Result: Handwashing after returning home and shaking hands with others increased during the pandemic as compared with prior practices. The frequency of using a hand sanitizer had also increased during the pandemic. There was a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of the hair removal and visits to beauty salons during the pandemic. Cosmetics were used less, although face creams and lip balm were used more. Even though most of our respondents thought pandemic practices were convenient to use, more than half of them said they wished to go back to their pre-pandemic routines once the pandemic was over. Conclusion: The study revealed an increase in washing behavior, use of facial cream, and lip balms. Moreover, a decrease in using make-up cosmetics, hair removal, and beauty salon visits during the pandemic. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Even when people hold little prejudice themselves, expectations about how members of other groups perceive them may negatively influence interracial relations. In four pre-registered experiments, each using a full intergroup design with Black and White participants, we show that people infer negative meta-attitudes from out-group members whose appearance is phenotypically prototypical, which in turn leads to less favorable orientations toward intergroup contact, independent of personal attitudes. In Experiment 1, Black Americans, but not White Americans, perceived that more phenotypically prototypical out-group members held less favorable meta-attitudes, and this explained less favorable contact orientations. In Experiment 2, this pattern emerged for both groups of participants and was particularly pronounced among individuals higher in stigma consciousness. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 with representative samples and demonstrated that the effect of phenotypic prototypicality was more pronounced among participants reporting greater previous rejection by the out-group. With few exceptions, participants in the experiments also perceived phenotypically prototypical in-group members as having less positive meta-attitudes and participants showed less favorable contact orientations toward these in-group targets. An internal meta-analysis supported the robustness of the findings in the first three experiments. In Experiment 4, direct evidence for the causal effect of the mediator meta-attitudes on orientations toward contact with in- and out-group members was obtained. In all studies, effects held controlling for participants' general intergroup attitudes and experiences, demonstrating the unique role of meta-attitudes in shaping intergroup relations. We discuss our results in light of previous research, highlight social implications, and suggest future directions. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Aim: To investigate the prevalence of infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses among children admitted to paediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Methods: From April to July 2020, a prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted in the PEDs of eight French university hospitals. Regardless of the reason for admission, a nasopharyngeal swab sample from each child was screened using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. We determined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and identified risk factors associated with a positive test. Results: Of the 924 included children (median [interquartile range] age: 4 years [1–9]; boys: 55%), 908 (98.3%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Only three samples were positive (0.3%; 95% confidence interval: 0.1–1) and none of these children had symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Of the 836 samples (90%) tested for other viruses, 129 (15.4%) were positive (primarily rhinovirus). Respiratory viruses were significantly more common in young children and in children with respiratory tract symptoms and fever. Conclusion: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children admitted to emergency departments was low. In contrast, and despite social distancing and other protective measures, the prevalence of other respiratory viruses detection was high. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Increased income inequality, and policies that can limit its further growth, are an important issue for citizens, politicians and the media. Numerous empirical studies have measured political support for redistributive policies by asking whether the government should equalize gaps between rich and poor. They try to discover whether ‘redistributive’ policies are supported by public opinion and are therefore politically feasible. This research note argues that the standard instrument measures diffuse support for more equality, but gives rather vague hints if this support is transformed into a political mandate for redistributive programmes. With regard to the way in which the political demand for state redistribution to reduce income inequality has been raised so far, methodological critique and innovation is largely lacking. This article therefore tests the validity of the standard item. It argues that the conventional measurement only captures a general ‘inclination’ towards the idea of equality. However, since the item phrasing is unspecific, other orientations confound the answers, so that ultimately the predictive power in terms of political behaviour is low. The standard item measures egalitarian preferences with inconsistence. This limits its reliability, so that hardly any conclusions can be drawn regarding voting for left parties or support for redistributive programmes. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Feminist reflexivity aims to (re)consider and challenge power differentials that exist in the research process. This activity is well represented in, for example, research into heterosexism. In this article we expand feminist reflexive practice in relation to cisgenderism through a (re)examination of interview transcripts conducted by a cisgender researcher on the topic of cisgenderism in media representations of trans and intersex sportspeople. Drawing on interviews with 18 cisgender and trans and non-binary participants, we analyse three forms of researcher collusion in cisgenderism, namely: 1) perpetuating cisgenderism in the selection of media materials; 2) assuming trans women are the referent; and 3) disunifying assumptions about trans sportspeople. This reflexive analysis is discussed with regard to how analytical insights can be generated into the operation and functioning of prejudice. In so doing, we further the conception of prejudice as a ubiquitous and latent activity in research practices. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - During the COVID-19 emergency, people must face the invisible threat of uncertain death and comply with social distancing and other related protective measures. But social networking sites (SNSs) like WeChat have emerged as alternative contexts where people can maintain self and obtain gratification, despite the disclosure of self to others often being a challenging issue. To examine the effect of personality factors on people's self-disclosure on SNSs, we develop a model based on the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory. We suggest that people's narcissism traits and two types of time perspective (i.e. future and present-hedonistic) have positive effects on their self-disclosure. In addition, we propose that virtual presence and hedonic gratification mediate the effects of both future time perspective and present-hedonistic time perspective. We obtain a sample of 516 WeChat users in China and take ex-ante and post-hoc measures to deal with common method variance. By means of partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methods, we validate both our measurement model and the structural model, so we confirm all the hypothesized causal paths in the proposed model. Our study broadens the boundaries of the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory, and offers new insights for addressing some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Objective: Prostate cancer survivors are increasingly turning to online communities for support. This study explored predictors of and barriers to use. Methods: A prospective survey of 141 Australian prostate cancer survivors assessed sociodemographic, clinical, psychosocial, and attitudinal characteristics associated with intention to use, and subsequent use of online communities. Results: The sample was divided into current, past, and non-user groups. Current users reported more intent to use online communities and had higher levels of social support. Current and past users, and their close contacts, held a more positive attitude towards use. Non-users experienced more barriers to use, fewer life impacts due to health changes, and were more likely to live in rural or remote regions. According to current users online prostate cancer communities are too informal, to past users they are too time intensive, and non-users believe they are too shallow. The most critical barriers to use were finding a suitable community, time to use them, and being capable of talking about or articulating their illness on the Internet. While these forums allow men to share experiences, gain recognition and understanding, and receive information, they may lead men to becoming too preoccupied with their illness and feeling more concerned about the consequences of their disease. Conclusion: Improving attitudes towards online communities and reducing barriers to use may help better encourage men with unmet supportive care needs to seek help from these groups. Future research exploring supporter attitudes towards use and explicating how men are supported online is needed. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Due to its near-real-time crowdsourcing nature, social media demonstrates a great potential of rapidly reflecting public opinion during emergency events. However, systematic approaches are still desired to perceive public opinion in a rapid and reliable manner through social media. This research proposes two quantitative metrics - the fraction of event-related tweets (FET) and the net positive sentiment (NPS) - to examine the intensity and direction dimensions of public opinion. While FET is modeled through normalizing population size differences, NPS is modeled through a Bayesian-based method to incorporate uncertainty from social media information. To illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed FET and NPS, we studied public opinion on society reopening amid COVID-19 for the entire United States and four individual states (i.e., California, New York, Texas, and Florida). The reflected trends of public opinion have been supported by the reopening policy timeline, the number of COVID-19 cases, and the economy characteristics. This research is expected to assist policy makers in obtaining a prompt understanding of public opinion from the intensity and direction dimensions, thereby facilitating timely and responsive policy making in emergency events. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the attitude and hesitancy toward vaccine against COVID-19 in a Pakistani Population. Materials and methods: A mix-method, prospective study was conducted and adults (aged ≥18 years) residing in Pakistan were invited to participate. The questionnaire was prepared, hosted in Google Forms and circulated through electronic platforms and was also available to be done in in-person. Data was compiled from 15th September to 30th November 2020. Results: The response rate was 80%. A total of 1003 participants were included in the final analysis. Of them, 75% completed survey questionnaire online, while remaining 25% responded in-person. The mean age of the participants was 29.62 ± 10.47 years. The majority of participants were females; 60.9% (n = 611). 57.02% (n = 572) of the participants were employed at the time of survey. Overall, 70.68% (n = 709) of the participants had previous experience of vaccines such as the flu vaccine Only 4.9% (n = 49) participants thought that they will be seriously ill from COVID-19 within six months and 39% (n = 392) participants were confident that they will get COVID-19. A total of 71.29% of the participants reported they would consider getting vaccinated once available. There was statistical association between gender and getting vaccinated (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This study demonstrated that majority of the participants showed positive attitude toward considering COVID-19 vaccine. However awareness with informed knowledge of efficacy, possible adverse effects and cost would be of added great value to increase the real response of Pakistani population toward COVID-19 vaccination. © 2021 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

AB  - In the September 2020 issue of Perspectives, Scott et al. argued that there is insufficient empirical work on White parents’ racial-socialization strategies to support generalizations about the topic and, therefore, that journalists’ recommendation that White parents discuss race and racism with their children represents a case of speculation without evidence. Although we strongly support Scott et al.’s call for additional, rigorous research on racial socialization in White families, we argue that their critique of popular-press pieces was unwarranted. Specifically, we argue that, although definitive tests of the effects of specific White parental racial-socialization strategies are lacking, the recommendation for parents to discuss race and racism with their children is both appropriate and empirically grounded. We describe research on racial socialization, intergroup contact, and cognitive development that is consistent with recommendations from developmental scientists reported in the popular press. Furthermore, we argue that parents may be the ideal socializers of racial attitudes. We conclude with a discussion of the broad context concerning media reports of findings from psychological science. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: To report changes in adult hospital admission rates for acute ENT infections following the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions such as hand washing, use of face masks and social distancing of 2-m in the United Kingdom. Methods: Retrospective cohort study comparing adult admissions with acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis, glandular fever, peri-orbital cellulitis, acute otitis media, acute mastoiditis, retropharyngeal abscess and parapharyngeal abscess in the 1-year period after the introduction of COVID-related physical interventions (2020–2021) with a 1-year period before this (2019–2020) in three UK secondary care ENT departments. Results: In total, there were significantly fewer admissions for ENT infections (n = 1073, 57.56%, p < 0.001; RR 2.36, 95% CI [2.17, 2.56]) in the 2020–2021 period than in the 2019–2020 period. There were significant reductions in admissions for tonsillitis (64.4%; p < 0.001), peritonsillar abscess (60.68%; p < 0.001), epiglottitis (66.67%; p < 0.001), glandular fever (38.79%; p = 0.001), acute otitis media (26.85%; p = 0.01) and retropharyngeal and/or parapharyngeal abscesses (45.45%; p = 0.04). Conclusion: Our study demonstrates a sizeable reduction in adult admissions for ENT infections since the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions. There is evidence to support the use of physical interventions in the prevention of viral transmission of respiratory disease. Preventing ENT infections requiring admission through simple physical interventions could be of great benefit to the quality of life of patients and economical benefit to healthcare systems. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - This study aims to investigate how daily activities affect mood in the context of social distancing guidelines enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) administered four times a day during a 2-week period, we asked participants (N = 91) about their mood and the activities they engaged in. Seven individuals were selected for a follow-up, open-ended questionnaire. Results show that a stable routine, including physical exercise, hobbies, regular sleep hours, and minimal time spent in front of the computer, helps maintain a good mood. Coping strategies such as planning and scheduling help keep routines and circadian rhythms stable. Face-to-face contact is associated with a more positive mood, while similar interaction through electronic communication has a less positive effect. We observe an effect related to the infodemic phenomenon: Daily reports on COVID-19 cases and deaths affect mood fluctuations. This is an important consideration in shaping public information policies. © 2021 The International Association of Applied Psychology.

AB  - Objective: Vaccination is one of the most important measures that the world is relying on to end the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of vaccines have been authorized; however, there are several differences in the available vaccines which may lead to differences in public hesitancy levels toward each vaccine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the young Jordanian population's acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, their knowledge, and attitudes toward different vaccine types, and to explore the variables that could influence their preferences. Material and methods: An online questionnaire was distributed via Jordanian multipurpose Facebook groups. COVID-19 knowledge, and practice scores were calculated, in addition to general and specific COVID-19 vaccine knowledge scores. Repeated measures analysis was conducted to investigate the association between the participants’ knowledge about each vaccine and their willingness to take it. Quantile regressions were conducted to determine the predictors of the participants’ willingness to take each vaccine. Results: A total of 1897 participants completed the survey. One fifth of the participants (19.9%) were willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The acceptance of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and the knowledge about it were significantly different from all the other vaccines. Predictors of acceptance of the different vaccines were sex, estimation of the severity of the disease, COVID-19 knowledge score, practice score, and specific vaccine knowledge score. Conclusion: The young Jordanian adults had limited acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Differences in the participants’ acceptance of different vaccines were observed and specific vaccine knowledge was a significant predictor of acceptance of the vaccine. © 2021 Elsevier España, S.L.U.

AB  - This study explores the mechanisms of racial discrimination in U.S. independent filmmaking. To answer this question, I combine the theoretical toolkits on Hollywood discrimination and Bourdieu’s theory of cultural production. I employ in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 30 U.S.-based independent filmmakers of color, and observations of public discussions at film festivals in the greater Los Angeles area. I find that despite independent film’s inclusive and non-commercial discourses, many of the mechanisms of racial exclusion that underlie Hollywood’s lack of diversity also exist in independent film: the economic uncertainty of creative labor, racialized market logics, the economic stigmatization of artists of color, and the reliance on closed social networks for career advancement. Furthermore, I also find that non-commercial factors in the field of independent film also constrain the ability for filmmakers of color to make art reflective of their experiences, form mutually beneficial collaborations with other artists of color, or invest their time in projects that are culturally innovative. These findings suggest that even at the margins of mainstream cultural production, mechanisms of racialization can still operate where racial prejudice and racialized economics outweigh artistic independence. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - Objective: Rural areas in the Southern United States are characterized by certain cultural values that may delay or prevent mental health service utilization. The present study examined a four-stage chain of serial mediation where higher levels of general self-reliance would be related to greater levels of public stigma, which would in turn be related to higher levels of self-stigma, followed by greater self-reliance about managing mental health problems, and finally, more negative attitudes toward seeking help from psychologists. Method: Community members who lived in rural counties in the Southern United States (N = 783) completed measures of these constructs online. Results: Mediation analyses supported a direct association between general self-reliance and attitudes toward help-seeking that was explained in serial by higher levels of public stigma, self-stigma, and mental health self-reliance. Conclusions: Clinical implications for rural practitioners are suggested including instilling policy changes, increasing provider visibility, and addressing barriers in therapy. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In recent years, LGBT issues have received substantial media attention and engendered heated public debate in Ghana. This paper analyzes the prejudiced construction of LGBT issues in the Ghanaian news media and how this contributes to a discriminatory discourse that demeans LGBT people and puts them at the periphery of Ghanaian society. The study employs a critical discourse analysis framework and a dataset of 385 articles, comprising news reports, op-ed pieces, and editorials. The analysis reveals that news content on LGBT issues is biased and inflammatory, and it frames LGBT people as expendables and undesirables. This is realized by exploiting three discourses, or forms of othering, that culminate into the (re)production and naturalization of moral panic: a discourse of amorality/immorality and societal destruction, a discourse of alienization, and a discourse of medicalization or pathologization. The paper concludes with a call for a more balanced and ethically/socially responsible news reporting, especially since LGBT issues in Ghana hold implications for national cohesion and security. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: To compare and analyze the incidence of otitis media with effusion (OME), before and during the COVID-19-related pandemic period, to evaluate the effects of the social changes (lockdown, continuous use of facial masks, social distancing, reduction of social activities) in the OME incidence in children and adults. Methods: The number of diagnosed OME in e five referral centers, between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021, has been reviewed and collected. To estimate the reduction of OME incidence in children and adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period the OME incidence in three period of time were evaluated and compared: group 1—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2018 and 01/03/2019 (not pandemic period). Group 2—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2019 and 1/03/2020 (not pandemic period). Group 3—patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2020 and 1/03/2021 (COVID-19 pandemic period). Results: In the non-pandemic periods (group 1 and 2), the incidence of OME in the five referral centers considered was similar, with 482 and 555 diagnosed cases, respectively. In contrast, the OME incidence in the same centers, during the pandemic period (group 3) was clearly reduced with a lower total number of 177 cases of OME estimated. Percentage variation in OME incidence between the first non-pandemic year considered (group 1) and the pandemic period (group 3) was—63, 3%, with an absolute value decrease value of—305 cases. Similarly, comparing the second non-pandemic year (group 2) and the pandemic year (group 3) the percentage variation of OME incidence was—68, 1% with an absolute value of—305 cases decreased. Conclusions: Our findings showed a lower incidence of OME during the pandemic period compared with 2 previous non pandemic years. The drastic restrictive anti-contagion measures taken by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID-19 could have had a positive impact on the lower OME incidence during the last pandemic year. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The secondary sneaker market is rather unique in that unlike items in other resale fashion categories (e.g., clothing), sneakers often resell for more than their original retail price. This market has risen to dizzying heights fueled by social media and collaborations with celebrities and designers which, coupled with limited availablility of merchandise, have generated great consumer demand and interest surrounding this market. The aim of this study was to investigate popular culture and social media and their influence on fashion conscious consumers interested in secondary sneaker retailers (i.e., StockX, GOAT) as well as their further impact on purchase intentions. The authors utilized the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to examine consumer behavior toward secondary sneaker retailers. The findings support the TRA, suggesting that the social mechanisms of interest (i.e., popular culture and social media) positively influence consumers, who report high levels of fashion consciousness and subsequent positive attitudes toward the secondary sneaker retailer, subjective norms, and ultimately purchase behavior vis-a-vis secondary sneakers. The findings of this study will enable industry practitioners and members of academia to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article explores persuasive applications of humour in public diplomacy. I propose a new concept of strategic humour – the use of humour by state and proxy actors to promote instrumental interpretations of contested international events to foreign and domestic publics. Through strategic humour, states frame events in ways that advance their interests, deflect external criticism, and challenge narratives of other actors. In an entertaining form, strategic humour delivers a serious message that is simple, accessible, memorable, suited to the new media ecologies, and competitive in capturing news media and public attention. I focus on Russia as a state recently involved in a range of major controversies and demonstrate its use of strategic humour in three case studies. I argue that strategic humour is a fast-emerging, multi-format tool in public diplomacy, facilitated by the rise of social media and post-truth politics and less dependent on the state’s broader power resources. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - To control COVID-19, several strategies were proposed in Iran since the start of the outbreak. The number of reported infected people and its consequent death toll herald relative inadequacies in the quality and extent of the measures in curbing the COVID-19 transmission cycle. This study was conducted to investigate knowledge, attitude, precautionary practices and degree of fear related to COVID-19 in a sample of Iranian population. This study was conducted among 457 residents of Kurdistan Province, Iran, through social networks and social media (WhatsApp and Telegram). Knowledge, attitude and practice and fear of COVID-19 were collected using valid tools. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with binary outcome attitudes, practices and continuous variables knowledge and fear of COVID-19, respectively. The mean (SD) age of participants was 37.86 (10.42); of them, 252 (55.1%) were men, and more than two-thirds were married (74.8%). About 10% of the respondents were in believed that COVID-19 could create a type of social stigma. Level of knowledge about COVID-19 in 77.8% of the study attendees was acceptable, and 352 of them (70%) were confident that the virus would eventually be successfully controlled in the world, but only 252 of the attendants (50%) had confidence about successful control of COVID-19 in Iran. Applying multiple logistic regression, knowledge (OR: 1.18, p = 0.028) and fear (OR: 1.04, p = 0.028) of COVID-19 were associated with positive attitude towards controllability of COVID-19. Gender (OR: 1.96, p = 0.012), sources of information (OR: 5.00, p = 0.005) and knowledge (OR: 1.27, p = 0.006) were also indicated association with taking precautionary practices to control COVID-19. Further studies are recommended to boost level of knowledge, strengthen positive attitude and ameliorate behavioural pattern for successful control of COVID-19 in Iran. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article introduces the conceptual distinctions between “mediated” and “immediate” Islamophobia. “Mediated” Islamophobia refers to the fact that most people who express Islamophobic sentiment do not know (m)any Muslims and know little about Islam; their knowledge about Islam and Muslims, and any Islamophobic sentiment they may have, come from the exposure to traditional and/or social media. Given the documented Islamophobic bias of many “Western” media, “mediated” Islamophobia may be on the rise. On the other hand, research has shown that what we call “immediate” Islamophobia is less of a problem: People who know Muslims personally, live close to them and are better informed about Islam, are less likely to be Islamophobic. This article uses empirical data to contribute to the discussion of immediate, face-to-face experiences of residents in two Muslim-concentration areas in Melbourne, Australia, with a reference to the “contact theory.” We analyze residents’ perceptions of Muslims and Islam based on everyday encounters with their (Muslim) neighbors, and Muslims’ perceptions and direct experiences of Islamophobia. We use data collected through a survey and follow-up interviews to support our conceptual argument. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - The Covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in January 2020. As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow-up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self-reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

AB  - Problem: Prenatal depression and anxiety are linked to poor maternal and infant outcomes. We need to understand predictors of poor mental health to identify at-risk women, and targets for support. Background: Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between low levels of perceived social support, and depression and anxiety in pregnant women. However, there is a lack of research into the factors that may mediate this relationship. Aim: As social distancing measures (e.g., lockdown) are likely to negatively affect women's perceived support in the prenatal period, we investigated the relationship between perceived social support and both anxiety and depression in UK-based pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we examined two potential mediators that may contribute to psychological symptoms: repetitive negative thinking and loneliness. Methods: We administered a battery of online measures to a sample of pregnant women (N = 205) between May-June 2020, during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, when perceived social support was likely to be low. Results: Consistent with predictions, perceived social support was significantly negatively related to depression, anxiety, loneliness and repetitive negative thinking. Furthermore, repetitive negative thinking and loneliness mediated the relationship between perceived social support and both depression and anxiety. Moreover, perceived social support and loneliness were associated with specific types of online behaviours. Conclusions: Taken together, the findings shed light on the processes through which social support may exert its effects on depression and anxiety and highlight potential therapeutic targets for interventions which aim to prevent and treat mood disorders in perinatal cohorts. © 2021 Australian College of Midwives

AB  - Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion regarding the COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during the COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors—age, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic level—on sources of information. Subject and methods: An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less. Conclusion: In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors. Researchers and policymakers can use a source of information to develop crisis-response strategies by considering variations in the demographic factors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Although nearly half of medical students are female there is still a significant discrepancy in the number of women specializing in radiology. In 2013, 26.9% of US diagnostic radiology residents were female, a 1% increase in 20 years from 25.5% in 1990. Purpose: The purpose of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the interventions implemented at a single medical school at decreasing negative attitudes about radiology held by medical students of all genders and whether those same interventions will increase the number of female medical students matching into radiology. Methods: The interventions were implemented between 2012 and 2016 and included incorporation of radiology into preclinical curriculum, electives in radiology for 3rd year students, a “Women in Radiology Panel,” and increase in female radiology faculty visibility. First year medical student participants of all genders used a free text box to write their attitudes about radiology, which were categorized into the “six most common attitudes about radiology.” Fourth year medical student participants used a free text box to write the reasons why they did not choose radiology as a specialty, and those answers were then placed into the same six categories. We then analyzed the data using Fisher's Exact Test to determine whether there was a decrease in the negative misperceptions after exposure to the interventions. We also then determined whether there was an increase in the number of women matching into radiology using Chi-Square analysis. Results: There was a decrease in the negative misperceptions between 1st and 4th years, with the most notable decrease from 51% of 1st years to 0% of 4th years listing radiologists as being antisocial (p < 0.01). There was also a significant increase in the number of female medical students matching into radiology in the years in which students were exposed to 4 years of intervention when compared to three and fewer (0.76%–4.2%, p = 0.01). Conclusion: Exposure to 4 years of the interventions demonstrated a significant increase in the female match rate into the specialty when compared to female medical students who experienced three or fewer years of intervention. Additionally, it appears that these same interventions decreased the number of students of all genders having some of the common negative misperceptions about the field of radiology. © 2020 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - During the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic a variety of social activities migrated online, including religious ceremonies and rituals. One such instance is the case of Santo Daime, a Brazilian rainforest religion that utilizes the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca in its rituals. During the pandemic, multiple Santo Daime rituals involving the consumption of ayahuasca took place online, mediated through Zoom and other online platforms. The phenomenon is notable since the effects of hallucinogens are defined by context (set and setting) and Santo Daime rituals are habitually governed by punctilious regulations aimed at directing the experience of participants. The abrupt move to online space thus augurs significant implications in the context of hallucinogenic rituals. This paper looks at this development and its repercussions for entheogenic rituals, as it asks how do psychedelic rituals change when they move online? Building on the author’s previous work on set and setting in the Santo Daime religion, the paper introduces accounts from 12 semi-structured interviews with daimistas participating in online daime rituals, approached through the prism of set and setting, and the study of online religiosity. The analysis points at several key dynamics emerging in the context of virtual rituals. The migration online allowed for the continuation of Santo Daime entheogenic rituals at a time of social distancing, fostered a sense of global brotherhood and opened new possibility for religious participation and learning. Concurrently, online ritual produced an impoverished ritual experience and novel types of challenges including a higher potential for distractions, technical difficulties, and low sensory fidelity. Other novel challenges included social anxiety and an in-built tension between the social and spiritual dimensions of ritual. Finally, some participants were concerned by the cultural context of online rituals: technological mediation, consumerism, commodification, and digital divide. The limitations of digital technology appear amplified by the highly immersive, body oriented, experientially intensified context of the psychedelic experience. This paper contributes to the literature on the extra-pharmacological factors shaping experiences with psychedelics, as well as to the literature on the consequences of the adoption of digital media technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This research probes the influence of the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on the tourism development behavior of local residents. By applying social exchange theory (SET), this study examines the impact of the community dimension on tourism development behavior through overall attitude. In addition, this study also examines the use of social media as a moderator in the relationship between overall attitude and tourism development. A survey tool has been used to obtain data from the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. Hypotheses were examined using the structural equation method (SEM) on 417 survey responses. The findings indicated community satisfaction and an overall positive attitude to the effects of development, although a negative attitude regarding concerns about community resources. Overall, attitude has a significant impact on tourism development behavior. Additionally, the use of social media strengthens the relationship between overall attitude and behavior that favors tourism development. Copyright © 2022 Shang, Pitafi and Rashid.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to address the global COVID-19 pandemic related to its sustainability, such as environmental, economic and social concerns. The short study also examined how various innovative approaches can help promote sustainable production. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology examines hypothetical scenarios of the current pandemic and tries to describe the quality of evidence to facilitate careful, critical engagement by readers. Secondary data is used to identify sustainability challenges, such as environmental, social and economic viability challenges. The information in this report was gathered from numerous media outlets, research agencies, policy papers, newspapers and other sources to gain a better knowledge of the issue. Findings: As a result, most industry executives and policymakers are looking for appropriate strategies and policies to improve their practices and meet consumer demand. The outcomes explore that the COVID-19 pandemic is a central factor in changes in people’s behavior, reflecting sustainability such as environmental, social and economic responsibility. The COVID-19 outbreak, surprisingly, had a bigger effect on sustainable consumption, accompanied by environmental sustainability, and, to a lesser extent, social and economic viability. Research limitations/implications: Limited secondary evidence and data could not scrutinize the study’s actual problem statements. Hence, it is recommended that the gap in research be fulfilled by conducting a primary survey among various groups of economists, environmentalists and industrialists using the cluster sampling technique by validating the questionnaire of the total sustainable production system. Proposing frameworks for improving the resilience of production and a systematic possible upgraded manufacturing system by using the Industry 4.0 technology during operational processes could advance market demand. Practical implications: The COVID-19 scenario has compelled manufacturing firms to put their production systems on hold for an extended period while they seek long-term solutions to assure simple delivery and cooperation from both business and consumer standpoints. Various aspects of supply and demand are discussed in the referendum, as well as production and consumption challenges during the COVID-19 era. There is a need to restore the production system and find the right source of raw materials. This work focuses on commodity inventory management systems due to mass production, but due to pandemics, it is not in demand and vice versa. The researcher made comprehensible remarks on the use of digitization in the pandemic, which improves social distancing and social well-being and promotes the production system as well. Besides, manufacturing plants should switch to digital manufacturing to reduce the number of workplaces and hence the risk of an outbreak. Therefore, a better supply chain network is needed to supply more manufacturing units. Social implications: There is a bright side of coronavirus that the public health crisis raised worldwide has brought many opportunities for governments and society to make eternal reforms in the public health sector door. During restricted movements for fulfilling market demand, the Industry 4.0 technologies for automation, mechanization and digitalization can help significantly advance a company. This technological advancement and computer digitization for the perspective people may improve the environment, economic and social sustainability also increase social media adoption, which can be crucial for agri-businesses to evaluate customers’ behavior and consumption trends. Originality/value: The paper also instructed to identify critical success factors, barriers and drivers for dealing with the pandemic situation and to develop a strategic policy framework to improve production and process flexibility through the remarkable introduction of digital manufacturing. Before it is too late to stop the spread, producers and consumers must grasp the limits to which suppliers might drive nature. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Augmented reality (AR) has received massive attention in online retail. Therefore, the paper aims to review the state-of-the-art literature on AR in online retailing, by identifying the antecedents, drives, outcomes, theoretical lenses, typology and methodological approaches. The study further aims to identify the critical avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: To advance the conceptual and managerial understanding of AR, the study synthesizes the literature through a systematic literature review approach by reviewing 53 articles. Findings: Several AR characteristics significantly influence utilitarian, hedonic, perceived risk and experiential value, ultimately resulting in a positive attitude, decision-making assistance and behavioural intentions, wherein customer experience (flow, spatial presence, mental imagery and immersion) plays a mediating role in the process. The study also lists the top authors, articles, journals, countries, theories and methodology used. Originality/value: The study provides a comprehensive framework on consumer behaviour towards AR in online retailing. Further, the study proposes the future research agenda in the social side of AR, the dark side of AR, customer engagement, use of AR for experiential value and AR marketing domain. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Booming mobile shopping has resulted in an increase use of m-payment. Although m-payment is still in its infancy in Thailand, it has started to affect the daily lives of Thai people. This study aims to understand the role of perceive risks in influencing millennials' intention to use m-payment for mobile shopping. Design/methodology/approach: The sample covers 250 millennials in Bangkok who were surveyed between February to May 2019. Purposive sampling and convenient sampling were applied to collect data. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied for statistical analysis. Further, mediation effect of attitude was studied. Findings: The results showed that only perceived time risk significantly but negatively affect millennials' attitude towards using m-payment. Moreover, mediation test confirms that the relationship between perceived time risk and intention to use m-payment is mediated by attitude. Research limitations/implications: First, limited number of respondents cannot be a representative of millennials as a whole. Second, the study is limited to a general study, in which the results of m-payment might not be effectual to explain other scenarios (e.g. offline setting) and the market situation in another cultural context. Practical implications: It is important that business practitioners should formulate less complicated system under the most decent transaction time to elicit positive attitude towards m-payment. Also, message should emphasize on the time being saved and simplicity of the m-payment. Originality/value: Since the study of how perceived risks influence millennials intention to m-payment remains insufficient in Southeast Asian context especially in Thailand, this paper contributes to the updating of empirical findings to the existing literatures. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Families with young children have faced serious challenges during the first lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to remote working, parents have had to monitor their children’s schoolwork and manage their daily lives. When one of the children also has neuro-developmental disorders, this results in an increased burden. We can therefore wonder how these families with one or more young children (under 6 years old) with special needs have experienced and dealt with this lockdown. Aim of the Study: In this context, the “COVJEUNENFANT” study focused more specifically on the subjective experience, as a parent, of those who cared for children with special needs (i.e., with developmental disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, proven disabilities or chronic health conditions) compared to the general population. We wished to see if the consequences of the health crisis were significantly different from those perceived by respondents in the general population (n = 490) and if the sociodemographic structure of these families differed from those of other respondents. Methods: Ninety three French families with at least one child under 6 years old and one with developmental difficulties or a chronic illness, from a cohort of 490 control families, participated in a web-based survey during the first lockdown, from the 28th April 2020 to 29th May 2020. Results: After presenting the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, the results show that these French families (n = 93) are less wealthy than the control population “without special needs” (n = 397), have felt more pressures originating from their environment (families, friends, colleagues, media, social networks…), have suffered from more health issues (other than COVID-19), have taken more measures to protect themselves (social-distancing), and were less likely to feel happy. A significantly larger number of them lamented the lack of free time and voiced a larger need for information regarding children’s education. However, their parental role was felt as being more satisfying and their family relations strengthened more than in the general population of participants. Conclusion: It is apparent that urgent prioritisation is needed in order to support and care for these families by continuing to provide care for their children in one way or another, and by ensuring that their need to adapt again does not exceed their own abilities and resources, especially as young children, who have high levels of requirements, are present in the home.

AB  - Background: There is widespread prejudice in veterinary medicine that gout does not occur in non-human mammalians. However, we recently discovered monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid obtained from a few dogs and a cat. Since it is the definitive and gold standard to diagnose gout, we report these cases as newly emerging diseases in companion animals. Case Presentation: Four dogs and one cat were presented at our hospital because of lameness due to an unknown cause. Even after the routine examinations, including radiographic imaging, laboratory examination, and arthrocentesis, we were unable to find a clear cause of polyarthritis. However, we later discovered monosodium urate crystals in the synovial fluid of the animals, confirmed by polarized microscopy. In one of the two dogs treated with immunosuppressants, the disease relapsed, and the other did not show any symptoms for 3 months. The other two dogs were treated with xanthine oxidase inhibitor, where one died, and the other did not show any symptoms for 3 years. The cat was treated with drainage and intra-articular dexamethasone injection, but the disease recurred after 6 months. Conclusion: This is the first report to confirm that articular gout can occur in dogs and cats. Care must be taken not to neglect needle-shaped materials in the synovial fluid. Gout should also be included in the differential diagnosis of arthritis and further research is needed in these animals. Copyright © 2022 Kim, Hwang, Kim and Do.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aimed to examine the sources of information and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The COVID-19 pandemic affected at a large level of all social institutions including the healthcare system of the countries. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted in Pakistan by using an online survey technique. The rationale to opt for this method was based on the country’s lockdown situations, social distancing and the care of the respondents. A total of 847 individuals from different parts of the Punjab province participated in the study. An attitudinal scale was administered, which consisted of statements to measure (dis)agreement among the individuals on current situations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ethical considerations and confidentiality of the respondents were opted by describing the purpose of research on the first page of the questionnaire. Findings: The study findings revealed that peer group, signs and symptoms of COVID-19 pandemic and causes and consequences of COVID-19 pandemic had favourable positive effects on the use of PPE by individuals through the mediation of fear of infection during COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the study findings were interpreted as per the effects of current situations of COVID-19 on the sources of information and the use of PPE by individuals. Originality/value: This study focused on an important gap in the research on COVID-19 pandemic in the country in terms of mass media, health practitioners, peer group, fear of infection and use of PPE. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Research shows that government-controlled media is an effective tool for authoritarian regimes to shape public opinion. Does government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to government-controlled media - in the form of TV news segments - on issues where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The behavior decisions in social dilemmas are highlighted in sociological, economic, and social psychological studies. Across two studies, the iterated prisoner’s dilemma is used as a basic paradigm to explore the effects of social distance and asymmetric reward and punishment on an individual’s cooperative behavior. Experiment 1 (N = 80) used a 2 (social distance: intimacy vs. strangeness) × 2 (symmetry of rewards: symmetric rewards vs. asymmetric rewards) within-subject design and demonstrated that when there were only two options, namely, cooperation and defection, cooperative behavior was influenced by social distance and symmetry of rewards, respectively, and the interaction was not significant. Experiment 2 (N = 80) used a 2 (social distance: intimacy vs. strangeness) × 2 (symmetry of punishment: symmetric punishment vs. asymmetric punishment) within-subject design and showed that the cooperative behavior of participants decreased when the punishment option was added, and the two levels of symmetry and asymmetry were set. Specifically, compared with the symmetric punishment group, the asymmetric punishment group was more likely to choose a defection strategy and less likely to use a punishment strategy. Moreover, there was a marginal interaction effect between social distance and symmetry of punishment, and symmetry of punishment was a significant mediator in the relationship between social distance and individual cooperation. Specifically, asymmetric punishment reduced only the cooperation rate (CR) between participants and their friends. In conclusion, in dilemma situations, asymmetric reward did not influence individual cooperative behavior at different social distances, while asymmetric punishment did, because the sense of loss was more likely to awaken an individual’s social comparison motives.

AB  - The stereotypical view of creativity as an emblem of youth, and old age as a signifier of decline can hold grave consequences for filmmakers in the second half of life, as this misconception can result in negative attitudes, a decline in media coverage, and less funding for film production. Thus, ageing male film directors might face a collisional intersection, when the gender-based status that provides social privileges, meets with older age-based status, which leads to social weakening. This qualitative study explored the means which male directors in the second half of life use to remain creative and make films in an ageist, vastly changing world. The study is based on a dataset of transcribed semi-structured interviews with 13 well-known Israeli male directors over the age of 55. The findings led to the formation of a model of creativity in older age, which consists of the following six pathways: inspiration, adaptation, innovation, preservation, circumvention and imagination. While some of the interviewed directors emphasized their ability to change and adapt to the new cinematic world, others adhered to their old filmmaking language. The understanding of the cinematic creation as based upon the art of storytelling was common among both “camps”. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify, empirically analyze and validate the relationship between various social media marketing activities influencing the attitude of Indian consumers toward green products and their willingness to pay (WTP) a premium price for them. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from 536 respondents who not only use various social media channels for purchases and gaining information but also prefer and buy green products across India. Exploratory factor analysis was done for the refinement and validation of the questionnaire items, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationship among various variables. Findings: The findings of the empirical study confer consumer’s attitude toward green products being shaped by four main social media marketing activities, namely, word of mouth, interaction, entertainment and customization, whereas trendiness was found to be insignificant toward predicting consumer’s attitude. The positive attitude so formed has a significant and positive impact on the willingness of consumers to pay a premium price for green products. Originality/value: This research takes a lead in analyzing the construct WTP a premium for green products because this has been comparably less explored in Indian context. As spending a little extra by Indian consumers is a super sensitive issue, studying their willingness is therefore an important construct to be taken into account. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed at examining the extent of turnover intention among the Chinese resident physicians who entered the newly established national standardised residency training programme (SRTP), and exploring factors associated with their turnover intention. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Ten institutions from five geographical areas in China. Methods 1414 residents were surveyed using paper-based questionnaires and scales regarding their demographics, work situation, attitudes towards SRTP, job satisfaction, psychological resilience, burnout and turnover intention in 2017. The turnover intention was described and compared between categorical groups. Linear regressions were used to select the factors associated with turnover intention. The structural equation model was used to capture the potential mediating effects. Results The mean turnover intention score was 12.45 (SD=4.47). Nearly half (47.87%) of the residents had a high and very high level of turnover intention. Psychological resilience (β=0.066), burnout (β=0.141) and job satisfaction (β=0.022) were positively associated with turnover intention, while specialty (β=-0.135), year of training (β=-0.687), career in medicine (β=-2.191), necessity of training (β=-0.695) and satisfaction with income (β=-1.215) had negative associations with turnover intention. Working hours and nightshift interval indirectly were associated with turnover intention through the mediating effects of burnout. Career in medicine, necessity of training, satisfaction with income, and psychological resilience showed direct effects and indirect effects on turnover intention through burnout and job satisfaction as mediators. Conclusions The turnover intention among Chinese residents was prevalent and unignorable. Burnout was the major contributing factor, while year of training and positive attitudes towards training were protective factors. Burnout and job satisfaction also served as mediators. Interventions targeting these factors should be incorporated in the training programmes to keep a prosperous physician workforce. ©

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to significant changes in workplace practices as social distancing requirements meant that people were asked to work from home where possible to avoid unnecessary contact. Concerns have been raised about the effects of the pandemic on mental health and, in particular, the effects of social distancing on employed women's mental health. In this study, we explore the experiences of working women during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and explore the factors that may be associated with women experiencing the symptoms of depression. Findings from a cross-sectional survey of European working women (across five countries: France, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK) conducted between March and July 2020 are reported. The data are analyzed using linear regression and mediation analysis. For women, working from home was associated with higher prevalence of the symptoms of depression compared to traveling to a workplace. The study also considers the mechanisms that may explain a relationship between working from home and depressive symptoms. Maintaining contact with people face-to-face and participating in exercise were both significant protective factors against experiencing symptoms of depression during a period of social distancing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in closure of schools and playgrounds while requiring social distancing, changes that likely affected youth sports participation. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the epidemiology of pediatric sports injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients between the ages of 4 and 18 years who presented to orthopaedic clinics within a single children's hospital network with an acute injury sustained during athletic activity between March 20, 2020, and June 3, 2020 (the strictest period of state-level shelter-in-place orders). These patients were compared with those within the same dates in 2018 and 2019. Chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used, as appropriate. RESULTS: Significantly less sports injuries were seen during the pandemic (n = 257) compared with the same dates in 2018 (n = 483) and 2019 (n = 444) despite more providers available in 2020 (P < 0.001). During the pandemic, patients with sports injuries were younger (median age 11 versus 13 years, P < 0.001) and had less delay in presentation (median 5 versus 11 days, P < 0.001). A higher proportion were White (66.9% versus 47.7%, P < 0.001), privately insured (63.4% versus 48.3%, P < 0.001), and seen at a nonurban location (63.4% versus 50.2%, P < 0.001). Most sports injuries during the pandemic were fractures (83.7%). Although 71.4% of all injuries in the prepandemic period occurred in the context of formal sports, only 15.2% were sustained in a formal athletic context in 2020 (P < 0.001). The frequency of surgical treatment was higher during the pandemic (14.8% versus 7.8%, P = 0.001), mainly because most of these injuries were fractures requiring surgical intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer sports injuries were seen in the outpatient setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of these injuries were fractures and occurred outside of organized sports settings. Patients were more likely to be White, privately insured, and seen at a nonurban location. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objective To investigate the COVID-19 vaccination coverage rate and differences among various COVID-19 prevention primary healthcare (PHC) facilities in China and understand their attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccine. These findings are helpful to provide important suggestions to further improve national COVID-19 vaccination rate. Design A nationwide cross-sectional online survey was designed and conducted among COVID-19 prevention and control management teams at PHC facilities in mainland China. In the self-designed questionnaires, each subject was asked to evaluate on a 1-10 scale (10=extremely important/acceptable/influential) the COVID-19 vaccination importance, acceptance and factors related to vaccine hesitancy. Setting Subjects from 31 provinces and autonomous regions including minorities across mainland China were invited to complete the questionnaire between 22 February 2021 and 2 March 2021. Participants Were selected by multistage stratified sampling, 998 valid questionnaires (valid rate 99.11%) were collected. The respondents were divided into group A (≤5 respondents within each PHC facility, n 1 =718) and group B (>5 respondents within each PHC facility, n 2 =280). Outcome measures Survey on vaccination rate and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine included the following: (1) if the subjects think the vaccination is important in containment of COVID-19 pandemic (1-10 scale, 10=extremely important), (2) if they would accept COVID-19 vaccine (1-10 scale, 10=extremely acceptable) and (3) their opinions on 7 factors possibly related to vaccine hesitancy (1-10 scale, 10=extremely influential). All the items were designed based on the previous expert interviews. Results Our results showed vaccination rate was greater in group A (85.93%) than in group B (66.43%) (p<0.001). Detailed analyses revealed that in group A, male members were twice as likely to get vaccinated as compared with female members (adjusted OR (aOR): 2.07; 95% CI: 1.26 to 3.43, p=0.004). In group B, those who were at or under the median age had twice the odds of vaccination coverage compared with those who were over the median age (aOR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.22 to 4.33, p=0.010). In addition, those who were specialised in traditional Chinese medicine were less likely to get vaccinated against COVID-19 compared with those who were specialised in general medicine, with the aOR: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.83, p=0.033). By analysing the factors that influenced the vaccination attitudes among the 998 respondents, we found no significant difference between the vaccinated and unvaccinated participants. However, further detailed analyses found that team members with undergraduate college education were less likely to score higher in COVID-19 vaccination importance than those with technical secondary school education (aOR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.93, p=0.035); Furthermore, those with non-medical job titles had nearly twice the odds of giving a higher score for the uncertainty of vaccine efficacy compared with those with junior medical titles (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.016). Team members with a non-medical title were more likely to give a higher score for advice on social sources compared with those with a junior medical title (aOR: 1.70; 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.85, p=0.042). Conclusion In PHC facilities, although there was a higher COVID-19 vaccination rate among COVID-19 prevention and control teams, some subgroups with different descriptive characters showed negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Because primary care workers in China are highly expected to receive the vaccination, and support and educate the public for COVID-19 vaccination. Thus, it is important and necessary to continue to educate them about their vaccination concerns and change their attitudes towards vaccination. Our findings are highly beneficial for designing public vaccination education strategies. ©

AB  - Objective We examined the association between stay-at-home order implementation and the incidence of COVID-19 infections and deaths in rural versus urban counties of the United States. Design We used an interrupted time-series analysis using a mixed effects zero-inflated Poisson model with random intercept by county and standardised by population to examine the associations between stay-at-home orders and county-level counts of daily new COVID-19 cases and deaths in rural versus urban counties between 22 January 2020 and 10 June 2020. We secondarily examined the association between stay-at-home orders and mobility in rural versus urban counties using Google Community Mobility Reports. Interventions Issuance of stay-at-home orders. Primary and secondary outcome measures Co-primary outcomes were COVID-19 daily incidence of cases (14-day lagged) and mortality (26-day lagged). Secondary outcome was mobility. Results Stay-at-home orders were implemented later (median 30 March 2020 vs 28 March 2020) and were shorter in duration (median 35 vs 54 days) in rural compared with urban counties. Indoor mobility was, on average, 2.6%-6.9% higher in rural than urban counties both during and after stay-at-home orders. Compared with the baseline (pre-stay-at-home) period, the number of new COVID-19 cases increased under stay-at-home by incidence risk ratio (IRR) 1.60 (95% CI, 1.57 to 1.64) in rural and 1.36 (95% CI, 1.30 to 1.42) in urban counties, while the number of new COVID-19 deaths increased by IRR 14.21 (95% CI, 11.02 to 18.34) in rural and IRR 2.93 in urban counties (95% CI, 1.82 to 4.73). For each day under stay-at-home orders, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.981 to 0.982) in rural and 0.952 (95% CI, 0.951 to 0.953) in urban counties compared with prior to stay-at-home, while number of new deaths changed by a factor of 0.977 (95% CI, 0.976 to 0.977) in rural counties and 0.935 (95% CI, 0.933 to 0.936) in urban counties. Each day after stay-at-home orders expired, the number of new cases changed by a factor of 0.995 (95% CI, 0.994 to 0.995) in rural and 0.997 (95% CI, 0.995 to 0.999) in urban counties compared with prior to stay-at-home, while number of new deaths changed by a factor of 0.969 (95% CI, 0.968 to 0.970) in rural counties and 0.928 (95% CI, 0.926 to 0.929) in urban counties. Conclusion Stay-at-home orders decreased mobility, slowed the spread of COVID-19 and mitigated COVID-19 mortality, but did so less effectively in rural than in urban counties. This necessitates a critical re-evaluation of how stay-at-home orders are designed, communicated and implemented in rural areas. ©

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that young adults are more hesitant/resistant to COVID-19 vaccine uptake than older age groups, although the factors underlying this tendency are still under debate. The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young adults (18–40 years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and which suffered a large number of fatalities. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results: Vaccine hesitancy/resistance was found for 25% of the sample. In multinomial logistic regression (N = 1159), being aged 30–40 years, residing in northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In multivariate analysis of variance (N = 1177), both vaccine hesitant and resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant counterparts. Moreover, resistant individuals reported significantly lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just government compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults scoring in between. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that young adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety. Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in institutions amongst this particular segment of the population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Between January and April 2020, China implemented differentiated prevention and control strategies across the country, based on the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic in different regions. These strategies included lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of public places. These measures may have affected dietary intake to varying degrees. This study aimed to assess variations in food intake and diet quality among pregnant women according to regional severity and related control measures during the most severe period of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. Methods: A total of 3,678 pregnant women from 19 provinces/municipalities in mainland China were analyzed in this nationwide, multi-center study. Food intake data were obtained and assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Diet quality was quantified using the Diet Balance Index for Pregnancy (DBI-P), which included high bound score (HBS, excessive dietary intake), low bound score (LBS, insufficient dietary intake), and diet quality distance (DQD, dietary imbalance). Linear trend tests and multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the association between food intake, DBI-P and the severity of pandemic. Results: The median daily intake of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy, and nuts decreased (p < 0.05) according to low, moderate, and high severity of the pandemic, while no significant differences in cereals/potatoes, eggs, and fish/shrimp intake. The median daily intake of cereals/potatoes exceeded the recommended ranges, and the daily intake of eggs and fish/shrimp was below recommended ranges regardless of the pandemic severity (p < 0.05). Regarding diet quality, HBS decreased (lower excessive consumption) (p = 0.047) and LBS increased (greater insufficient consumption) (p = 0.046) with increased severity of the pandemic. On multivariable analyses, moderate and high pandemic severity were related to lower HBS risk (OR = 0.687, OR = 0.537) and higher LBS risk (β = 1.517, β = 3.020) when compared to low pandemic severity. Conclusions: Under more severe COVID-19 pandemic conditions, pregnant women consumed less quality food, characterized by reduced consumption of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy and nuts, while the quality of the foods that pregnant women consumed in excess tended to improve, but the overconsumption of cereals/potatoes was a problem.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to perform a systematic review of the dialectics and telematics strategy for regulating religion during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also analyzes some important issues related to religions, state, and society. Design/methodology/approach: A critical literature review was performed to complete this study, using media, institutional, national, and international reports, as well as recent and previous studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: Religion was one of the social entities that had a crucial effect on the COVID-19 pandemic. The new system in the form of social distancing affects its performance. Furthermore, the response of religion in Indonesia is unique when its status is considered as the largest Islamic country in the world. Therefore, this study attempts to analyze and demonstrate the dynamics of relationships between actors, religion, and state in the process and strategy of religious regulation. Research limitations/implications: This study was carried out using a single methodological approach. Practical implications: This study provides input to both religion and the state (government) in building a synergy of constructive responses to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social implications: It provides input to society in understanding the critical intersection between religion, state, and society. Originality/value: This may be the first academic study that analyzes the problems of the process of regulating religion in the context of COVID-19. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Aim: The study sought to assess the impact or lived experiences of COVID-19 pandemic on older adults in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in a Teaching Hospital in Ghana. Methods: The study employed an explorative qualitative research design where older adults were purposively identified and recruited to partake in in-depth interviews from April to June 2021. They were located in the hospital environment where they came for review or physician attention. 10 out of 20 of these population were successfully used as saturation was reached and data was analyzed thematically. Result: The results of the study showed that a considerable number of older adults who receive care from the Hospital were knowledgeable of COVID-19 and demonstrated a positive attitude towards it by being sensitive to the appropriate preventive measures. Almost all the participants had heard of COVID-19, knew what it was, its mode of transmission and knew of the fact that asymptomatic persons could spread or transmit the disease and its prevention. They also believed that following proper handwashing with soap under running water, maintaining social distance, wearing of nose masks, using of hand sanitizers, avoiding crowded places, and consuming balanced diets as well as Vitamin C to boost the immune system are helpful. And, most of them received help from their partners, family, children, friends, healthcare professionals, and the media. Conclusion: COVID 19 has brought a new dimension to how people relate and interact with each other. Literature documents that older adults were at risk of the disease and fatality rate of the disease was high. This created anxiety and it was evident that this anxiety was handled differently. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Unlike the biomedical account of illness, cultural/social/literary models investigate the central role of culture in mediating the lived experiences of the sufferers. As such, the meaning of illness is not shaped by biomedical factors alone, cultural artefacts also determine the social meanings of illness and suffering. Put differently, popular cultural media such as films, novels, television, and advertisements among others collectively generate and shape public attitudes toward illness. However, popular cultural media very often promote the prevailing stereotypes and normative concepts of illness and thus negatively contribute to the understanding of illness conditions. Along these lines, existing cultural and literary discourses on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) trivialize dementia and dehumanize the sufferers of dementia as zombies, empty shells, and non-persons. Taking these cues, the present paper close reads popular representations of dementia in movies, newspapers, novels, and comics in order to demonstrate how such representations of ADRD reinforce dominant stereotypes and even sustain them. Furthermore, the paper also investigates the negative implications of such representations in the context of illness and ADRD on personal and social lives. © 2022 Aesthetics Media Services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pre and post-vaccination effects of vaccination on various COVID SOPs and to determine whether or not HCWs take adequate precautions. METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May and July 2021. Online survey forms were distributed via social media platforms, completed by male and female house officers, medical officers, postgraduate trainees, residents, and specialists/consultants at Holy Family Hospital in Rawalpindi. RESULTS: Our study enrolled 104 volunteers. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 30 years, and males constituted more than half of the study population. The most frequently used designation was postgraduate trainees/residents, which accounted for 34% of all participants. 100% of medical professionals used masks before vaccination, and 45% of medical professionals practiced social distancing. Fourteen of the participants discontinued the use of masks following vaccination. Hand washing and sanitizing habits decreased by 14. CONCLUSION: Vaccination has made life easy for HCWs, as negative trends are observed towards preventive measures. The pandemic timeline and physical and mental well-being depreciation also played a crucial role in the COVID-19 SOPs. So let us all hope that the whole population gets vaccinated and the virus gets eradicated. © 2022 Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Political polarization has dominated news coverage of Americans’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research note, we report findings from two experimental studies, in which we present respondents with news stories about COVID-19 mitigation measures that emphasize partisan difference or accord. The stories present the same numeric facts about public opinion, but highlight either the partisan gap that existed at the time of the study, or the fact that large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats supported the measures at the time. Results from our first study, conducted late April 2020, show that a media frame drawing attention to shared concern across party lines produced a less polarized response to social-distancing restrictions than a frame that drew attention to partisan difference. Our findings suggest that the extensive media coverage about the red-blue divide in COVID-19 opinions reinforced partisan polarization. These results, however, did not replicate in a second study conducted much later in the pandemic. Qualitative data collected across the two studies demonstrate the degree to which polarization had rapidly become a dominant narrative in Americans’ thinking about COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate with the emergence of new variants. Variant B.1.617.2 (Delta) is a variant of concern with evidence of increased transmission, more severe disease, decreased effectiveness of treatment or vaccines, or failure of diagnostic detection. In this article, we report on the clinical and biological picture of the first confirmed delta variant COVID-19 infection in Indonesia. From May 31 to June 17, we identified ten cases with confirmed delta variant COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic hospital in Jakarta. All subjects that have been vaccinated presented with mild-moderate disease. Most patients present with initial respiratory complaints, without radiological abnormalities on chest x-ray examination, and an increase in C-reactive protein. Seven out of ten patients have been vaccinated; the three patients who had not been vaccinated experienced severe COVID-19 symptoms, two of whom died. Due to the increased transmission of this variant, we recommend vaccination, wearing a mask, and social distancing to reduce the impact of infection with delta variant B.1,617.2.

AB  - Background: The acceptance and availability of effective vaccines are crucial for the success of vaccination programs. Medical doctors and students are the epitome of shaping the public interest in vaccines. Aim: To evaluate the general public's attitudes, including dental students and health care professionals, at the national level towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students' acceptance levels. Methods: A national-level cross-sectional study was carried out in May-June 2021 using an online questionnaire. The sample was categorized based on age, gender, academic level, and location. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of the COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. Results: The number of people who answered the questionnaire was 1271. The males accounted for 38.9%, and females were 61.1%. The age group, 18-45 years with 14.7%, has the highest percentage of people who have not taken vaccination. In context to gender, 13.5% of males and 13.1% of females have not taken vaccination. The percentage of vaccination hesitancy is highest in rural areas with 19.5%. The health care professionals were vaccinated with the highest percentage of 89.8%. Conclusion: The vaccination acceptance level of the population for COVID-19 vaccines was good, approximately 63%, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy 27% was governed by demographic, social, and economic factors. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were major hurdles to vaccination. © 2022 Journal of Indian Academy of Oral Medicine & Radiology.

AB  - The large number of refugees and host countries’ citizens’ reactions regarding their admission have been major global issues. Thus, psychological interventions to foster intergroup relations in the asylum context are desirable. In three experiments with general population samples (N = 986), we adapted a paradoxical thinking intervention to the intergroup context of Germans and refugees, thus testing its effectiveness in an early stage of conflict. Participants in the paradoxical condition, compared to two control conditions, showed lower levels of conflict-related concerns (Experiment 1), higher levels of openness to alternative information (Experiment 1, 3) and higher willingness to compromise (Experiment 2). In addition, the intervention was still successful when the sender of the paradoxical questions belonged to a political outgroup (Experiment 3). A mini-meta-analysis corroborated significant effects across experiments (for openness and willingness to compromise). Ideas for future research and the intervention's practical use are discussed (e.g., in social media). © 2022 The Authors. European Journal of Social Psychology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To determine the reasons for hesitancy regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Combined Military Hospital, Rawalpindi Pakistan, from Feb to Jun 2021. Methodology: After Ethical Committee approval, 100 respondents were recruited, regardless of vaccination status, and requested to respond to 27 different myths and queries circulating about COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Mean age of participants was 36.25 ± 5.77 years, ranging from 15-80 years. Fifty-three were males and 47 females. 41% of subjects trusted the Sino-pharm vaccine, and 25% preferred Pfizer Bio N Tech, while 34% could not answer due to the lack of knowledge. 55% subjects showed concern about catching the infection from Vaccination. 54% considered vaccines unsafe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. 29% believed it unsafe for the elderly and those with comorbidities. 14% believed it could cause autism in children and infertility in adults. 62% individuals acknowledged that vaccines have no nano chips to track patients. 46% opined that vaccines were rushed through trials and had doubtful efficacy. 11% individuals thought vaccines could alter DNA, while most were aware of this false concept. 28% considered that vaccines were needless because recovery from COVID-19 was excellent, while 63% emphasised the need for Vaccination. 23% deemed the side effects of vaccines more dangerous than the disease itself. 85% individuals favoured use of mask and social distancing after getting the vaccine. Conclusion: Strong efforts are needed to support the COVID-19 vaccine and to eliminate negative propaganda on media outlets. © 2022, Army Medical College. All rights reserved.

Initial findings suggest that physical distancing in particular can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Objectives: To investigate how information to prevent the spread of infectious diseases should be presented to increase willingness to comply with preventive measures. Methods: In a preregistered online experiment, 817 subjects were presented with either interactively controllable graphics on the spread of COVID-19 and information that enable them to recognize how much the spread of COVID-19 is reduced by physical distancing (experimental group) or text-based information about quantitative evidence (control group). It was hypothesized that participants receiving interactive information on the prevention of COVID-19 infections show a significantly higher willingness to comply with future containment measures than participants reading the text-based information. Explorative analyses were conducted to examine whether other factors influence compliance. Results: As predicted, we found a small effect (d = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11; 0.23, p < .001) for the tested intervention. The exploratory analysis suggests a decline in compliance later in the study (r = −0.10, 95% CI: −0.15; −0.07). Another significant predictor of change in compliance was health-related anxiety, but the effect was trivial. Conclusions: When presented interactively, information on how the own behavior can help prevent infectious diseases can lead to slightly stronger changes in attitude towards behavioral prevention measures than just text-based information. Given the scalability of this simple internet-based intervention, it could play a role in fostering compliance during a pandemic within universal prevention strategies. Future work on the predictive validity of self-reported compliance and the real-world effects on the intervention is needed. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Introduction: Globally, tuberculosis still remains a disease of public health concern and accounts for high morbidity and mortality particularly in developing countries, where it is fuelled by a number of factors. Methodology: Through a cross-sectional descriptive study, this study aims to determine the predictors of knowledge about TB among 261 mothers of children under 5 years of age attending Child Welfare Clinic, Bingham University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Results: The mean age of the mothers was 31.54 ± 5.28 years, and 249 (98.4%) aware of TB. About two-third having sufficient knowledge and positive attitude regarding TB. Significant statistical association was found between knowledge and attainment of post-secondary education (OR 4.0; 95% CI 12.09, 7.63; p < 0.001), monthly income ≤ 25,000 naira (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.02, 4.65; p = 0.042), monthly income > 51,000 naira (OR 3.24; 95% CI 1.43, 7.31; p = 0.005), women engaged in business (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.22, 0.83; p = 0.012) and possessing positive attitude (OR 3.87; 95% CI 2.16, 6.93; p < 0.001) in the univariate analysis. However, in the multivariate logistic regression, it was only attitude that was found to be a predictor of TB knowledge of mothers. Conclusions: TB knowledge among the mothers was high, only attitude regarding thoughts and beliefs about TB was found as an independent predictor of TB knowledge. With the positive influence of attitude on knowledge among the mothers, it is recommended that this be strengthened for sustenance to prevent further infection. Copyright © 2022 Asuke et al.

AB  - Introduction: Infection is a key challenge in healthcare settings around the world. Healthcare professionals (HCPs), including medical laboratory technologists (MLTs) and nurses, are at risk of infection because they are in close contact with infected patients. This investigation was conducted to evaluate the awareness, attitude, and practices of Infection Prevention Control (IPC) among HCPs working in private tertiary hospitals in two states in South India. Methodology: This quantitative study surveyed 571 HCPs in southern India. In September 2021, an online survey was used to collect data on the respondents’ demographic and IPC-related variables, as well as their awareness, attitudes, and practices of IPC. Results: The survey revealed high level of awareness, positive attitudes, and good IPC practices. Among the IPC practices, “changing gloves between contacts with different patients” was the most often practiced and “washing hands after removal of gloves” was the least practiced. Being a nurse, being older, finishing a graduate program, attending a risk assessment training, having sufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) at work, and being aware of the safety guidelines were associated with better awareness. Being a nurse, being older, and holding a diploma were associated with more positive attitudes. Being MLT, attending risk assessment training, having sufficient PPE at work, and being aware of the safety guidelines were associated with better IPC practices. Conclusions: Measures to sustain the high awareness, positive attitudes, and good IPC practices by dealing with the factors associated with these variables identified in this study must be planned and implemented.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has posed critical and unprecedented challenges to the well-being of people across the globe, threatening human health, social stability and economic prospects. The crisis has mobilized stakeholders from different departments to empower citizens and help them understand the situation, restore control, minimize risks and enhance resilience. As a result, all parties such as healthcare providers, policy-makers, public authorities and NGOs have been struggling to develop effective messaging and communication approaches in order to provide the public with information about what they can do and how they can help themselves. Communication is a vital arm when a crisis hits; it helps the audience perceive and respond to risk messages in a rational and critical way. This article examines the role of crisis communication (CC) amid coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Morocco. It aims at understanding citizens’ different perceptions and opinions about the communication approach incorporated during the crisis. A survey questionnaire was conducted with a total sample of 250 participants. The questionnaire was used to investigate the extent to which communication has helped citizens understand the crisis situation and effectively respond to its challenges. The findings highlight that Moroccans hold positive attitudes towards the communication approach adopted during the COVID-19 emergency; they acknowledge the importance and efficiency of the communicated information in shaping public perception of risk and enhancing resilience, prevention and mitigation. Thus, this article proves the assumption that CC, using different platforms and resources, can play a life-saving role in increasing understanding and enhancing risk control and disease management. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - This qualitative textual analysis used framing theory to compare 80 online arti-cles from Cable News Network (CNN) and British Broadcasting Company (BBC) dealing with the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand. The study examined themes of Islamophobia and White supremacy and the media representation of the White perpetrator who carried out the attack. The analysis over eight days following the shooting identified the most prominent frames used by both network, and how these frames were employed to serve a specific context. The study found that the attack was too shocking to the extent that BBC and CNN adopted a new non-classical narrative that was not typical of western news coverage of attacks committed by White perpetrators. This shift was represented by adopting frames of ‘terrorist’ and ‘terrorism’ and avoiding the frame of ‘mentally sick perpetrator’ that used to be prevalent in western media coverage of similar attacks. Both networks associated the perpetrator with White supremacy and engaging in a terrorist attack. While both CNN and BBC framed the shooting as a terrorist attack driven by Islamophobic sentiments, the terrorism framing was more obvious on CNN than on the BBC. The White supremacist motive was high-lighted by CNN, while the right-wing framing was central in the BBC coverage. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.

AB  - Effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent on individual understanding of the disease and compliance to prevention measures. Early media depiction of health information about COVID-19 may influence public perceptions and behaviour. Media should ensure coverage is relevant, timely and actionable to encourage individuals to respond appropriately. India has been particularly affected by a large COVID-19 caseload. We analysed online reporting in India to assess how well the media represented health information about COVID-19 as per the World Health Organization's Strategic Risk Communications guidelines. This included media coverage of symptoms, transmission and prevention. We found that limited articles (18.8%) provided actionable suggestions to readers, including urging people to stay at home and social distance. Most articles were relevant as per WHO COVID-19 updates, accurately covering symptoms, risk factors for severe symptoms, transmission and prevention. However, 40% of media coverage of treatments options provided misleading information, such as suggesting plasma therapy or chloroquine, were effective. In addition, only 1.9% of articles included discussion of equity issues, where many prevention activities such as distancing are less applicable in lower-income households. Sixty-seven per cent of articles quoting sources of information quoted credible sources such as public health agencies and researchers. Media coverage also did not appear to reflect WHO updates in a timely manner, with most of the coverage preceding these updates. The findings show that Indian media should focus on actionable and relevant reporting that provides guidance for individual response. Media should also endeavour to report on evidence-based prevention and treatment options to avert the spread of misinformation. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - During presidential elections and showbusiness or social news events, society has begun to address the risk of fake news. The Sustainable Development Goals 4 for Global Education Agenda aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. As a result, various nations have deemed media literacy education a required competence in order for audiences to maintain a discerning attitude and to verify messages rather than automatically believing them. This study developed a highly efficient message discrimination method using new technology using artificial intelligence and big data information processing containing general news and content farm message data on approximately 938,000 articles. Deep neural network technology was used to create a news source credibility identification system. Media literacy was the core of the experimental course design. Two groups of participants used different methods to perform message discrimination. The results revealed that the system significantly expanded the participants’ knowledge of media literacy. The system positively affected the participants’ attitude, confidence, and motivation towards media literacy learning. This research provides a method of identifying fake news in order to ensure that audiences are not affected by fake messages, thereby helping to maintain a democratic society. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Sustaining youths interest in entrepreneurial education is important to cultivating future entrepreneurs. This study examines factors influencing entrepreneurial attitudes among youth using 334 respondents within the context of Indonesian institutes of higher learning. The findings show that in entrepreneurial education, both perceived educator competency and perceived social support are important drivers for the creation of self-efficacy in youth. However, only perceived social support is directly related to increased entrepreneurial attitude orientation. On the other hand, when selfefficacy is introduced as a mediating variable, both perceived educator competency and perceived social support show influence on youths entrepreneurial attitude orientation. From these findings, the research proposed both its theoretical and managerial implications. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Social interaction during adolescence strongly influences brain function and behavior, and the recent pandemic has emphasized the devastating effect of social distancing on mental health. While accumulating evidence has shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in male mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioral changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of putative dopamine (pDA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto pDA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioral deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation in male mice has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that homeostatic adaptations mediate these effects within the reward circuit. © 2022, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd.

AB  - Support for lesbian and gay (LG) civil rights has increased in recent decades, but heterosexism is still prevalent, particularly among highly religious populations. Evidence suggests, however, that it may not be affiliation, but rather conviction in one’s beliefs that relates to prejudicial attitudes. The aims of this study were to examine the relationships among religiosity, heterosexism, and level of support for LG civil rights, as well as potential moderating effects by religious fundamentalism. This study used Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (Mturk) to recruit a U.S. national sample (n = 407) to participate in an online survey. A mediation model was constructed with religiosity leading to heterosexism, which diminished support for LG civil rights. This mediation model was expanded into moderated mediations with three types of religious fundamentalism as moderators. Heterosexism fully mediated the relationship between religiosity and support for LG civil rights. A moderated mediation was observed for aspects of religious fundamentalism reflecting external authority and worldly rejection (but not fixed religion) such that the mediation was present only when participants had high levels of these types of religious fundamentalism. Despite the belief that religious people endorse higher levels of heterosexism and that this influences their support for LG civil rights, this is only true when religiosity is also coupled with fundamentalist belief systems reflecting external authority and worldly rejection. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly communicable virus that continues to interrupt livelihoods, predominantly those of low-income segments of society. For the prevention of respiratory infections like the current COVID-19 outbreak, face masks are considered an effective approach. Objective. This study intended to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of public transport drivers towards face mask use amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Gondar, Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 public transport drivers in Gondar town from July to September 2021. The study subjects were recruited using a simple random sampling technique after proportionally allocating the sample size from the total number of public transport drivers, and finally, study subjects were selected using the convenience sampling method to select the participant drivers working in Gondar Town. The data were collected by face-to-face interview administered questioners and an on-the-spot observational checklist. Results. A total of 412 public transport drivers have participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 32.75 years (±8.75 years). The majority of the participants were Bajaj drivers 193 (46.84%). Among the responders, 114 (27.67%) of them use radio to gather information about the pandemic and 50 (12.14%) of them had reported being caught by COVID-19. Meanwhile, only 32 (7.77%) were vaccinated against COVID-19. Drivers that had a diploma level of education were found to be 87.7% less knowledgeable than degree holders (AOR.123, 95% CI =.026,.573). Respondents that had good knowledge about COVID-19 and face masks were found to have 1.7 times more positive attitudes than those that had poor knowledge (AOR = 1.728, 95% CI = 1.150, 2.596). drivers whose family members have ever been caught by COVID-19 were found 2 times more likely to use face masks whenever they are working/driving (AOR = 2.173, 95% CI = 1.015, 4.652) than their counterparts. Conclusion. This study revealed a very low Knowledge, attitude, and practice of face mask use among public transport drivers in Gondar town. Periodic reinforcement and training programs are needed for all public transport drivers in each level for proper understanding and adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols and the use of face masks. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Nightlife is a controversial offer for its possible negative social impacts, but it is also important for its media impact and as an element of differentiation of the tourist destination. In the coastal resorts it is a very important offer as it complements the main offer. This paper seeks to determine the background of residents’ attitudes towards the offer of nightlife. To do this, the responses of a sample of 420 residents of the Maldonado-Punta del Este conurbation (Uruguay) who responded to a questionnaire with items measured with Likert scales are analyzed using Structural Equation Models. A first analysis, which presents costs and benefits of three types (economic, social and cultural) as a possible background of the degree of acceptance of this offer, did not detect significant relationships. In a second analysis, the mediation of the overall attitude towards tourism and the degree of acceptance of sun and beach tourism were proposed. In this second analysis it was found that: only economic benefits and cultural costs have significant effects on the overall attitude; the overall attitude has a significant effect on the acceptance of sun and beach tourism, but not on the acceptance of nightlife; and the acceptance of sun and beach tourism has a significant effect on the acceptance of nightlife. The acceptance of nightlife follows the same guidelines as its business development (it is a consequence of sun and beach tourism). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This empirical paper aims at measuring customer attitudes concerning Islamic banking services and how they influence their behavioural intentions to utilise them. Islamic banking has been a fast-growing sector, offering products and services according to Sharia law. Despite being the preferred choice of banking, there is a high percentage of Muslim customers who have shifted from conventional to Islamic banking. Hence, this study aims to examine factors that influence them towards the use of Islamic banking. This is cross-sectional research, where data were collected using questionnaires. A total of 490 questionnaires were received back from adult individuals who were clients of Islamic banks. The data were analyzed using the partial least squares (PLS) method. The findings indicate that ethical organisation, Islamic values, and reputation significantly impact attitudes, whereas financial literacy has no significant impact on them. Attitude is strongly related to the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services. The results also reveal that attitudes mediate the effect of Islamic values, ethical organisation, and reputation on the behavioural intention to engage in Islamic banking services, but Islamic financial literacy is not associated with customers’ behavioural mindset to enjoy such services. This study provides an example of initial empirical evidence from a Muslim majority country like Bangladesh on the relationship between Islamic values, ethical organization, Islamic financial literacy, and reputation and attitudes, which in turn lead to customers’ behavioural intentions to engage in services and products of Islamic banks. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - At present, the polarization of online public opinion is becoming more frequent, and individuals actively participate in attitude interactions more and more frequently. Thus, online views have become the dominant force in current public opinion. However, the rapid fermentation of polar-ized public opinion makes it very easy for actual topic views to go to extremes. Significantly, negative information seriously affects the healthy development of the social opinion ecology. Therefore, it is beneficial to maintain national credibility, social peace, and stability by exploring the communication structure of online public opinions, analyzing the logical model of extreme public attitudes, and guiding the communication of public opinions in a timely and reasonable manner. Starting from the J–A model and BA network, this paper explores the specific attributes of individuals and opinion network nodes. By incorporating parameters such as individual conformity and the strength of individual online relationships, we established a model of online group attitude polarization, then conducted simulation experiments on the phenomenon of online opinion polarization. Through simulations, we found that individual conformity and the difference in environmental attitude greatly influence the direction of opinion polarization events. In addition, crowd mentality makes individuals spontaneously choose the side of a particular, extreme view, which makes it easier for polarization to form and reach its peak. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) screening aims to detect PC in early stages, amenable to curative treatment and reduction in disease morbidity and mortality. However, PC screening may be associated with overdiagnosis and complications of unnecessary treatment for indolent disease. Therefore, careful patient selection for PC screening is critical to avoid overestimation and missed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess physicians’ knowledge and attitude towards early detection of PC in Jordan and whether their knowledge is an important predictor of their attitude. An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, knowledge, and attitude of physicians regarding early detection of PC. The participants’ responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. Around 296 physicians agreed to participate in this study. Most respondents were males (75.7%), residents (34%), practiced medicine more than 15 years (29%) and graduated (81.4%) from local universities. Surprisingly, only 28.4% recognized PC as a non-self-detected disease and less than one-half (48.6%) were aware that PC screening tests are not enough to exclude a diagnosis of PC. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 59%. Around two-thirds of participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of PC (median attitude POMP score was 66%). Higher attitude scores were significantly associated with younger age, those working in private hospitals, and those having higher knowledge POMP score (P <.05). This study highlighted that most physicians demonstrated a positive attitude towards PC screening but with moderate level of knowledge that is considered an important predictor of their attitude towards PC early detection. Thus, improving knowledge and awareness of physicians should be considered as a strategy to improve their attitude towards prostate screening practices and informing men of the importance of regular screening. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Were policy responses of the US states to the pandemic driven by partisan politics or by budgetary reasons? We show that balanced-budget rules also had an impact, mediated by the possibility of benefiting from the funds previously stored in budget stabilisation funds. State policymakers tried to square the circle by simultaneously respecting budget rules, limiting the economic impact of the social distancing measures, combating the pandemic and pandering to their political bases. Some fiscal rules have induced a trade-off between health and public finance, which may reignite the debate on the pro-cyclicality of fiscal rules. © AESP 2022.

AB  - The term political extremism is commonly used to refer to political attitudes considered to be outside the ideological mainstream. This study leverages computational content analysis of big data to longitudinally examine (1970–2019) the prevalence of terms denoting far-right and far-left political extremism in more than 30 million written news and opinion articles from 54 news media outlets popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. We find that the usage of terms denoting right and left political extremism has been increasing across news media outlets in both countries. This trend is particularly stark for far-right-denoting terms, which have been growing in prevalence since at least 2008. Most U.S. and U.K. news media outlets tend to use far-right-denoting terms substantially more often than they use far-left-denoting terms. The rising prevalence in news media of terms denoting political extremism is strongly correlated with similar growing usage of terms denoting prejudice and social justice discourse. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper explores whether consumers’ perceptions of environmental, social and governance initiatives can impact on attitude, and how three brand-related constructs—brand credibility, brand image and perceived quality—mediate this relationship. An online survey was conducted with 458 South Korean consumers, and the data were investigated through a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The empirical results indicated direct positive effects of social and governance dimensions of perceived ESG on brand credibility, brand image, and perceived quality. However, no direct impact of the environmental dimension of perceived ESG on brand-related constructs was identified. Further, the results confirmed that brand credibility, brand image and perceived quality partially mediate the relationship between perceived ESG and attitude. Based on the findings, this paper suggests implications and future research directions. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Increasing diversity and the anticipation of its resulting cultural change is raising vociferous protestations among White Americans. Here, we explore moderation and mediation of its intergroup implications. Among a nationally representative sample of White Americans, Study 1 (n = 2,257) revealed that living in a region that experienced a greater (vs. lesser) increase in racial diversity in recent years was associated with more anti-immigrant attitudes, but only among those who were highly White-identified. In an experiment, Study 2 (n = 420, White Americans) revealed that collective nostalgia (i.e., longing for the ingroup’s past) mediated the relation between anticipated cultural change resulting from shifting demographics and anti-immigrant attitudes, but only for those who were highly White-identified. Thus, anti-immigrant sentiment among White Americans in response to changing demographics and culture is seen primarily among those personally invested in their White racial identity, an effect partly explained by a longing for bygone days. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, most elective surgeries were postponed, including cataract surgery. However, patients with severe and disabling visual impairment may have required urgent correction. Objective: To report the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel working with the patients requiring cataract surgery, under a pre-operative screening protocol. Materials and Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted in the Suddhavej Hospital, Mahasarakham University, Mahasarakham, Thailand during the early unlocked phase in May 2020. The local pre-operative screening protocol used during the period included questionnaires and pre-operative nucleic acid testing to screen for COVID-19 infection among patients. A combination of serial single nucleic acid test and SARSCoV-2 IgG antibody testing were used to screen SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel. Mask wearing and physical distancing were required during hospitalization. Results: One hundred fifty-eight patients underwent cataract surgery under local anesthesia. Thirty-three healthcare personnel were included. All tests for SARS-CoV-2 were negative for both patients and healthcare personnel. The incidence rate of COVID-19 infection among healthcare personnel was 0 (95% CI 0.000 to 0.003) per 100 person-hours. There were no reported symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during the observed period and follow-up. Conclusion: Due to a very low incidence rate of hospital-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare personnel, elective cataract surgery under local anesthesia could be continued during COVID-19 pandemic with strict adherence to screening protocol and other preventive measures. SARS-CoV-2 screening method by questionnaire alone may be feasible in a low COVID-19 incidence rate. © 2022 JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND

AB  - In this study, value-belief-norm (VBN) theory and the social exchange theory (SET) were applied to predict hotel customers’ pro-environmental responsibility behavior intention (PRBI) for the characteristics of NBSs in green hotels—specifically, to investigate the relationship between NBSs as green hotel and PRBI, and to test its mediating effect on pro-environmental perceived (PPV), pro-environmental perceived belief (PPVBE), personal pro-environmental norms (PPN), attitude toward environmental behavior (ATEB), mental health (MH), well-being (WB), and satisfaction (SA) and the moderating effect of locations (urban, rural) among these variables toward pro-environmental responsibility behavior intention (PRBI). Data were collected using a survey of 440 customers who had visited green hotels in the Republic of Korea within the last 12 months. We used to test the research hypotheses by structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings generally supported the hypothesized associations between variables within our proposed theoretical framework and confirmed the moderating effect of location. The study’s results have important theoretical and practical implications for the environment. We investigated the relationship between the characteristics of NBSs and PRBI of green hotels, and we investigated the relationship between psychological state, attitude, and behavior of green hotel customers by applying variables suitable for ART, SET, and VBN. In addition, we verified the moderating effect of customers’ green behavior and attitudes toward green hotels located in urban and rural areas. Moreover, these findings herein may encourage green hotels to participate in preventing environmental problems. It provides primary data on customers’ perception of ecofriendliness in establishing corporate management strategies. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The influx of refugees to Europe is a topic that dominates the political and media agenda. Furthermore, the installation of asylum-seeker centres (ASCs) has made asylum seekers and refugees highly visible in the everyday life of many European citizens. Drawing on theories of ethnic threat and intergroup contact, we examine how geospatial proximity to ASCs translates into threat or contact in an everyday context and how this affects attitudes toward asylum seekers. By taking advantage of a natural experiment, where the ASCs are assigned to city districts as-if at random, as well as innovating measures of outgroup exposure and geospatial proximity, we find that, although higher numbers of asylum seekers in one's own neighbourhood are related to an increased perception of their local presence, the actual presence of asylum seekers does not lead to more negative attitudes or a greater threat perception, nor to more frequent contact. It is only when the number of asylum seekers in one's own direct neighbourhood suddenly increases that attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorate. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines Kamila Shamsie's adaptation of Sophocles' Antigone in Home Fire (2017), a novel focused on Muslim identity, Islamophobia, and citizenship rights in contemporary Britain. It demonstrates that this novel is a multimedia work full of theatrical traces: A literary archive that preserves the dramatic quality of Sophocles' play but also encompasses multiple other forms of media and performance, from theatre and television to social media. The article focuses not so much on how Shamsie has adapted the plot of Antigone but on her reworking of tragedy's formal features or structures, such as dialogue, the chorus, and the messenger speech. In this polyphonic novel, such multimedia theatricality facilitates something that Greek tragedy itself produces: A contestation of multiple voices for audiences to hear, critique, and put against their own. Shamsie's manipulation of tragic form thus contributes to Home Fire's political import. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on families’ daily routines and psychosocial well-being, and technology has played a key role in providing socially distanced health care services. Objective: The first objective of this paper was to describe the content and delivery of a single-session, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention, which has been developed to help parents cope with children’s anxiety and manage daily situations with their children. The second objective was to report user adherence and satisfaction among the first participants who completed the intervention. Methods: The Let’s Cope Together intervention has been developed by our research group. It combines evidence-based CBT elements, such as psychoeducation and skills to manage anxiety, with parent training programs that strengthen how parents interact with their child and handle daily situations. A pre-post design was used to examine user satisfaction and the skills the parents learned. Participants were recruited using advertisements, media activity, day care centers, and schools and asked about background characteristics, emotional symptoms, and parenting practices before they underwent the iCBT. After they completed the 7 themes, they were asked what new parenting skills they had learned from the iCBT and how satisfied they were with the program. Results: Of the 602 participants who filled in the baseline survey, 196 (32.6%) completed the program’s 7 themes, and 189 (31.4%) completed the postintervention survey. Most (138/189, 73.0%) of the participants who completed the postintervention survey were satisfied with the program and had learned skills that eased both their anxiety (141/189, 74.6%) and their children’s anxiety (157/189, 83.1%). The majority (157/189, 83.1%) reported that they learned how to organize their daily routines better, and just over one-half (100/189, 53.0%) reported that the program improved how they planned each day with their children. Conclusions: The single-session iCBT helped parents to face the psychological demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should determine how the participation rate and adherence can be optimized in digital, universal interventions. This will help to determine what kinds of programs should be developed, including their content and delivery. © Tarja Korpilahti-Leino, Terhi Luntamo, Terja Ristkari, Susanna Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki, Laura Pulkki-Råback, Otto Waris, Hanna-Maria Matinolli, Atte Sinokki, Yuko Mori, Mami Fukaya, Yuko Yamada, Andre Sourander.

AB  - High rates of mental health problems are a growing concern in Czech higher education, negatively impacting students’ performance and wellbeing. Despite the serious nature of poor mental health, students often do not seek help because of negative attitudes and shame over mental health problems. Recent mental health research reports self-compassion is strongly associated with better mental health and reduced shame. However, relationships between those constructs remain to be evaluated among Czech students. This study aims to appraise the relationships between mental health problems, negative mental health attitudes, mental health shame, and self-compassion in this population. An opportunity sample of 119 psychology students from a Czech university completed questionnaires regarding these constructs. Correlation, regression, and path analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively associated with negative mental health attitudes and shame, and negatively associated with self-compassion. Self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems, while negative attitudes and shame did not. Last, self-compassion fully mediated the negative attitudes-mental health problems relationship, and partially mediated the shame-mental health problems relationship. Findings suggest self-compassion is essential for mental health in Czech students and associated with negative mental health attitudes and mental health shame. Czech universities can benefit from incorporating self-compassion training into their curricula to protect students’ mental health. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Digital technologies play a vital role in daily human life and significantly influence human attitudes toward the adoption of new and attractive lifestyles. The internet has been widely accepted in every modern society, and the act of purchasing products or services over the internet, known as online/internet shopping, has revolutionized business. This study was designed using the technology acceptance model and theory of reasoned action. This study identified important factors such as perceived awareness of security, perceived usefulness, personal innovativeness, and perceived ease of use in purchasing, together with the effects of these factors on online purchasing intentions and the mediating role of consumer attitudes toward online purchasing. The results show that the identified factors are positively and significantly related to consumer intentions and attitudes toward online purchasing. This study has the potential to guide online retailers and managers in expanding online purchasing platforms and in increasing their responsiveness to the need to restructure business models according to new technological developments. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Intergroup bias is a ubiquitous socio-cognitive phenomenon that, while sustaining human dependence on group living, often leads to prejudice, inequity, and violence; yet, its neural underpinnings remain unclear. Framed within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and targeting youth, this study utilized magnetoencephalography to describe intrinsic neural oscillatory processes that represent the intergroup bias and may link with engagement in peacemaking in order to shed further light on the neural mechanisms underpinning intergroup conflict. Across the oscillatory spectrum, from very low to very high frequency bands, the only rhythm found to underlie the intergroup bias was the alpha rhythm. Alpha rhythm was continuously activated across the task and integrated a rapid perceptual component in the occipital cortex with a top-down cognitive-control component in the medial cingulate cortex. These components were distinctly associated with the real-life intergroup dialogue style and expressed attitudes that promote active engagement in peacemaking. Our findings suggest that the cortical alpha rhythm plays a crucial role in sustaining intergroup bias and addresses its impact on concrete intergroup experiences. The results highlight the need to provide opportunities for active peace-building dialogue to youth reared amidst intractable conflicts. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the key factors that influence behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. The study was conducted in three countries namely, Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan. The study was considered significant considering the advancements in technology that have had an unprecedented impact on education, and the need to conduct learning online due to the COVID-19 to pandemics. The research adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and extended it by including other variables including culture, social distancing, and absorptive capacity. The study was conducted using the quantitative methodology, where the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was collected from a sample from each of the three countries, and sample sizes were 455, 490, and 513 for Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan respectively. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analysis. The results of the study indicated that effort expectancy and culture significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention to use MOOCs in all three countries. As well, absorptive capacity is mediated significantly by performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions have a significant influence on MOOCs in both Thailand and Pakistan. Social influence has a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Thailand, hedonic motivation and price value have a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Poland, and the habit has a significant factor in Pakistan. The keys aspects influencing behavioral intention to Use MOOCs were different in Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan, in various factors which are performance expectancy, social distancing, price value, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The research recommended that it is important to evaluate the situation and prevailing conditions of the concerned country, before implementing the MOOCs and the associated online learning practices. © 2022 Chaveesuk et al.

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly important in modern den-tistry, we aimed to assess patients’ perspectives on AI in dentistry specifically for radiographic caries detection and the impact of AI-based diagnosis on patients’ trust. Methods: Validated questionnaires with Likert-scale batteries (1: “strongly disagree” to 5: “strongly agree”) were used to query partici-pants’ experiences with dental radiographs and their knowledge/attitudes towards AI as well as to assess how AI-based communication of a diagnosis impacted their trust, belief, and understanding. Analyses of variance and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) were used (p < 0.05). Results: Patients were convinced that “AI is useful” (mean Likert ± standard deviation 4.2 ± 0.8) and did not fear AI in general (2.2 ± 1.0) nor in dentistry (1.6 ± 0.8). Age, education, and employment status were significantly associated with patients’ attitudes towards AI for dental diagnostics. When shown a radiograph with a caries lesion highlighted by an arrow, patients recognized the lesion significantly less often than when using AI-generated coloured overlays highlighting the lesion (p < 0.0005). AI-based communication did not significantly affect patients’ trust in dentists’ diagnosis (p = 0.44; OLR). Conclusions: Patients showed a positive attitude towards AI in dentistry. AI-supported diagnostics may assist communicating radiographic findings by increasing patients’ ability to recognize caries lesions on dental radiographs. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Thoughts travel faster and farther through cyberspace where people interact with one another regardless of limitations in language, space, and time. Is a poll sufficient to measure people’s opinions in this era of hyperconnectivity? This study introduces a deep learning method to measure online public opinion. By analyzing Korean texts from Twitter, this study generates time-series data on online sentiment toward the South Korean president, comparing it to traditional presidential approval to demonstrate the independence of the masses’ online discourse. The study tests different algorithms and deploys the model with high accuracy and advancement. The analysis suggests that online public opinion represents a unique population as opposed to offline surveys. The study model examines Korean texts generated by online users and automatically predicts their sentiments, which translate into group attitudes by aggregation. The research method can extend to other studies, including those on environmental and cultural issues, which have greater online presence. This provides opportunities to examine the influences of social phenomenon, benefiting individuals seeking to understand people in an online context. Moreover, it helps scholars in analyzing those public opinions—online or offline—that are more important in their decision making to assess the practicality of the methods. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - People's news diets are shaped by a diverse set of selection biases that may be unconscious in nature. This study investigates whether providing individuals with information about such unconscious biases attenuates selective exposure. More specifically, in two selective-exposure experiments among Dutch ingroup members focusing on ethnic (N = 286) and religious (N = 277) minorities, we expose individuals to their unconscious prejudices as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) before documenting their news-selection patterns. Findings indicate that the effectiveness of this awareness-inducing strategy depends upon existing levels of implicit and explicit prejudice and overly expressed acceptance of the IAT scores. This implies that raising awareness of implicit prejudice works as an effective strategy for fighting biased news selection for some, but may backfire for others, and should therefore only be implemented with caution and attention for explicit considerations. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, national lock-downs and stay-at-home orders were implemented by many countries to curb the rate of infection. An extended stay-at-home period can frustrate people’s need for relatedness, with many turning to social media to interact with others in the outside world. However, social media use may be maladaptive due to its associations with social media addiction and psychosocial problems. Our study was set at this special context to examine the associations among social media addiction, two aspects of relatedness needs (i.e., satisfaction and frustration), and two prominent psychosocial problems (i.e., depressive symptoms and loneliness). The participants were 1048 residents of the U.K. or U.S. (46% men, mean age = 44.10 years, SD = 12.59, age range: 18–65). The results indicated significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and social media addiction as well as significant positive associations between social media addiction and the two types of psychosocial problems. More importantly, both of these significant associations were strong enough to partially explain the significant positive associations between relatedness need frustration and the two types of psychosocial problems. These findings provided some support for relatedness need frustration as a motivation of social media addiction. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The research on people–place relations makes an important contribution to the understanding of the public responses to renewable energy technologies (RETs). Social media not only provides easy access to the sentiments and attitudes of online users towards RETs, but social media content can also shape the discourse, both on-and offline, about RETs. Hence, social media content analysis provides valuable insights into the public responses to RETs. However, as of now, only a small number of studies have investigated people–place relations in the context of the energy transition via online content. To address this lack of knowledge, this study aims to increase the understanding of people–place relations by investigating the relationship between the place scales mentioined in Instagram posts (categorized from local to planet) and the sentiments that are expressed in said posts, depending on different energy infrastructures (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, powerlines, and renewable energy in general). Our analysis of 1500 Instagram posts shows that the place scales that are mentioned in the Instagram posts are related to some differences in the post emotionality, and that these effects differ across the different hashtags that are related to RETs. By using a sociocog-nitive approach, this study is the first to investigate Instagram posts in the context of the energy transition and people–place relationships. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Makerspaces and hacklabs are believed to encourage a positive attitude towards gaining computer skills. Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category ‘Woman’ is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term ‘women’), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one’s own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The research aims to examine the relationships between the constructs of entrepreneurial intention according to the theory of planned behavior (TPB) model and subjective well-being (SW). The model used considers the works proposed by Liñán and Chen and Oyanedel, Vargas, and Paez, and a questionnaire was applied to 1043 people in an urban population of the three main regions of Chile using multivariate statistical methods for its analysis (structural equation models). The proposed hypotheses are that subjective well-being towards entrepreneurship has a direct and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (H1), personal attitude towards entrepreneurship has a direct and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (H2), perceived behavioral control towards entrepreneurship has a direct and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (H3), and subjective norm towards entrepreneurship has a direct and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention (H4). The results indicate that subjective well-being on entrepreneurial intention shows indirect effects mediated by subjective norm, contributing to the theoretical development concerning well-being incidence on entrepreneurial behavior, providing theoretical elements that can serve as a basis for further strengthening the understanding of the relationships between personal well-being, economic growth, and the harmonious relationship with the environment. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Despite the widespread application of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) to various services, there has been relatively little research carried out on pedestrian–AV interaction and trust within the context of service provided by AV. This study explores the communication design strategy promoting a pedestrian’s trust and positive attitude to driverless services within the context of pedestrian–AV interaction using non-verbal social cues. An empirical study was conducted with an experimental VR environment to measure participants’ intimacy, trust, and brand attitude toward AV. Further understanding of their social interaction experiences was explored through semi-structured interviews. As a result of the study, the interaction effect of social cues was found, and it was revealed that brand attitude was formed by the direct effects of intimacy and trust as well as the indirect effects of intimacy through trust’s mediation. Furthermore, ‘Conceptual Definition of Space’ was identified to generate differences in the interplay among intimacy, trust, and brand attitude according to social cues. Quantitative and qualitative results were synthesized to discuss implications considering the service context. Practical implications were also addressed suggesting specific design strategies for utilizing the sociality of AV. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background This study explored students’ perceptions of COVID-19 risks and preventive measures and assessed the impacts of the national lockdown on students in Uganda. Methods A web-based survey was conducted to explore students’ perceived risks of COVID-19 and preventive measures; sources of COVID-19 information and impacts of the lockdown. Both undergraduate and post-graduate students (n = 398) participated in the study. Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS-26. Results Students acknowledged COVID-19 as a health risk, and their preventive behaviours were influenced by age, gender, marital status and living situation. Most students followed face mask guidelines but did not comply with lockdown restrictions. Social distancing was not always possible due to overcrowding. Students’ main sources of COVID-19 information were local media (e.g., TV, radio) and social media. Most students (especially females) were unable to access online learning platforms due to poor internet connectivity, high costs and no access to computers. Meanwhile, a majority of those who studied online did not enjoy the experience. Students experienced depression, frustration, stress and anxiety during the lockdown; became less physically active and spent most of their time on social media, sleeping, eating or watching movies. Some students indulged in smoking, drinking alcohol, taking drugs and gambling for their first time, while others did them more often than before. Copyright: © 2022 Niba Rawlings et al.

AB  - Social distancing and the expansion of the digital environment due to the impact of COVID-19 are raising the need for digital literacy among the elderly for overall social participation such as mutual communication, health care, and education. The purpose of this study was to identify the correlation between digital literacy, loneliness, quality of life, and health promotion behaviors among the elderly aged between 65 and over and under 75 years. The data collection for this study was from May 1 to June 1, 2021, after approval from the C University Bioethics Review Committee using online questionnaires for 159 young-old elderly living in Korea. This study was a descriptive correlation study to understand the relationship between these variables for the young-old elderly. The collected data were analyzed using IBM SPSS WIN/25.0. The general characteristics were frequency, mean, and standard deviation, the difference of variables according to the general characteristics was analyzed by t-test and one-way ANOVA, and post-analysis was analyzed by Scheffe's test. The correlation between each variable was analyzed using Pearson's correlation. The subjects' digital media literacy was positively correlated with quality of life and health promotion behavior. Loneliness was inversely correlated with quality of life and health-promoting behavior. Quality of life was positively correlated with health-promoting behavior. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that digital literacy education programs for the elderly in the future are necessary to reduce the elderly's feeling of loneliness and improve the quality of life and health promotion behaviors. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how adolescents accessed, understood, appraised, and applied information on pandemic preventive measures, how their lives were impacted by long-lasting regulations and how they described their quality of life. Methods A qualitative design with focus group interviews was used to elaborate on the quantitative survey results obtained and analyzed in a previous survey study from the first phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. Five focus groups with seventeen adolescents were conducted digitally during the second pandemic phase in November and December 2020. The interview data were analyzed with directed content analysis. Results The adolescents reported using traditional media and official websites as sources for Covid-19 information. They engaged in preventive behavior, and washing hands and keeping a distance from strangers had become a habit. However, not being physically close to friends felt strange and unpleasant. The measure most frequently discussed was limiting social contact, which was a constant struggle. No one disputed the authorities’ guidelines and rules, but the social restrictions caused boredom and despair, particularly due to interrupted schooling and missed opportunities to engage in life events, and freely socialize with friends. Conclusion The adolescents gave an overall impression of being health literate, which corresponds well with the results from our previous survey study. Their descriptions of how they translated protective measures into their everyday lives demonstrate that they took responsibility and accepted personal costs for the collective good. However, life with social restrictions decreased their quality of life. Copyright: © 2022 Riiser et al.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most important ways of fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. However, vaccine hesitancy and refusal can reduce adherence to vaccination campaigns, and therefore undermine their effectiveness. Although the scientific community has made great efforts to understand the psychological causes of vaccine hesitancy, studies on vaccine intention have usually relied on traditional detection techniques, such as questionnaires. Probing these constructs explicitly could be problematic due to defense mechanisms or social desirability. Thus, a measure capable of detecting implicit attitudes towards vaccination is needed. To achieve this aim, we designed and validated a new test called the Vaccine-IRAP, or V-IRAP, which is a modified version of the original Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure, or IRAP, task. The V-IRAP allows the unspoken reasons behind vaccine hesitancy to be investigated, and is able to distinguish between positive and negative beliefs on vaccination. The test was assessed in a sample of 151 participants. The V-IRAP showed good internal reliability and convergent validity, with meaningful correlational patterns with explicit measures. Moreover, it revealed incremental validity over such explicit measures. Lastly, the V-IRAP was able to shed light on the implicit attitudes involved in vaccine refusal, revealing negative attitudes relative to vaccine-related risks in non-vaccinated participants. Overall, these results support V-IRAP as a sensitive and reliable tool that could be used in future studies on implicit attitudes toward vaccination. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic radically affected the whole education system including nursing education. Nursing is a practice-based profession; therefore, it is necessary to transform acquired knowledge into practice. However, in the current situation of the pandemic, the nursing students were unable to learn and practise nursing skills in the skills lab on manikins or simulation. This paper aims to give an overview and practical application of alternative solutions to overcome this situation. Alternatives like virtual skills teaching along with sign-off were sought by using problem-solving approaches to facilitate students' learning and help them to acquire necessary skills timely. © 2022 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

AB  - Background: There is evidence that extraversion and associated frequent personal and digital social contacts are associated with mental health, reflected in reduced risk for anxiety or depression. However, excessive social media use (SMU) has been related to a decrease of mental health. We test how extraversion moderates the effect of SMU on anxiety and depression in times of social distancing. Methods: Data were collected with an app-based survey combined with passive sensing of social media usage time. We analyzed SMU (objective average duration of communication app usage) and cross-sectional questionnaire data from 486 adults (mean age = 42.42). Using multiple regression models, we tested how SMU, extraversion and their interaction relate to individual depression and anxiety scores. Results: Depression scores were associated with a higher SMU and lower extraversion. There was a significant positive relationship between SMU and extraversion that predicted higher depression scores. Limitations: In the present sample, there is a recruitment bias since only data from smartphones running iOS were included. Future research should also take a closer look at the purpose behind SMU. Conclusions: We conclude that extraversion might be a protective factor for depression which can turn into a harmful one if it is related to higher SMU. Thus, the interplay between SMU and extraversion needs to be considered when predicting individual differences in mental health. © 2022

AB  - —Overcrowding and crowd density monitoring in various places and establishments are being implemented since the pandemic, which helps observe social distancing. This study is about the development of a crowd density solution by utilizing YOLOv4 and Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) called CrowdSurge. The practice of CCTV has been around for so many years with proven benefits. This has been combined with the state-of-the-art YOLOv4 algorithm that provides high video analytics and object detection performance. With the combination of the said technology and algorithm, it will serve as a smart surveillance system. A system and mobile application have been developed, and the YOLOv4 deep learning detection model was used to detect various set of scenarios considered to assess if the model executes according to the actions assigned in the experimental set-up. The browser-based application was tested using CVSS or Common Vulnerability Scoring system, which shows that the severity level of most vulnerabilities is low and has a minor impact on the system. Based on the overall usability testing and statistical results, the respondents are satisfied with both surveillance system and mobile applications developed in terms of functionality, usefulness, and aesthetics. Therefore, using the developed system in real-time surveillance can aid in crowd density reduction in an area. © 2022.

AB  - International metropolises are key sites of outbreaks of COVID-19 cases. Global public evaluation of the pandemic in international cities is affected by many factors. This study examines how media exposure affects this evaluation and how media trust and media bias perception moderate the relationship between them. Based on an online survey of the evaluation of 13 international cities’ pandemic performances by 1171 citizens from 11 countries, this study conducted a multi-level stepwise regression analysis and discovered that: (1) different forms of media affect global citizens’ perceptions of international metropolis COVID-19 pandemic performance differently; and the role of traditional paper media, including newspapers and magazines, is of little significance in comparison to electronic media. (2) Among electronic media, TV and broadcasting have the greatest impact, followed by social media and the Internet. (3) Media trust and media bias perception affect people’s evaluations of international urban pandemics, but our survey reveals that they only function with regard to social media. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This article explores front-line cruise employees’ interaction with LGBT passengers. Covert data were gathered with 70 staff, many of whom were from developing countries where attitudes to LGBT people can be less accepting. Encounters are illuminated using Allport's (1954) intergroup contact theory. Interactions between staff and gay passengers were largely positive, helping normalise homosexuality and diminish negative attitudes. Staff interactions were moderated by factors such as prior knowledge of gay people, their previous service experience on gay charters, gender, the influence of working for gratuities and the sense of fun onboard. The gay cruise provides the context that gives rise to moderating conditions, which then facilitate the mediating processes such as reduced intergroup anxiety and increased cultural learning of gay lifestyles. Suggestions for future research between cruise companies and their employees explore how other variables may positively influence staff service-gay customer interactions. Managerial implications are offered for the cruise sector. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Many states have become concerned with Russian cyberattacks and online propaganda. The Ukrainian government responded to the information threat in 2017 by blocking access to several Russian websites, including VKontakte, one of the most popular social media websites in Ukraine. By exploiting a natural experiment in Ukraine, I find that the sudden censorship policy reduced activity on VKontakte, despite the fact that a vast majority of the users were legally and technically able to bypass the ban. Users with strong political and social affiliations to Russia were at least as likely to be affected by the ban as those with weak affiliations. I argue that the ease of access to online media—not political attitudes toward the state—was the main mechanism behind the users’ response to the ban. These findings suggest that this pragmatic view on the effects of censorship holds, even in the highly politicized military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which later evolved into a full-scale Russian invasion. © 2022 Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - Purpose: To support the wellbeing of both patients and their families, our aim was to investigate the satisfaction of non-COVID in- and out-patients regarding safety measures implemented at our radiology unit of a transplant institute against COVID infection. Materials and Methods: Over a five-month period, adult patients’ feedback was obtained by a questionnaire on the fear of contracting COVID-19 during a radiology examination, the perceived delay in treatment, and the following safety measures implemented: modified schedules to limit the number of patients in the waiting area and to maximize social distancing; assistance by staff when visitors were not admitted; cleaning and disinfection of machines; mask wearing and hand hygiene of staff; and staff advice on hand hygiene and infection control precautions. Results: Over a five-month period, our preliminary results (387 patients) showed general patient satisfaction (99.1%) with safety measures applied at our radiology unit. Patients were satisfied with distancing and assistance by staff (100%), cleaning and disinfection (91%), mask wearing and hand hygiene of the staff (97%), and staff advice (94%). There was some criticism of the perceived delay in treatment (7.3%) and in the scheduling of the waiting list (5.4%), with 5.4% fearing contracting the virus. Patients’ awareness of safety measures and confidence in the hospital preparedness policy was perceived by all interviewers, and 100% appreciated being questioned. Conclusion: The feedback given by the non-COVID patient helps to measure the quality in health care, to improve the quality service, and to protect and satisfy more vulnerable patients, also during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, Italian Society of Medical Radiology.

AB  - In the West, Islam has been historically ‘othered’ as a religion and frequently linked to negative media representation, terrorism, and fundamentalism. As the aftermath of 9/11 witnessed a global rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric and action, there was a parallel increase in academic research on the Muslim community, including adults, youth, and children. In this paper, a systematic literature review was undertaken to explore how empirical studies over the last two decades have investigated experiences of growing up as young Muslims in an age of Islamophobia. Based on objective inclusion and exclusion criteria, pertinent databases were searched for research with contextual, temporal, topical relevance. NVivo Plus software was used for content-coding, quantitative processing, and qualitative thematic analyses of data. A rigorous screening process resulted in the identification, compilation, and methodical review of 87 journal articles, between 2001 - 2021, on the topic ‘Islamophobia and Young Muslims.’ The descriptive analysis represented that there has been a substantial increase in empirical studies on young Muslims in the last five years, particularly in the field of educational studies. A majority of these studies covered experiences of adolescent Muslims, between 13-20 years, residing in western countries like U.K., U.S.A., and Australia. Qualitative research designs were frequently employed, with a sample size of >50 participants. Through the word-count frequency output of NVivo, four meaningful and recurrent themes of ‘Islamophobia’, ‘Identity’, ‘School’, and ‘Women’ were derived. Content analysis of these themes revealed that studies widely researched on diverse interpretations of Islamophobia in the lives of young Muslims, identity negotiation strategies adopted by Muslim minority youth, school-based religious bullying, and gendered facets of Islamophobia. Research gaps showed a requirement for studies that capture heterogeneous narratives of Muslim youth in non-western countries and early childhood settings. Future research recommendations are of a unique child or youth-based theoretical conceptualization of Islamophobia, that particularly highlights youth perspectives of their own lived realities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This study assesses Jordanian community pharmacists’ readiness and willingness to deliver vaccination services in their practice sites. Between February and April 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was distributed via social media, WhatsApp messages, and personal communication. The questionnaire targeted practicing community pharmacies. Descriptive and inferential data analysis was carried out. A total of 403 community pharmacists participated in the study. Almost 146 (36%) community pharmacists reported vaccinating patients in their practice sites. However, readiness assessment revealed that only 54 (13.4%) pharmacists received the required training and qualifications. Moreover, 33 (8.2%) study participants worked in adequately equipped and designed community pharmacies. Overall, surveyed participants held positive attitudes toward their involvement in vaccination services: 260 (64.5%) pharmacists were willing to vaccinate patients, and 227 (65.0%) out of unready, unqualified, participants were willing to get needed training and qualifications. According to study participants, regulatory and professional bodies (Ministry of Health, Jordan Pharmacists Association) are influential in supporting pharmacist-vaccinators. Among the investigated factors, organizational structure and employment status were significantly associated with pharmacists’ readiness to deliver vaccination. This study revealed that further work is needed to increase pharmacists’ and pharmacies’ readiness to deliver vaccination services and that regulators should follow a more active approach in highlighting the importance of training and the impact of training in patients’ safety and satisfaction. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: To build complex digital skills and capability required by digitally-driven work environments, we must first understand nursing students' baseline digital literacy if educators are to develop a fit for purpose curriculum underpinned by digital health technologies. Objective: To determine first-year pre-registration nursing students' perceived baseline digital literacy before their first clinical placement. Design: Prospective cohort study. Settings: Two universities in Australia in 2020. Participants: Students enrolled in pre-registration nursing programs at Bachelor's and Master's level. Methods: Participants (N = 205) completed an online 27-item survey composed of a Likert-type scale, forced-choice items, and open-ended questions. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Results: Participants engaged with digital technology early in life, with 49.75% students using some form of digital technology before ten years of age. Students reported the highest daily use of technology to search the internet for information (92%), online social networking (68.3%) and watching videos (67%). Most students expressed the least confidence in identifying different types of portable storage devices (24.1% Master's students; 41.7% Bachelor's students), describing the advantages of a digital camera (39.3% Master's students; 48.3% Bachelor's students), and totaling numbers in spreadsheets (22.8% Masters students; 48.3% Bachelor's students). No statistical differences were observed between the two universities or the two cohorts in terms of perceived confidence in using technology and software applications to support their learning. Interestingly, 24.7% of participants expressed high confidence in using electronic medical records without prior training, which may reflect positive attitude towards engaging with unknown digital technologies. Conclusions: Nursing students are frequent internet and social media users. However, despite positive attitudes to digital technology and widespread presence of digital technology in students' lives, deficits in students' confidence in using digital technology and software required for learning persist. Targeted digital literacy education interventions are needed as part of foundational nursing studies to improve nursing students' baseline digital literacy before commencing clinical placement. These should be scaffolded across the program to ensure an effective transition to nursing practice in evolving digitally-driven healthcare environments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Hazardous drinking among college students persists, despite ongoing university alcohol education and alcohol intervention programs. College students often post comments or pictures of drinking episodes on social media platforms. Objective: This study aimed to understand one university’s student attitudes toward alcohol use by examining student posts about drinking on social media platforms and to identify opportunities to reduce alcohol-related harm and inform novel alcohol interventions. Methods: We analyzed social media posts from 7 social media platforms using qualitative inductive coding based on grounded theory to identify the contexts of student drinking and the attitudes and behaviors of students and peers during drinking episodes. We reviewed publicly available social media posts that referenced alcohol, collaborating with undergraduate students to select their most used platforms and develop locally relevant search terms; all posts in our data set were generated by students associated with a specific university. From the codes, we derived themes about student culture regarding alcohol use. Results: In total, 1151 social media posts were included in this study. These included 809 Twitter tweets, 113 Instagram posts, 100 Greekrank posts, 64 Reddit posts, 34 College Confidential posts, 23 Facebook posts, and 8 YouTube posts. Posts included both implicit and explicit portrayals of alcohol use. Across all types of posts reviewed, positive drinking attitudes were most common, followed by negative and then neutral attitudes, but valence varied by platform. Posts that portrayed drinking positively received positive peer feedback and indicate that drinking is viewed by students as an essential and positive part of university student culture. Conclusions: Social media provide a real-time picture of students’ behavior during their own and others’ heavy drinking. Posts portray heavy drinking as a normal part of student culture, reinforced by peers’ positive feedback on posts. Interventions for college drinking should help students manage alcohol intake in real time, provide safety information during alcohol use episodes, and raise student awareness of web-based privacy concerns and reputation management. Additional interventions for students, alumni, and parents are needed to address positive attitudes about and traditions of drinking. © Madison N Cirillo, Jennifer P Halbert, Jessica Gomez Smith, Nour Sami Alamiri, Karen S Ingersoll.

AB  - Uncertainty, fear, and distress have become prevalent in the lives of U.S. residents since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unpredictable reality of social distancing, shutdowns, and isolation have affected daily routines and influenced well-being and health. Drawing on consumer culture theory, we conducted an exploratory study to examine the mediating role of consumer spirituality in the subjective well-being of religious Christians during COVID-19 and to discover links between well-being and health outcomes. Participants from the United States (n = 104) were recruited via a Qualtrics’ online panel. Findings show that religiosity among Christians enhanced subjective well-being, demonstrating the positive effect of religious beliefs, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, spiritual consumption mediated this relationship, suggesting the importance of possessions to religious expression and subjective well-being. Implications for messaging about health and well-being are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Patients with cancer are a population at high risk of severe infection from SARS-CoV-2. Patients with cancer regularly attend specialised healthcare centres for management and treatment, where they are in contact with healthcare workers (HCWs). Numerous recommendations target both patients with cancer and HCWs to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2 during these interactions. Objective: To investigate the parallel evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic in these 2 populations over time, we studied the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies after both the first and second waves of the pandemic, and in both cancer patients and HCWs from a single specialised anti-cancer centre. Factors associated with seropositivity were identified in both populations. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study after the second wave of the COVID pandemic in France. All participants were invited to undergo serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 and complete a questionnaire collecting data about their working conditions (for HCWs) or medical management (for patients) during this period. Results after the second wave were compared to those of a previous study among 1011 patients with cancer and 663 HCWs performed in the same centre after the first wave, using the same evaluations. Findings: We included 502 HCWs and 507 patients with cancer. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was higher after the second wave than after the first wave in both HCWs (15.1% versus 1.8%; p < 0.001), and patients (4.1% versus 1.7%; p = 0.038). By multivariate analysis, the factors found to be associated with seropositivity after the second wave for HCWs were: working in direct patient care (p = 0.050); having worked in a dedicated COVID-19 unit (p = 0.0036); contact with a person with COVID-19-positive in the workplace (p = 0.0118) or outside of the workplace (p = 0.0297). Among patients with cancer, only a contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 was found to be significantly associated with positive serology. The proportion of reported contacts with individuals with COVID-19-positive was significantly lower among patients with cancer than among HCWs (7.6% versus 40.7%, respectively; p < 0.0001) Interpretation: Between the first and second waves of the epidemic in France, the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies increased to a lesser extent among patients with cancer than among their HCWs, possibly due to better self-protection, notably social distancing. The risk factors for infection identified among HCWs plead in favour of numerous intra-hospital contaminations, especially for HCWs in contact with high-risk patients. This underlines the compelling need to pursue efforts to implement strict hygiene and personal protection measures (including vaccination) to protect HCWs and patients with cancer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) status is far from the national target in China. To identify the modifiable factors associated with EBF of infants aged under 6 months in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 provinces/municipalities across China in 2017–2018. We used multistage stratified cluster sampling and collected data through face-to-face interviews with mothers using an electronic questionnaire. Totally, 5287 pairs of mother–infant aged <6 months were investigated. The EBF prevalence was 29.2% (1544/5287). Mothers with correct knowledge of colostrum (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.62), EBF (AOR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) and the highest scores of perceptions for breastfeeding benefits (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.61) were more likely to exclusively breastfeed. However, mothers with more frequent unwillingness of breastfeeding during the first month postpartum were less likely to practice EBF (AOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.90). Infants having their first breast milk within 24 h of birth increased the odds of EBF (AOR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.13). Infants were less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the families in which the main caregiver was the grandmothers. Mothers without receiving infant formula feeding suggestions via the health facilities, media, or the Internet (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.85) or without the experience of infant formula feeding in public (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.72) might more likely to practice EBF. To acquire comprehensively correct knowledge and keep a positive attitude of breastfeeding for the mothers are crucial for improving the EBF prevalence. Family supports are potential interventions worth focusing on. Infant formula promotion remains a great barrier for EBF in China. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: Parenting support policies increase the period that the mother and child spend together after childbirth, which is expected to facilitate breastfeeding. Additionally, the mother's attitudes towards parenting may influence her willingness to breastfeed. The objective of this study was to identify the association of breastfeeding duration with parenting support policies and mothers’ attitudes towards parenting. Design: This study employed a cross-sectional design. Setting: The study was conducted using data from South Korea's 2018 National Survey on Fertility and Family Health and Welfare. Participants: Data of women with children born on or after January 2016 to September 2018 (N = 1,861) were analysed using Cox's proportional hazard regression model with the duration of breastfeeding as the outcome variable. Measurements and findings: The main predictors comprised social policy factors (hospital environment and parenting support) and individual factors (mothers’ attitudes towards parenting). The median duration of breastfeeding was 5 months. Not initiating breastfeeding within 1 h of birth (hazard ratio = 1.215, 95% confidence interval 1.07–1.37, p = .002) and a negative attitude towards the necessity of having children (hazard ratio = 1.153, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.30, p = .021) were associated with a shorter breastfeeding duration after controlling for age, occupation, number of pregnancies, number of births, and the infant's birth weight. However, social policy factors were not associated with breastfeeding duration. Key conclusions and implications for practice: This study shows that breastfeeding within 1 h of birth as well as a positive attitude regarding the necessity of having children may increase the duration of breastfeeding. Therefore, the midwives and nurses in hospitals should encourage mothers to initiate breastfeeding within 1 h of birth. In addition, the government should improve positive attitudes towards parenthood amongst young adults. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of propositions concerning the consequences of price (un)fairness perceptions in personalized pricing based on individual consumer characteristics or customers’ previous purchase behavior. In three online experiments, we analyze consequences of personalized pricing for price-favored and price-disadvantaged customers in an e-commerce setting. Results reveal negative attitudinal and behavioral reactions to personalized pricing for both disadvantaged and even favored customers, mediated by price fairness perceptions. Respondents’ aversion to personalized pricing is confirmed by a second study applying a within-subject design. In addition, we evaluate consumers’ responses to various levels of information sensitivity in personalized pricing mechanisms and find that consumers generally refuse personalized pricing approaches regardless of the underlying personal data1. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To examine the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, for COVID-19 in Arkansas and Kentucky and investigate the impact of policies and preventative measures on the variability in Rt. Methods: Arkansas and Kentucky county-level COVID-19 cumulative case count data (March 6-November 7, 2020) were obtained. Rt was estimated using the R package ‘EpiEstim’, by county, region (Delta, non-Delta, Appalachian, non-Appalachian), and policy measures. Results: The Rt was initially high, falling below 1 in May or June depending on the region, before stabilizing around 1 in the later months. The median Rt for Arkansas and Kentucky at the end of the study were 1.15 (95% credible interval [CrI], 1.13, 1.18) and 1.10 (95% CrI, 1.08, 1.12), respectively, and remained above 1 for the non-Appalachian region. Rt decreased when facial coverings were mandated, changing by -10.64% (95% CrI, -10.60%, -10.70%) in Arkansas and -5.93% (95% CrI, -4.31%, -7.65%) in Kentucky. The trends in Rt estimates were mostly associated with the implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures. Conclusions: Arkansas and Kentucky maintained a median Rt above 1 during the entire study period. Changes in Rt estimates allow quantitative estimates of potential impact of policies such as facemask mandate. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Sexting (sending, receiving, and forwarding nude, semi-nude, or sexually explicit content) entails risks for adolescents; therefore, it is important for parents to be able to communicate with their children about its implications. The goal of the present study was to identify parental characteristics that lead to dysfunctional communication (lower quality of communication) about sexting, on a sample of 427 parents (336 mothers and 91 fathers) of Israeli adolescents aged 10–18 years and to determine whether parents’ perceived severity of sexting and the degree to which they perceive their adolescent to be susceptible to sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of questionnaires online. Findings indicated that authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent–child communication about sexting. Authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes toward sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity of their children’s sexting activities, and the degree to which their children were susceptible to engage in sexting. The quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents appears to have enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and to adjust their communication about the inherent risks. Findings suggest that the perception of sexting as too risky diminishes parents’ ability to conduct a high-quality discussion about it. In conclusion, research findings emphasize parents’ role in mediation of the online experiences of their children and conducting a constructive discussions with them about sexting. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Health information seeking is critical to medical decision-making and optimal health. Although researchers have begun to explore how people with disabilities search for health information, no studies have investigated health information seeking by women with physical disabilities. Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the health information seeking experiences of women with physical disabilities. Method: We conducted a series of semi-structured, online focus group meetings with 21 women with disabilities. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Two broad themes emerged: 1) pathways to information on general health; sexual and reproductive health; as well as bowel, bladder, and other pelvic health issues; and 2) perceived facilitators and barriers to obtaining health information. Information pathways differed by the type of information sought. Internet was a commonly used resource, with a high value placed on social media interaction among peers. Self-advocacy emerged as a prominent facilitator of health information seeking. Barriers identified were lack of disability-related education, limited accessibility, and providers’ negative attitudes. Conclusion: This is the first known in-depth qualitative exploration of health information seeking by women with disabilities. Study findings revealed pathways to information commonly used by women with disabilities. The study also identified notable gaps and challenges to health information seeking including the need for improved provider education and training.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the behavior of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. No data exists on how gender influences the adherence of individuals with cancer to COVID-19 related public health guidelines and their preferred methods of receiving COVID-19 related information. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults with cancer. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and women. Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative measures was 44.9-58.8% for males and 53.4-68.1% for females. After adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.45, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not touching face (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive information from their cancer institutes and social media. Discussion: Gender-specific interventions are needed to improve the adherence of males to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Information should be disseminated via cancer institutes and social media as these are the preferred sources of COVID-19 related information among AYAs with cancer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Religious attitudes can have a strong influence on environmental beliefs and behavior, both positively and negatively. This work investigates opposing influences of religion of environmentalism through individual differences in Religious Fundamentalism and Spirituality. In two studies with U.S. samples (total N = 909), Spirituality predicted stronger belief in climate change, moralization of environmental actions, and behavioral intentions to conserve energy and reduce waste, while Religious Fundamentalism negatively predicted these same attitudes. Positive effects of Spirituality on environmental attitudes were partly mediated though trait compassion and moral foundations of harm and fairness. Negative effects of Fundamentalism were partly explained through differences in Right-Wing Authoritarianism. Together, opposing influences of Spirituality and Fundamentalism were better predictors of environmental concerns than general religiosity, and held when controlling for political attitudes. We conclude that religious environmentalism is best predicted through the combined effects of Spirituality and Fundamentalism as a function of underlying social-moral attitudes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the global COVID-19 pandemic, governments from many countries in the world implemented various restrictions to prevent the SARS-Cov-2 virus's spread, including social distancing measures, quarantine, in-home lockdown, and the closure of services and public spaces. This led to an in-creased use of social media platforms to make people feel more connected, but also to maintain physical activity while self-isolating. Concerns about physical appearance and the desire to keep or reach a muscular and toned ideal body, might have further reinforced the engagement in fitness-related social media activities, like sharing progresses in training achievements or following more fitness contents on popular profiles. To better understand the underlying relation among these factors, the present study investigates 729 responses to the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and their association to social media usage and compares the results cross-culturally in five countries (Spain, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Japan, and Hungary). Findings highlight significant differences between males and females, espe-cially in regard to the time spent online (U = 477.5, p = 0.036). Greater levels of appearance anxiety were associated with the exposure to fitness-related contents on social media. These results strongly confirm the previously highlighted association between fitspiration media and body image anxiety predominantly in females. Clinical implications and future considerations in terms of prevention and treatment in a situation of global emergency are also discussed. © 2022

AB  - Background: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe immune dysfunction. Methods: A literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane, and Clinical trials.gov from the date of inception to 12/08/2021. We identified 19 original studies reporting data on COVID-19 in HSCT recipients after screening 292 articles. Data were extracted following preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines. Quality evaluation was done using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool. Inter-study variance was calculated using Der Simonian–Laird Estimator. Pooled analysis was conducted using MetaXL. A random-effects model was used to estimate the proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 6711 patients in 19 studies, 2031 HSCT patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were analyzed. The median age of patients was 56.9 (range 1–81.6) years, and 63% patients were men according to 14 studies. The median time from transplant to SARS-CoV-2 infection for autologous (auto) and allogeneic (allo) HSCT patients was 23.2 (0.33–350.5) months and 16.4 (0.2–292.7) months, respectively. The median follow-up time after COVID-19 diagnosis was 28 (0–262) days. The COVID-19 mortality rate was 19% (95% CI 0.15–0.24, I2= 76%, n = 373/2031). The pooled mortality rate was 17% (95% CI 0.12–0.24, I2= 78%, n = 147/904) in auto-HSCT patients and 21% (95% CI 0.16–0.25, I2= 60%, n = 231/1103) in allo-HSCT patients. Conclusions: HSCT recipients have a high risk of mortality and clinical complications due to COVID-19. There is a need for ongoing vigilance, masks, and social distancing, vaccination, and aggressive management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HSCT recipients. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This study investigated the connections between religious ideology, authoritarianism, intergroup relations, and political orientation. Building from the psychological literature on religious belief, the current study sought to explore the extent of these relationships using a university sample from the American South. The Diverse Learning Environments survey was administered to undergraduate students, with 2582 responding. Variables of interest were religious belief, authoritarianism, intergroup relation views, diversity-related actions, and political views. Results suggest that while general religious orientation did not correlate positively with authoritarianism, Christians, specifically those associated with Evangelical groups, displayed greater authoritarianism than non-believers and reported fewer diversity-related interactions. While results indicated that more salient religious identity was associated with right-leaning political beliefs, an unexpected finding was that non-belief was associated with greater political involvement. These results suggest patterns of ingroup favoritism among conservative Christians which may lead to outgroup derogation and influence voting patterns. © 2022 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.

AB  - This research examined the association of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) with the evaluations of the government's anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policies and performance. In Study 1 (N = 261), we found that SDO and RWA were positively associated with resistance to criticism about the government's anti-COVID-19 measures. In addition, SDO was positively associated with favorable evaluations of the government's performance in handling the crisis. Support for lockdown policies mediated these attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 438), the results show that SDO and RWA had indirect associations with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system through three mediation variables. Evaluations of the US government's performance in handling the COVID-19 pandemic were negatively associated with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system, and there was a negative relationship between evaluations of the Chinese and US governments’ performances. © 2022 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues.

AB  - The present study aimed to understand how status-oriented individual differences such as narcissistic antagonism, narcissistic extraversion, and moral grandstanding motivations may have longitudinally predicted both behavioral and social media responses during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Via YouGov, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults was recruited in August of 2019 (N = 2,519; Mage = 47.5, SD = 17.8; 51.4% women) and resampled in May of 2020, (N = 1,533). Results indicated that baseline levels of narcissistic antagonism were associated with lower levels of social distancing and lower compliance with public health recommended behaviors. Similarly, dominance oriented moral grandstanding motivations predicted greater conflict with others over COVID-19, greater engagement in status-oriented social media behaviors about COVID-19, and lower levels of social distancing. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social distancing and quarantines have major negative psychological implications. Our aim was to study the rate of pediatric hospitalizations due to anorexia nervosa (AN) during the first year of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as compared to previous years, with regard to clinical and laboratory parameters. This is a retrospective study in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Israel. Data regarding inpatient hospitalizations due to AN were retrieved, then epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters compared. During the entire study period, 275 hospitalizations were due to AN: 94 patients were admitted during the 12 months of the pandemic as compared to a yearly mean of 45.25 during 2015–2019, resulting in a 2.4-fold increase (p < 0.001). The mean admission age and female predominance were similar in the two study groups. The weight of the patients at admission was higher during the COVID-19 period (44.5 kg vs. 41.2 kg, p = 0.004), and fewer patients had clinical signs typical of AN upon physical examination (p = 0.022). There was a 35% reduction in median hospitalization duration (9 days [IQR 8.21] in 2020–2021 and 14 [IQR 6, 16.75] days in 2015–2019, p = 0.01). No other differences were found. Conclusions: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the number of adolescents hospitalized with AN. Nevertheless, disease characteristics were not more severe as compared to the preceding 5 years.What is Known:• Social distancing and quarantines were announced during the COVID-19 pandemic in numerous countries. These measures have potential negative psychological effects on adolescents.What is New:• During the COVID-19 pandemic period, there was an increase in the number of hospitalizations of adolescents with AN, although disease characteristics were not more severe as compared to the preceding 5 years. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - As individuals spend more time with mobile devices, concerns over screen time have grown, and thus so have efforts to reduce it. Even with mixed evidence for screen time's negative effects, mindfulness about mobile phone use has emerged as a coping mechanism and intervention strategy. This study uses an online survey (N = 405) to investigate whether general mindfulness and perceptions of one's phone use predict the use of Apple's Screen Time feature to track mobile screen time. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model, results indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use predict positive attitudes toward the feature, intention to use it, and actual use of it. However, mindfulness is a negative predictor of usefulness, indicating that those who are already more mindful find this feature less useful. Perceived time spent on one's phone was not related to perceived usefulness and thus did not predict use of the feature in the overall model. These results provide theoretical implications for the role of mindfulness in communication technology use, for predicting the adoption of screen time tracking tools, and practical implications for how to design these features for users based on their perceptions of their screen time and of screen time tracking. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccine uptake is an urgent public health priority. Purpose: To identify psychosocial determinants (attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control) of COVID-19 vaccination intentions for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic adults, and how COVID-19 misperceptions, beliefs about the value of science, and perceived media bias relate to these determinants. Methods: Longitudinal online survey using two national samples (18-49 years old/50 years and older), each stratified by racial/ethnic group (n = 3,190). Data were collected in October/November 2020 and were weighted by race group to be representative. Results: Path analyses showed that more positive attitudes about getting vaccinated predict intention across age and racial/ethnic groups, but normative pressure is relevant among older adults only. Belief in the value of science was positively associated with most determinants across all groups, however the association of COVID-19 misperceptions and perceived media bias with the determinants varied by age group. Conclusions: Messages that emphasize attitudes toward vaccination can be targeted to all age and racial/ethnic groups, and positive attitudes are universally related to a belief in the value of science. The varying role of normative pressure poses messages design challenges to increase vaccination acceptance. © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, we ask how well Australian households are matched to their neighbourhood social environments. We broadly replicate a previous study of matching and ask to what extent households live in communities that are similar in socio-economic status to their characteristics. And, when households move, do they relocate in such a way as to increase similarity to their neighbours? The processes are at the heart of understanding the urban structure, how it changes over time and the links to urban inequality. The article uses data on household incomes from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamic (HILDA) Survey to measure the degree of similarity between households and their neighbours. We study the variation in matching for the population as a whole, and by quintiles of median neighbourhood income. We also measure how individuals that change neighbourhoods increase their similarity to the destination neighbourhood. We find that with respect to matching there is considerable diversity in the levels of matching; and that with respect to residential change, households in general do not make major shifts to increase matching when we control for housing tenure and other household characteristics. There is a need for further replications to understand the nature of matching and the outcomes. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2021.

AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people’s attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people’s attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who ‘just happen to be gay’. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Support for democracy is based on warmth, inclusiveness, and a general belief that others are well-intentioned. It is also related to a willingness to respect the rights of outgroups which do not necessarily share the views of one’s ingroup. In this research, we analysed the relationships between different types of national identity and support for democracy. In two surveys (Study 1; American participants, n = 407 and Study 2; Polish participants; n = 570), we found that support for democracy was negatively linked to collective narcissism, measured in relation to the national group, previously associated with negative intra- and inter-group outcomes. The effect of national narcissism on democracy support was present even when accounting for national identification. In Study 2, we also found that this effect was mediated by social cynicism – a negative view of human nature. In both studies, support for democracy was positively linked to a secure national identity, that is national identification without the narcissistic component, which tends to be associated with positive attitudes towards others. We discuss implications for understanding the role of national identity in support for (il)liberal politics. © 2021 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - Aims: To describe nurse anesthetists’ attitudes towards the importance of parental presence during their child's anaesthesia induction and to explore associating factors. Design: A cross-sectional design. Methods: Nurse anesthetists from 55 Swedish hospitals were asked to participate (n = 1,285). A total of 809 completed the questionnaire, Families' Importance in Nursing Care-Nurses' Attitudes (FINC-NA) during 2018. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Nurse anesthetists generally had a positive attitude towards the importance of parental presence. They reported a more positive attitude in family as a resource in nursing care (median = 40) followed by family as a conversational partner (median = 25), family not as a burden (median = 17) and family as its own resource (median = 13). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that working in a district hospital, working only with children, having routines/memorandum about parental presence, being a woman, allowing both parents to be present in their child's anaesthesia and greater experience of children's anesthesia, were associated with a more positive attitude. Conclusion: This nationwide survey contributes important knowledge for understanding nurse anesthetists' attitudes and the result shows that nurse anesthetists generally have a positive attitude towards the importance of parents. Areas of improvement were, however, identified; the nurses tend to not value family as its own resource and family as a conversational partner highly. Impact: Nurse anesthetists have a crucial role in children's anesthesia care since the quality of parental presence experience depends on a positive attitude from the nurses. Parental involvement is important to establish a child-centered anaesthesia care, which should be highlighted in the education of nurse anesthetists. Parental involvement should also be addressed in healthcare policies and routines should be established. © 2021 The Authors. Journal of Advanced Nursing published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic older adults are asked to maintain physical distancing, which can be linked to loneliness. While older people are encouraged to use electronic communication to stay socially connected, it remains an open question whether electronic contacts are related to lower loneliness during the pandemic. This study examined the associations of physical distancing during the pandemic with loneliness and the role of in-person and electronic contacts with children and non-kin as explaining these associations across European regions. Methods: The study used data from Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), collected during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Mediation and moderation analyses tested the direct and indirect associations between physical distancing, contact frequency and loneliness, as well as the differences across European regions. Results: The results indicate that adults who reported higher frequency of physical distancing also felt lonelier during the pandemic. This association was partly explained by social contacts—those who practiced physical distancing maintained less in-person contact with children and non-kin and less electronic contact with non-kin, which were related to feeling lonelier. Adults in Southern European countries felt lonelier and reported more frequent contacts. The moderation analyses showed that the link between physical distancing and loneliness was found in the northern region, but not in the southern and eastern regions of Europe. Conclusion: This study can indicate that attention should be paid to adults who may struggle to maintain social contacts in light of physical distancing guidelines. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Waste sorting is an important aspect of environmental protection, which is now being enforced on a large scale in China. More broadly, it is beneficial to improve the implementation strategies for waste sorting policy and programmes. This study analyses the psychology of consumers that influences the mechanisms of consumer waste sorting and the governmental policies influencing consumers’ attitudes and behaviours. About 295 validated participants were collected from four regions of China. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship among consumers’ internal motivation, government’s external publicity and consumer behaviour, and the Hayes’ PROCESS macro was used to test mediating effect and moderating effect. The results show that consumers’ internal motivation and government’s external publicity have a positive effect on consumer behaviour. Consumer attitude played a complete mediating role between consumers’ internal motivation and consumer behaviour. Between the government’s external publicity and consumer behaviour, consumer attitude played a complementary mediating role. Consumers with self-transcendence values, positive motivation of waste sorting and the government’s external publicity had a greater positive impact on their attitudes than consumers with self-enhancement values. The greater the material benefits and psychic income consumers received from waste sorting, the more it promoted a positive attitude to consumer behaviour. The article puts forward some management suggestions to improve the government’s implementation of its waste sorting policy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: The attitudes of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccines ensure that health services are able to run without interruption and potentially have a role in the messaging about vaccination that they convey to the public. Hence, healthcare workers’ attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. Findings: Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID-19 vaccine were divided into three themes: “influencing factors,” “priority group” and “trust.”. Conclusions: Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID-19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence-based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. Practice Implications: Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence-based information about the vaccines. © 2021 NANDA International, Inc.

AB  - The study integrates social-psychological and educational research to examine the relations between preservice teachers’ race-related perceptions of Black students and the instructional approaches they endorse. Based on survey and race Implicit Association Test data from preservice teachers (N = 258; White = 82%) in the United States, we predicted that the association between motivation to be unprejudiced and motivation to appear unprejudiced would predict endorsement of culturally and motivationally supportive instructional practices via implicit and explicit biases about Black students. Path analyses revealed significant mediated associations among motivation to be unprejudiced and endorsed instructional approaches and practices via explicit bias, contingent on the motivation to appear unprejudiced. Furthermore, it is troubling to note that White preservice teachers, in contrast to their ethnic minority counterparts, displayed significant implicit preference for White over Black students. Implications of these findings for preparing a culturally responsive and motivational supportive teaching task-force are discussed. © 2021

AB  - Background: Many women internalize negative attitudes regarding body shape and size because of the societal standards for women’s ideal body shapes and sizes. Internalized weight stigma is related to poorer physical and psychological health. A growing body of research has documented the links between other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., HIV-stigma) and poor sleep quality; however, little research examines the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep or the mechanisms that explain this relationship. Internalized weight stigma may be associated with poor sleep through increases in psychological distress. This study hypothesized that the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep would be mediated by higher levels of depression and anxiety. Methods: About 257 women were recruited via social media, word of mouth, and an undergraduate participant pool. Participants completed an online survey assessing various aspects of weight stigma and health through self-report questionnaires. Most women were non-Hispanic White (86.8%) and had a mean age of 31.40. Results: The indirect effects of internalized weight stigma on poorer global sleep quality and daily disturbances through depression and anxiety were significant. In contrast, depressive symptoms but not anxiety explained the links between internalized weight stigma and perceived sleep quality and neither depressive symptoms nor anxiety explained the link between internalized weight stigma and sleep efficiency. Conclusions: Internalized weight stigma is linked to poorer sleep quality, and these links may be explained by psychological well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which internalized weight stigma is associated with sleep quality can inform the psychological interventions employed. © 2021, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - The emergence of anti-immigration parties in mature democracies has triggered various reactions. These reactions, including stigmatization of these parties and prosecution of their members for hate speech, may have unintended consequences. What are the effects of these responses on the electoral support for these parties? Using an experimental approach, we confront a sample representative of the Dutch electorate with one of six versions of a manipulated news video about a new anti-immigration party. We find that stigmatization of the party reduces the propensity to vote for that party, and even more so if it is mentioned that a prominent member is prosecuted for hate speech than if not. Either way, the effect is moderated by anti-immigrant attitude and mediated by the party’s perceived legitimacy. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Increasing dentists’ visibility in the media to make the case for sugary beverage taxes can help advance public policy that improves oral health outcomes. We assessed California dentists’ media engagement behaviors related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention and correlates of engaging in such behavior. Methods: Survey items related to sugar policies and media engagement were embedded in an electronically distributed statewide survey of dentists’ tobacco cessation counseling behaviors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent characteristics, perceived professional responsibility to discuss selected topics with patients, and attitudes and behaviors related to sugar restriction policy and media communication. Multivariable models identified independent correlates of media engagement. Results: Of 624 respondents, most had never talked to traditional media (78%) or posted to social media (64%) about sugar or sugar policies for dental caries prevention. Respondents with the highest level of media engagement were more likely to agree that sugary beverage taxes are effective at reducing dental caries, that they had support from dental professional organizations to talk to the media, that it is realistic for patients to reduce their sugar consumption, and that sugar and sugary drinks are extremely harmful to health. Conclusions: Efforts to increase dentists’ media engagement related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention should address dentists’ negative attitudes toward the effectiveness of sugar restriction policies and may require increased support from dental professional societies. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Study findings identify dentists’ low engagement in media advocacy to support sugar restriction policy adoption. The results identify correlates of media engagement and of dentists’ willingness and confidence to act, which could serve to inform interventions to support and enhance engagement. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2021.

AB  - High levels of economic inequality are widely viewed as a key challenge facing both advanced industrial and developing economies. Country-level studies have consistently shown a negative link between income inequality and trust in others. This is typically attributed to greater social distance within unequal societies. Do we observe similar relationships within organisations? This is an important question because employee trust is associated with important outcomes for workers and organisations. We answer it by investigating the relationship between pay inequality and employee trust in managers at the workplace level using large-scale nationally representative matched employer–employee data from Britain. The article uses innovative machine learning methods to demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between pay inequality and trust. When pay inequality is at low to moderate levels, increasing inequality is associated with increasing employee trust but when pay inequality passes a certain threshold the relationship turns negative. The relationship is mediated by employees’ perceptions of manager fairness and moderated by employee collective voice. The implications of these findings for theory, research methodology, practice and future studies are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In recent years, the co-occurrence of the migration crisis and terrorist attacks in European cities have created a strong link between refugees and asylum seekers and terrorism in the minds of many Europeans. This study investigates how attitudes toward refugees are associated with fear of terrorism. Using multilevel modelling on 1,500 Belgian citizens nested in 402 municipalities, results indicate that positive attitudes toward refugees are associated with lower terrorism fear. Adverse economic conditions at both the individual and municipal level are associated with greater fear of terrorism, while a large outgroup size is associated with lower fear of terrorism. Women hold greater fear than men, while commercial news consumption is associated with greater terrorism fears. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Despite the rise of interest in nonprofit organizations’ (NPOs) retention strategies and organizational behaviour micro-mechanisms, little research has specifically addressed volunteers’ religiosity and attitude towards the organization, and their links to motivation and intention to stay with NPOs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of religiosity as an antecedent of volunteers’ intention to stay with the organization, and the mediating role of both volunteers’ motivation and attitude towards the organization in such a relationship. Building on motivational functions theory and the theory of planned behaviour, a conceptual model is proposed and empirically tested using bootstrapped multiple mediation analysis on a sample of 379 volunteers of NPOs located in Italy. The results support the role of religiosity as a significant predictor of volunteer intentions, and the mediating role of motivation and attitude on this relationship. Volunteers who are driven by their religious values are likely to develop a stronger motivation to volunteering and a positive attitude towards NPOs’ activities, and consequently a stronger willingness to stay with the organization. The study contributes to the literature on NPOs by stressing the role of antecedents and underlying mechanisms affecting volunteers’ motivation and, in turn, their intention to stay with the organization. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.

AB  - This study explores how televised football in Poland serves as a site for the (re)construction of discourses surrounding race and ethnicity and to what extent this squares with previous studies on sport media conducted mainly in Western countries. In our analysis, we identify the discourses surrounding race and ethnicity that the commentators in televised football draw on and examine how they relate to hegemonic discourses and categorizations in wider Polish society. Our findings show that Polish football commentators draw on transnationally circulating racialized/ethnicized discourses on assumed superior physicality when talking about Black football players and on supposed negative psychological capabilities when talking about White Southern European football players. The findings also show that when talking about non-Polish players and head coaches, the commentators regularly rely on an us-versus-them frame that constructs foreign influences as a threat. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the number of applied HPV vaccine doses before (from April 2019 to March 2020) and after (from April 2020 to September 2020) social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in states and regions of Brazil. Methods: Ecological time-series study, using data from the Brazilian National Immunization Program (PNI). Using the Mann-Whitney test, we evaluated the difference between the median number of applied doses during the periods April 2019 to March 2020 and from April 2020 to September 2020. Spatial analysis identified clusters with a high or low percentage reduction in the median applied doses. Prais-Winsten regression models identified temporal trends in the applieddoses from both periods. Results: There was a significant reduction in the median HPV vaccine doses applied, formation of spatial clusters and, after a sharp drop in the number of applieddoses during the months following social distancing. There was a tendency to increase the applied vaccines doses. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduction of the number of HPV vaccine doses applied as a possible effect of restrictive measures caused by the pandemic.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is important for health. However, there is little evidence on how weight stigma, time spent on sedentary activities (including smartphone, social media, online learning), time spent on outdoor activity, and nomophobia associate with PA among Chinese individuals with consideration of gender. The present study examined the aforementioned associations in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Methods: University students (N = 3,135; 1,798 females, 1,337 males) with a mean age of 19.65 years (SD = 2.38) years completed an online survey from November to December, 2021. The online survey assessed weight stigma (using the Perceived Weight Stigma Scale and Weight Bias Internalization Scale), PA (using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form), time spent on different activities (using self-designed items for time on smartphone, outdoor activity, social media, and online learning), and nomophobia (using the Nomophobia Questionnaire). Parallel mediation models were constructed (dependent variable: PA; mediators: perceived weight stigma, weight-related self-stigma, time spent on smartphone, time spent on outdoor activity, time spent on social media, and time spent online learning; independent variable: nomophobia) and evaluated using Hayes' Process Macro Model 4 (IBM SPSS 20.0). Results: Weight-related self-stigma (β = −0.06; p = 0.03), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.21; p < 0.001), time spent on social media (β = 0.07; p = 0.02), time spent on online learning (β = 0.06; p = 0.03), and nomophobia (β = −0.07; p = 0.01) were all significant factors explaining the PA among female participants. Perceived weight stigma (β = −0.07; p = 0.01), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.27; p < 0.001), and time spent on online learning (β = 0.10; p = 0.002) were all significant factors explaining PA among male participants. Conclusion: Chinese healthcare providers should design programs on weight stigma reduction and outdoor activity improvement to enhance PA among university students.

AB  - Background: There is increasing evidence on the exponential use of technology-based social media in medical field that has led to a proliferation of unprofessional behaviors in digital realm. Educating, training, and changing the behaviors of healthcare professionals are essential elements to restrain the rising unprofessional incidents. Therefore, this research was designed to determine the impact of an interventional workshop on the medical and dental students in improving their professional behaviors in the digital world using the newly developed medical Education e-Professionalism (MEeP) framework. Methods: We adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a benchmark reference which explores constructs intertwined with the mission-based MEeP framework; values (whistleblowing-raising concerns), behaviors (being responsible in the digital world) and identity (reflective practice in the digital world). A multicentre 3-phased mixed-method study was conducted using a pre-workshop survey, an online interventional workshop, and a post-workshop survey. SPSS and NVivo were the tools used for the data analysis. Results: A total of 130 students registered for workshop out of which 120 completed the pre-workshop survey, 62 joined the workshop and 59 completed the workshop and post-workshop survey. From the whistleblowing – raising concern perspective, we found that attitudes and perceived behavioral control had a significant relationship. While for responsible in digital world category, attitude and perceived behavioral control had a significant bearing on the intentions. Third, for reflective practice, attitude and subjective norms significantly enhanced the intention of participants. A multi layered thematic analysis yielded four overarching themes of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intentions. Most students showed positive attitudes of being reflective, self-directed, and humane. Students realized the subjective norms had made them conscientious, self-aware and conformative. While perceived behavioural control manifested as identity and Intentions were heavily reliant on self-actualization. Conclusion: Our mixed method study found that the interventional workshop using MEeP framework significantly improved attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. This study provides valuable evidence of MEeP framework evaluation using the theoretical underpinning of TPB by reporting positive changes in professional values, behaviors, and identities of undergraduate medical and dental students.

AB  - Purpose: As self-service technologies (SSTs) become more prevalent, service providers are actively encouraging customers’ involvement with these technologies, sometimes even forcing their customers to use SSTs. This paper aims to examine the influence of the SST-only (vs full-service) mode on customers’ negative attitude toward SST providers through the mediating mechanism of powerlessness and explores how SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism moderate the impacts of the SST-only mode on powerlessness. Design/methodology/approach: Three experiments were performed, study 1 tested the main and mediating effect and studies 2 and 3 verified the moderating effects. Findings: The results suggest that customer perceived powerlessness mediates the relationship between SST-only (vs full-service) mode and negative attitude toward SST providers. When the levels of SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism are high, the impacts of SST-only on powerlessness are attenuated. Alternative mediating mechanism of powerlessness is examined and ruled out. Research limitations/implications: Future research should investigate other moderators that may reduce the impacts of SST on customer powerlessness. These moderators could be service-operating procedures, SST interface design, types of service situations and customer characteristics. In addition, other consequences of powerlessness, other than the negative attitude toward SST providers and intention to switch investigated here, should be investigated as well. Practical implications: This research provides guidelines helping service providers to improve their customers’ SST usage experience by showing both SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism may alleviate the negative effects of SST-only mode on customer perceived powerlessness more effectively. Originality/value: This research examines the role of customers’ psychological reactions toward the SST-only mode, particularly from the perspective of power and control. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Introduction Critical questions remain about COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness (VE) in real-world settings, particularly in middle-income countries. We describe a study protocol to evaluate COVID-19 VE in preventing laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers (HWs) in Albania, an upper-middle-income country. Methods and analysis In this 12-month prospective cohort study, we enrolled HWs at three hospitals in Albania. HWs are vaccinated through the routine COVID-19 vaccine campaign. Participants completed a baseline survey about demographics, clinical comorbidities, and infection risk behaviours. Baseline serology samples were also collected and tested against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and respiratory swabs were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Participants complete weekly symptom questionnaires and symptomatic participants have a respiratory swab collected, which is tested for SARS-CoV-2. At 3, 6, 9 months and 12 months of the study, serology will be collected and tested for antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and spike protein. VE will be estimated using a piecewise proportional hazards model (VE=1-HR). Baseline data From February to May 2021, 1504 HWs were enrolled. The median age was 44 (range: 22-71) and 78% were female. At enrolment, 72% of participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. 56% of participants were vaccinated with one dose, of whom 98% received their first shot within 4 days of enrolment. All HWs received the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol and procedures were reviewed and approved by the WHO Ethical Review Board, reference number CERC.0097A, and the Albanian Institute of Public Health Ethical Review Board, reference number 156. All participants have provided written informed consent to participate in this study. The primary results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal at the time of completion.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic might have affected older adults’ personal and general views on aging (VoA) because they were frequently, particularly during the early phase of the pandemic, portrayed as a homogeneous, vulnerable group in the media and in public debates. Also, their higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease progression as well as other pandemic-related stressors and restrictions might have impacted how older adults perceive their own aging. In this study, it was examined to which extent middleaged and older adults’ personal and general VoA changed due to the pandemic by distinguishing between normative age-graded change across multiple measurement occasions and potentially pandemic-specific history-graded change. Multiple VoA indicators (personal VoA: attitude toward own aging, subjective age, awareness of age-related change [gains and losses]; general VoA: domain-specific age stereotypes) of 423 German adults aged 40 years and older were assessed across three prepandemic measurement occasions (2012, 2015, and 2017) and one occasion after the pandemic’s outbreak (summer 2020). Normative agegraded changes and pandemic-specific changes were estimated and compared using longitudinal multilevel regression analyses. Both perceived age-related gains and age-related losses decreased between 2012 and 2017, but increased thereafter between 2017 and 2020. Further, the overall change trend toward less positive attitude toward own aging slowed down from 2017 to 2020. There was also a slight trend toward younger subjective ages from 2017 to 2020. For most age stereotypes, pandemic-specific trends indicated a shift toward more negative stereotypes. These findings suggest that pandemic-specific changes in VoA are multidirectional, comprising perceptions of both losses and gains. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to investigate consumers' food waste prevention behaviour through the lens of an extended theory of planned behaviour. The extension includes the examination of the role of social media usage in affecting consumers' decision-making process of food waste prevention behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire is developed based on measurement items of previously validated studies. 210 samples are collected and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that social media usage has a significant influence on attitude and injunctive norms. In addition, intention can be predicted by injunctive norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control but not attitude. Lastly, the intention to reduce food waste is a significant predictor of food waste prevention behaviour. Originality/value: Overall, the extended theory of planned behaviour is useful in explaining consumers' food waste prevention behaviour. Interestingly, this study reveals that a negative attitude towards food waste behaviour does not translate into the intention to engage in food waste prevention behaviour. Furthermore, it is found that social media usage plays a significant in shaping consumers' attitudes towards food waste and injunctive norms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Perspective-taking (PT) is an important ability to imagine the world from another’s point of view. Prior studies have shown that younger adults are more likely to consider the opinions of age-based in-group members relative to out-group members. However, the cause of this priority is still unknown. We conducted three independent studies to explore the effect of intergenerational contact on younger adults’ PT toward older adults and the possible roles of stereotyping and intergroup anxiety. A total of 192 college students completed the Perspective taking Scale in Study 1 after being primed with age-based intergroup relationships. The results indicated that younger adults found it more difficult to take the perspective of older adults than that of their peers. 200 college students completed the Prior Contact Scale, Intergroup Anxiety Scale, Negative Stereotype Scale, and PT Scale in Study 2. The results demonstrated that intergenerational contact improved PT toward older adults by disrupting negative stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety moderated this mediating relationship. A total of 215 college students completed the PT Scale in the context of imagining intergenerational contact in Study 3. Interestingly, imagined contact effectively increased younger adults’ ability to take older adults’ perspectives. The present research verifies that contact is important for influencing younger adults’ emotional (intergroup anxiety) and attitudinal (stereotyping) factors that are critical to improving younger adults’ ability to take older people’s perspectives. This is of great significance for developing harmonious intergenerational relationships. Copyright © 2022 Long, Jiang, Wang, Zhou and You.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have suggested that the pandemic impact on mental health could vary according to gender. We aimed to evaluate the gender influence in the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries in the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis employing the Facebook–COVID-19 Symptom Survey developed by the University of Maryland. We categorized gender as men, women, and non-binary. The outcomes were the presence of anxiety or depressive symptoms, measured with two adapted questions extracted from the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). We used generalized linear models from the Poisson family, considering the survey's complex sampling. We calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and explored interactions with gender using the adjusted Wald test. Results: We included 1,338,320 adults from LAC countries; 48.0, 50.6, and 1.4% were men, women, and non-binary participants, respectively. The overall prevalence of anxiety or depressive symptoms was 44.8 and 46.6%, respectively. We found interactions between gender and the rest of the independent variables. In the non-binary group, the association between age and anxiety symptomatology was lost after an age of 55 years. Furthermore, whereas living in a town was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology in men and women, this did not happen among non-binary individuals. Compliance with physical distancing was associated with a lower prevalence of anxiety and depression symptomatology among women (anxiety: PRa = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.97–0.99; p < 0.001, depression: PRa = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.95–0.97; p < 0.001) and only anxiety in non-binary participants (anxiety: PRa = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.88–0.98; p = 0.005). This was not evidenced among men participants (anxiety: PRa = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.96–1.01; p = 0.199, depression: PRa = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.96–1.00; p = 0.084). In addition, compliance with handwashing was associated with a higher prevalence of anxiety symptomatology among men (PRa = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.05–1.11; p < 0.001) and women participants (PRa = 1.03; 95% CI = 1.01–1.05; p = 0.016). Conclusion: Approximately 4 out of 10 participants had anxiety or depressive symptoms. Women and non-binary gender people had more symptoms of anxiety or depression. The factors associated with these symptoms varied according to gender. It is essential to evaluate gender-related strategies to improve mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to gain insight into factors that impact employee readiness to change and organizational change management. Therefore, an integrative research model is developed with the combination of perceived competence, perceived relatedness, perceived autonomy, codification strategy and personalization strategy to investigate employee readiness to change. The research model tests the mediating role of employee readiness to change between factors underpinned self-determination theory, knowledge management strategy and organizational change management. In addition to the moderating role of self-efficacy is examined between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation. Design/methodology/approach: This research is conducted under a positive paradigm, and therefore, a quantitative research approach is incorporated to design a research strategy. The research model is empirically tested with a sample size of 361 employees working in commercial banks of Pakistan. For data analysis, the structural equation modelling approach is applied. Findings: Empirical findings indicate that altogether perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, codification and personalization strategies had explained 76.8% variance in employee readiness to change. The effect size analysis shows that codification strategy has the largest impact in determining employee readiness to change. Therefore, the relatedness of employee tasks stands at the second stage in determining employee readiness to change. The predictive relevance of the research model is computed through blindfolding procedure and revealed substantial predictive relevance in measuring employee readiness to change. The findings of the research confirmed that the relationship between employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation will be stronger when self-efficacy is higher. Practical implications: The current research has several contributions to theory and practice. Theoretically, this research extends the self-determination theory with knowledge management strategy and enriches literature in employee readiness to change and organizational change management context. Practically, this research suggests that policymakers should focus on factors underpinned by self-determination theory and knowledge management model to develop a positive attitude among employees towards readiness to change. Similarly, self-efficacy is another important factor that moderates the relationship between readiness to change and change implementation and should be considered for managerial implication. Originality/value: This research is significant as it integrates two unique models, namely, the self-determination framework and the knowledge management model to investigate employee readiness to change. In addition to that, the research model is extended with the moderating effect of self-efficacy between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - China is accused of conducting disinformation campaigns on Taiwan's social media. Existing studies on foreign interventions in democratic societies predict that such disinformation campaigns should lead to increasing partisan polarization within Taiwan. We argue that a backlash effect, making Taiwan's citizens more united against China, is equally plausible. We conduct a survey experiment exposing participants to a real-life rumour and rebuttal to test these competing hypotheses. We find, at best, mixed evidence for polarization. Although neither rumour nor rebuttal mention China, there is consistent evidence of backlash against China. Most notably, participants across the political spectrum are more inclined to support Taiwanese independence after viewing the rumour rebuttal. These findings indicate that citizens may put aside partisanship when confronted with false news that is plausibly linked to an external actor. We conclude by discussing the broader applicability of our theory and implications for cross-Strait relations. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Despite efforts to decrease the burden, vaccine hesitancy is increasing worldwide and deterring efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 after the approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This study aims to assess levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and predictors of hesitancy for pregnant women attending antenatal care in Ethiopia. Methods: Facility-based cross-sectional study was employed among 336 pregnant women from April 7 to June 10, 2021. The systematic random sampling technique was used to select pregnant from three health centers. Epi-Data version 3.2 and STATA/14 software were used for both data entry and analysis, respectively. A Logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the strength of association at P<0.05. Result: This study included 336 pregnant mothers who were booked ANC in three health centers. The overall levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant mothers were 79.17 %(95%CI: 74.5--83.2). Whereas, having poor attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines (AOR=9.4; 95%CI: 3.7--21.1, P<0.001), monthly income ≤118.5 US dollar (AOR =6.3; 95%CI: 2.9--12.2, P<0.002), Mother who are illiterate and started ANC (AOR=9.5; 95%CI: 4.6--22.6, P<0.001), Being unplanned pregnant (AOR =7.5; 95%CI: 3.6-11.2, P<0.002), first time ANC initiated (AOR =4.2; 95%CI: 2.9--15.1, P<0.001), and pregnant didn’t used social media (AOR= 6.0: 95%CI: 2.5--14.6, P< 0.02) were significantly associated with COVID-19 Vaccine hesitance. Conclusion: The acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant mothers was insufficient compared with previous research. Health care workers should provide health education during ANC visits to change their negative attitude and reassurance for the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. © 2022 Lifescience Global.

AB  - Teachers’ belief toward students with special educational needs (SEN) in the regular classroom is a condition that may influence the implementation of inclusive education. Nevertheless, some studies suggest that teachers’ attitudes or self-efficacy beliefs toward students with behavioral difficulties (BD) are quite negative, but much less emphasis has been placed on the factors and mechanisms contributing to these attitudes. This study investigates associations between pre-service teachers’ (PT) attitudes toward students with BD, PT’s individual characteristics including self-efficacy beliefs, and PT’s education program characteristics. Participants surveyed were 1,499 PT enrolled in a 4-year teacher education program (bachelor’s degree) in Quebec Province, Canada. Descriptive analysis showed that PT’s report generally positive attitudes toward students with BD on the three components of attitudes, while behavioral components were significantly more positive than the affective and cognitive components. Among the individual characteristics of PTs, the more advanced their academic level, the more negative their attitudes were on all three components. The characteristics related to the teacher education program (general vs. special) and the number of hours of courses on the BD revealed significant differences only on the cognitive component. Results of the mediation analysis further revealed that the association between the PT’s characteristics and the three components of attitudes was mediated by PT’s self-efficacy beliefs. Results are discussed considering their implications for the field of teacher education. Copyright © 2022 Massé, Nadeau, Gaudreau, Nadeau, Gauthier and Lessard.

AB  - Aims The main purpose of this study was to investigate the leveling of barriers to the development of sports volunteering for the disabled in Iran using a structural-interpretive model. Instrument & Methods It was performed based on the purpose of applied research and in terms of data collection by the exploratory mixed method. Participants included professors of sports management, managers, and specialists in the field of the disabled and volunteering in the country. Data collection tools were semi-structured interviews and structural self-interaction matrix questionnaires. In the first part, the data were organized using the thematic analysis method and in the form of basic, organized and comprehensive themes. Also, using the interpretive structural model, the identified obstacles were classified. Findings The results showed that barriers to the development of sports volunteering for the disabled as a comprehensive theme include 54 basic themes and 8 organizing themes which were classified into 3 levels and based on the results of lack of material and spiritual support for disabled volunteering, poor management of sports organizations, Ignorance of laws and macro-politics, non-compliance of sports facilities with the disabled are in the first level and are considered the most important obstacles. Also, in the second level, there is inappropriate media coverage, and in the last level, there are individual restrictions, inappropriate position of volunteering in Iranian sports, and a negative attitude towards the abilities and competencies of the disabled. Conclusion By focusing on removing the identified barriers, we can help a lot in the development of social capital as well as the effectiveness of the performance of sports organizations. © 2022, the Authors.

AB  - This article examines the gendered racialization of Muslim women in Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire (2017) and Samira Ahmed's Internment (2019) and argues that their young South Asian Muslim women protagonists navigate physical and digital spaces to claim their rights as citizens. The article first explores the ways in which the public sphere operates transnationally and has shaped perceptions of Muslims in the United Kingdom and United States since 9/11, and analyzes the role of transnational subaltern counterpublics to resist Islamophobia and state repression. The article then examines the ways in which the young Muslim women in Shamsie's and Ahmed's works fight the xenophobic state, its surveillance regime, and the curtailment of the ability of Muslims to move freely. In both novels, resistance emerges as a transnational subaltern counterpublic in traditional and digital media. The novels underscore the young women's agency in overcoming constraints on their mobility and freedom of speech to claim their rights as citizens and engage in an oppositional public sphere that counters their exclusion. © 2022 University of Tulsa.

AB  - Microblogging, like Twitter, has grown in popularity as a medium for human expression, allowing users to quickly create content on breaking news, public events, or products. The vast volume of microblogging data is a valuable and timely source of public attitudes, views, and opinions on a variety of issues. Users express themselves freely with varied degrees of uncertainty, which makes using microblogs as a data source a tedious task that necessitates the consideration of this factor. We're talking about the uncertainty expressed in microblogs, not the one relative to the claimed information factuality. This aspect of microblogging that we are addressing has gotten little attention, despite the fact that it is critical to understand the degree of ambiguity with which users plan to share information. This topic is particularly relevant to research projects involving information retrieval or investigation in microblogs. In this paper, we present a state of the art on the identification of uncertainty in microblogs with the aim of identifying this issue and describing the current knowledge through the study of similar or related work. We mainly concluded that, to adapt to the characteristics of social media, it is necessary to identify the uncertainty based on the contextual uncertain semantics rather than the traditional cue-phrases, and considering multiple subclasses could provide more information for research on handing uncertainty in social media texts. © 2022 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

AB  - The theme of this BBI-Health special issue is to promote the research, creativity and forward-thinking of future key opinion leaders in the field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI). We asked contributing researchers to identify new ideas and spaces for innovation to map out the future trajectory of our discipline. This special issue provides global and diverse views from early career investigators focused on science, society, and/or policy, with an emphasis on diversity in all its aspects. The common thread weaving through the articles contained in this special issue is that all authors were invited to consider the future of PNI while they were experiencing the global COVID-19 lockdowns that slowed down or even prevented them from access to their “hands-on” research. The contributors vary from Master level to assistant professors, and all have already significantly contributed to the field of PNI. Each contributor has provided a photograph and short biography alongside their written perspectives. We hope that you will enjoy learning about their visions for the future of PNI and will join us with enthusiasm as we watch our field grow through the advancement of their scientific careers. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Information dissemination is not limited to conventional media as the advent of new media has transformed the entire political scenario. In a democratic country like India, people prefer to have information from different media like print media, broadcasting media, outdoor media, and new media, etc., which may impact their political attitude and participation. Therefore, the focus was to study the relative influence of different media on political attitude and political participation. A cross-sectional descriptive research design having a sample of 497 eligible voters was used. OLS regression analysis was used, and it was observed that media use for political information was a significant influencer for political participation, followed by political attitude, political knowledge, interest, and efficacy. Among all, social media was found to have a relatively higher significant positive influence, but traditional media cannot be ignored. The study results will contribute to the conceptualization of media behavior while considering multiple media for political information. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

AB  - To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers’ trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News’ hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76-percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lock-down measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations. © 2021 INFORMS.

AB  - Objective: By increasing the risk of isolation, fear, stigma, abuse, and economic fallout, COVID-I9 has led to an increase in the risk of psychiatric disorders, chronic trauma, and stress. These factors eventually increase suicidality and suicidal behavior. This study intends to evaluate the reasons for suicide attempts due to the COVID-I9 pandemic in the south Indian population. Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: The study was conducted in R. L. Jalappa Hospital and Research Centre, Kolar. Participants: This study was conducted on 9I patients admitted to the general medicine department for a suicide attempt because of the COVID I9 pandemic. Methods: A single examiner conducted a structured interview with a pretested questionnaire with each participant. Participants were asked to indicate the primary reason or motivation for their suicide attempt. Patients answered a set of questions regarding personal and family concerns (marginalization, fear and uncertainty, domestic abuse, loneliness, grief over loss of loved one) and work-related concerns (economic fallout, high-risk environment, shortage of personnel and personal protective equipment [PPE]). We employed mean and standard deviation to descriptively analyze quantitative variables. Categorical variables were expressed in terms of frequency and proportion. For non-normally-distributed quantitative parameters, medians and interquartile range (IQR) were compared across study groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test (> 2 groups). Data was analyzed using coGuide software, V.1.03. Results: The mean age of participants was 29.47±11.06 years, the majority (43.63%) of which were aged between 21 to 40 years of age. The majority (72.53%) of participants reported personal and family concerns as reasons/motivation for suicide, whereas only 17.58% reported work-related concerns. There was a statistically significant difference across reason or motivation for suicide with age (in years) and gender (P value < 0.001). Conclusion: The study concluded that more than half of the patients indicated personal and family concerns as the major reason for suicide attempts during the pandemic. It is vital to emphasize the mental health well-being of the population and take proactive steps to minimize its detrimental effects during the COVID-I9 pandemic. © 2022, Marshfield Clinic.

AB  - India is one of the world’s worst affected countries due to COVID-19 pandemic. The world is struggling to fight against centuries pandemic. Globally governments have been imposed lockdown and restrictions to control situation and minimize spread of infection. Social media was found the most practical and efficient medium to share information and opinions about pandemic. At time of social distancing, social media helped people to share their feelings and find support. Same time overuse of social media platform created panic and misinformation across countries. People sharing unconfirmed information about covid pandemic and governments were found it difficult to handle. © 2022, MedSci Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Information systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly spurred controversies among medical professionals as they start to outperform medical experts in tasks that previously required complex human reasoning. Prior research in other contexts has shown that such a technological disruption can result in professional identity threats and provoke negative attitudes and resistance to using technology. However, little is known about how AI systems evoke professional identity threats in medical professionals and under which conditions they actually provoke negative attitudes and resistance. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate how medical professionals' resistance to AI can be understood because of professional identity threats and temporal perceptions of AI systems. It examines the following two dimensions of medical professional identity threat: threats to physicians' expert status (professional recognition) and threats to physicians' role as an autonomous care provider (professional capabilities). This paper assesses whether these professional identity threats predict resistance to AI systems and change in importance under the conditions of varying professional experience and varying perceived temporal relevance of AI systems. Methods: We conducted 2 web-based surveys with 164 medical students and 42 experienced physicians across different specialties. The participants were provided with a vignette of a general medical AI system. We measured the experienced identity threats, resistance attitudes, and perceived temporal distance of AI. In a subsample, we collected additional data on the perceived identity enhancement to gain a better understanding of how the participants perceived the upcoming technological change as beyond a mere threat. Qualitative data were coded in a content analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed in regression analyses. Results: Both threats to professional recognition and threats to professional capabilities contributed to perceived self-threat and resistance to AI. Self-threat was negatively associated with resistance. Threats to professional capabilities directly affected resistance to AI, whereas the effect of threats to professional recognition was fully mediated through self-threat. Medical students experienced stronger identity threats and resistance to AI than medical professionals. The temporal distance of AI changed the importance of professional identity threats. If AI systems were perceived as relevant only in the distant future, the effect of threats to professional capabilities was weaker, whereas the effect of threats to professional recognition was stronger. The effect of threats remained robust after including perceived identity enhancement. The results show that the distinct dimensions of medical professional identity are affected by the upcoming technological change through AI. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that AI systems can be perceived as a threat to medical professional identity. Both threats to professional recognition and threats to professional capabilities contribute to resistance attitudes toward AI and need to be considered in the implementation of AI systems in clinical practice. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - The current paper describes an effort to develop an integrated theory - integrated mediated intergroup contact (IMIC) model to account for the two types of mediated intergroup contact (parasocial and vicarious) that have been shown to help with prejudice reduction. To this end, our model applies concepts from intergroup contact theory, parasocial and vicarious research, and narrative transportation theory. The present research expands our theoretical understanding of how entertainment media can function as a tool for reducing prejudice toward various outgroups. The IMIC model accounts for the effects of the two types of mediated contact - parasocial and vicarious - and delineates the process of prejudice reduction. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - This article uses a range of disciplinary perspectives to examine what is meant by stigma and explains that it is a relational concept. It argues that there has been a shift from attributing social stigma to whistleblowing, to regarding whistleblowing as a form of prosocial behaviour, that is, something which contributes to the well-being of others. This shift is evidenced by the attempts to establish supportive organisational cultures through the introduction of specialist employer policies and procedures, the existence of protective legislation and the coverage of whistleblowing in the media. Although it is questioned why stigma should still attach to whistleblowing, it is acknowledged that those who suffer reprisals may well seek stigma damages. Thus the article traces the common law and statutory origins of stigma awards and discusses the appropriateness of exemplary/punitive damages in the employment field. In the conclusion, it is advocated that Parliament expressly provide for exemplary/punitive damages to be awarded in employment cases. In addition, practical suggestions are made about how a more positive attitude to whistleblowing can be achieved, including a possible role for criminal sanctions. The author asserts that a more punitive approach is justified because whistleblowing is an important aspect of the human right to freedom of expression which must be fully protected in order to ensure the proper functioning of a democratic society. © 2021 Industrial Law Society; all rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity. Objective: We aim to investigate Twitter users’ attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Canada after vaccine rollout. Methods: We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination–related tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward “vaccination” changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects. Results: After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, “immunity” and “pfizer”) and 6775 opinion terms (eg, “trustworthy” for the positive sentiment and “jeopardize” for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to “vaccine distribution,” “side effects,” “allergy,” “reactions,” and “anti-vaxxer,” and positive sentiments related to “vaccine campaign,” “vaccine candidates,” and “immune response.” These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the “anti-vaxxer” population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the “Covid Zero” population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response. Conclusions: Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Colombia announced the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on March 6, 2020. Since then, the country has reported a total of 5,002,387 cases and 127,258 deaths as of October 31, 2021. The aggressive transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 motivate an investigation of COVID-19 at the national and regional levels in Colombia. We utilize the case incidence and mortality data to estimate the transmission potential and gen-erate short-term forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic to inform the public health policies using previously validated mathematical models. The analysis is augmented by the examination of geographic heterogeneity of COVID-19 at the departmental level along with the investigation of mobility and social media trends. Overall, the national and regional reproduction numbers show sustained disease transmission during the early phase of the pan-demic, exhibiting sub-exponential growth dynamics. Whereas the most recent estimates of reproduction number indicate disease containment, with Rt&lt;1.0 as of October 31, 2021. On the forecasting front, the sub-epidemic model performs best at capturing the 30-day ahead COVID-19 trajectory compared to the Richards and generalized logistic growth model. Nev-ertheless, the spatial variability in the incidence rate patterns across different departments can be grouped into four distinct clusters. As the case incidence surged in July 2020, an increase in mobility patterns was also observed. On the contrary, a spike in the number of tweets indicating the stay-at-home orders was observed in November 2020 when the case incidence had already plateaued, indicating the pandemic fatigue in the country. © 2022.

AB  - Background: Although timely and accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for containing the disease and reducing mental distress, an infodemic, which refers to an overabundance of information, may trigger unpleasant emotions and reduce compliance. Prior research has shown the negative consequences of an infodemic during the pandemic; however, we know less about which subpopulations are more exposed to the infodemic and are more vulnerable to the adverse psychological and behavioral effects. Objective: This study aimed to examine how sociodemographic factors and information-seeking behaviors affect the perceived information overload during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigated the effect of perceived information overload on psychological distress and protective behavior and analyzed the socioeconomic differences in the effects. Methods: The data for this study were obtained from a cross-national survey of residents in 6 jurisdictions in Asia in May 2020. The survey targeted residents aged 18 years or older. A probability-based quota sampling strategy was adopted to ensure that the selected samples matched the population's geographical and demographic characteristics released by the latest available census in each jurisdiction. The final sample included 10,063 respondents. Information overload about COVID-19 was measured by asking the respondents to what extent they feel overwhelmed by news related to COVID-19. The measure of psychological distress was adapted from the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). Protective behaviors included personal hygienic behavior and compliance with social distancing measures. Results: Younger respondents and women (b=0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26) were more likely to perceive information overload. Participants self-perceived as upper or upper-middle class (b=0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30) and those with full-time jobs (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17) tended to perceive higher information overload. Respondents who more frequently sought COVID-19 information from newspapers (b=0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14), television (b=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), and family and friends (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14) were more likely to feel overwhelmed. In contrast, obtaining COVID-19 information from online news outlets and social media was not associated with perceived information overload. There was a positive relationship between perceived information overload and psychological distress (b=2.18, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.26). Such an association was stronger among urban residents, full-time employees, and those living in privately owned housing. The effect of perceived information overload on protective behavior was not significant. Conclusions: Our findings revealed that respondents who were younger, were female, had a higher socioeconomic status (SES), and had vulnerable populations in the household were more likely to feel overwhelmed by COVID-19 information. Perceived information overload tended to increase psychological distress, and people with higher SES were more vulnerable to this adverse psychological consequence. Effective policies and interventions should be promoted to target vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to the occurrence and negative psychological influence of perceived information overload. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - The novel coronavirus outbreak changed the world in 2020 as it rapidly spread from country to country, infecting millions of people across the globe. In response, United States policy-makers and public health officials mandated non-essential businesses to temporarily close to help curb the transmission of the disease. Significant economic strain ensued causing many Americans to lose their jobs and entire industries to suffer. With stores shuttered and fiscal uncertainty impeding consumer spending, retail has been one of the hardest-hit industries. Small businesses in particular have been forced to pivot and grapple with the rippling effects of the pandemic. This journal article features an interview with Nicole Carter, Adjunct Instructor at Drexel University’s Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, about her perspective on how the pandemic is impacting retail and small business. In addition to her work with Drexel, Nicole oversees operations at Benjamin Lovell Shoes, a Pennsylvania and New-Jersey-based shoe retailer, and shares her experience on how the business has adapted since the onset of the pandemic. The goal of this article is to help readers gain a deeper understanding of the current impact that COVID-19 has on small retail businesses, and how that will continue to shape the future of the industry as a whole. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Interview.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has led IBD clinics to adopt a remote monitoring approach in order to guarantee an adequate follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ensure the rules of social distancing. Aim: The aim of the study was to perform a survey on IBD patients who underwent remote monitoring in our tertiary referral center, to assess adherence, patients’ perceptions and satisfaction, and finally their opinions for future monitoring. Furthermore, we evaluated changes in disease activity and Quality of Life (QoL) using validated questionnaires. Methods: Consecutive patients with IBD scheduled for follow-up visits were switched to remote monitoring through e-mail from March 2020 to February 2021. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire focusing on the following elements of the intervention: (1) self-assessment questions, (2) action plans, and (3) educational messages. Results: Four hundred and twenty four Caucasian patients completed the survey. 233 (55.1%) were male, 220 (52.0%) had Crohn’s Disease (CD). Median baseline Mayo Score and Harvey Bradshaw Index were 3 and 4, respectively. 9 (2.1%) patients were referred to the emergency department because of disease flares. 410 (96.9%) patients were satisfied with telemedicine, and 320 (76.5%) patients reported that they would maintain this approach also after COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, on univariate logistic regression analysis, none of the variables were related to patients’ satisfaction or to an improved QoL. The presence of ulcerative colitis was associated with the need for treatment change. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a telemedicine approach is well accepted by patients with IBD and could represent an effective tool in monitoring disease activity. Further controlled studies are warranted to properly assess if telemedicine can replace face-to-face consultations in IBD. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Positive cross-group contact with disadvantaged group members can reduce prejudice, and, under certain conditions, increase solidarity-based action intentions among advantaged group members. In the present work, we distinguish between positive contact (friendly, cooperative) versus politicized contact (where group-based injustice is discussed) as well as between benevolent helping offered to the disadvantaged group versus costly solidarity-based actions. We predict that positive contact is related to benevolent helping, whereas politicized contact is related to willingness to engage in costly solidarity-based activism. In two studies (N = 257, N = 329), results support these hypotheses: for nonmigrants in Germany and the United Kingdom, positive contact with migrants, mediated by empathy, positive emotions, and movement identification, was a better predictor of benevolent helping, whereas politicized contact with migrants, mediated by anger and/or movement identification was a better predictor of endorsement of costly solidarity-based activism. © 2022 Cises.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to describe the perception of dental professionals in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (SA) towards the practice of teledentistry, its usefulness and challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among 190 dentists from January 2021 to April 2021. The participants were included in the study using snowball sampling method. A 26-item adopted questionnaire was distributed using different social media channels. Chi-square test was used for analysis. Results: Out of 190 participants, 46.3% were from Pakistan and 53.7% were from SA. The majority of participants in both countries agreed that teledentistry would enhance guidelines and advice (74.2%), improve peer-to-peer interaction (79.5%) and make patient's referrals more efficient (75.8%). For the usefulness, most participants agree that it is economical for the patients (61.1%), improves communication (74.7%), helps in educating the patients (86.3%), avoid unnecessary travel (76.8%), helps monitoring (71.6%), and benefits patients in remote areas (74.7%); however, more Pakistani participants perceived that time spent with the patient would increase compared to SA participants (p < 0.001) and a higher proportion of SA participants believe that it helps in communication and monitoring of patients (p < 0.001) than Pakistani participants. Regarding the challenges in the use of teledentistry, few participants think that it violates the patient's privacy (22.6%) or is difficult to use (14.7%) or have distrust towards the teledentistry equipment (24.2%). Conclusion: The results indicated a high awareness and a positive attitude towards teledentistry, and its adaptation in their dental practice in both countries. However, limited infrastructure, set-up cost, and information technology (IT) literacy are the main challenges in integrating teledentistry which can be overcome by strategic government initiatives, policies, and programs. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background and Aim: The COVID-19 is a stigmatizing infectious disease even after healing. Until now, no COVID-19 stigma scale validated in Tunisian Arabic language among the general population is available. Developing such tools is necessary to detect COVID-19 stigma and reduce it effectively. Indeed, stigmatization of COVID-19 patients could increase the spread of this disease and its related mental health issues. We aimed at testing the validity of a translated and modified version of the 12-item HIV stigma scale among Tunisian COVID-19 patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between November and December 2020 among a representative sample of COVID-19 patients in the governorate of Sousse, Tunisia, after quarantine. The 12-item HIV stigma scale was translated in Tunisian Arabic and then modified to be adapted to the Tunisian context. The preliminary modified version was administrated to the participants by pretrained medical doctors during phone calls. It consisted on 20 items covering the four stigma dimensions (personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, concerns with public attitudes, and negative self-image). The psychometric evaluation of this version included internal consistency as well as principal component analysis (PCA). Results: The responses of 346 COVID-19 patients were obtained. Their median age was 40 years (interquartile range: 30-54.5). Females represented 60.4% of them. The PCA resulted in a three factor solution with 14 items. This 14-item scale demonstrated good internal consistency with a global Cronbach's α of 0.91 and values of 0.94, 0.93, and 0.98 for social stigma, negative self-image, and disclosure concerns, respectively. Conclusion: This study provides a reliable and valid instrument for stigma measuring among Tunisian COVID-19 patients. The use of this scale would contribute in reducing the spread of this new infectious disease and its related mental health issues. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in 2019 with several unknown factors. The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently developed COVID-19 occupational safety and health (OSH) guidelines to reduce occupational COVID-19 transmission. Many countries also developed their own COVID-19 OSH guidelines, but whether these guidelines included WHO's guidelines and whether including WHO's guidelines in countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines reduced COVID-19 transmission is unknown. Objectives: The objectives of our study were to (1) compare the COVID-19 OSH guidelines of several countries to WHO's OSH guidelines, (2) estimate associations between characteristics of countries and their OSH guidelines and the number of WHO's OSH guidelines included in countries' OSH guidelines, and (3) estimate associations between WHO's OSH guidelines included in countries' OSH guidelines and COVID-19 risk, death risk, and case-fatality proportion. Methods: This study represents international, ecological research of 36 countries from all six world health regions. Countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines were compared with WHO's OSH guidelines. Linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders were used to estimate associations of interest. Results: The median number of WHO's 15 COVID-19 OSH guidelines included in countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines was eight. Countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines focused on workers included significantly more of WHO's COVID-19 OSH guidelines than countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines focused on general populations. Including “provide personal protective equipment for workers” and “create workplace policy for wearing personal protective equipment” in countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines were significantly related to decreased COVID-19 risk, death risk, and/or case-fatality proportion. Conclusions: Countries' COVID-19 OSH guidelines should include WHO's guidelines, focus on workers, and include “provide personal protective equipment for workers” and “create workplace policy for wearing personal protective equipment.”. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Participation in collective action is known to be driven by two appraisals of a social situation: Beliefs that the situation is unfair (injustice appraisal) and beliefs that a group can change the situation (collective efficacy appraisal). Anger has been repeatedly found to mediate the relationship between injustice appraisals and collective action. Recent work suggests that the emotion of being moved mediates the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Building on this prior work, the present research applies kama muta theory to further investigate the relationship between efficacy appraisals and collective action. Kama muta is a positive emotion that is evoked by a sudden intensification of communal sharing, and largely overlaps with the English concept being moved. We investigated its relationship with collective action in both advantaged and disadvantaged racial groups in the context of the Black Lives Matter Movement (BLM) in Spring of 2020. In one pilot study (N = 78) and one main study (N = 215), we confirmed that anger toward the system of racial inequalities mediated between injustice and collective action intentions, and that kama muta toward the movement mediated between collective efficacy and collective action intentions. Both mediations were found for both Black and White participants. We also observed additional unpredicted paths from anger to kama muta and from efficacy to anger. Together, this provides evidence for the pivotal role of emotions in collective action intentions, but also points out that appraisals need to be better understood.

AB  - The influence of different types of information sources on individual preventive behaviors remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between individual information usage to obtain information about COVID‐19 and compliance with preventive behaviors. This longitudinal study was based on an Internet survey conducted in August–September 2020 and February 2021. We used compliance with four preventive behaviors for COVID‐19, “wearing a mask,” “ventilation,” “social distancing,” and “avoiding crowds” as outcome variables, and 20 types of information sources based on people or institutions (Medical worker, Government, etc.) and media (TV news, Twitter, etc.) as predictors. Absolute differences and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using generalized estimating equations adjusted for possible confounders. Among the 18,151 participants aged 20–79, the mean age was 51.7 (SD = 15.9) in 2020, and 51.3% were male. In total, compliance with “wearing a mask,” “ventilation,” “social distancing,” and “avoiding crowds” was seen in 86.2%, 46.9%, 45.4%, and 62.6% of individuals in 2020, and 89.3%, 38.2%, 47.2%, and 61.6% of individuals in 2021, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, “medical workers,” “professionals,” “the government,” “Twitter,” “news websites,” and “TV news” were positively associated with compliance with two or more preventive behaviors (p < 0.05). The type of information source may play an important role in providing information for COVID‐19 prevention. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Under the enforcement of the recovery movement control order (RMCO), citizens of Malaysia were allowed to commute for work with tight protocols of social distancing. In this period of time, most individuals were adjusting to the new norm after being locked down for about six weeks. With an assumption that the social dynamics could have been different from the pre-pandemic era, this study aims to investigate how mattering predicts life satisfaction among individuals who live in the urban area of western Malaysia in the aforementioned timeframe. The role of other variables, namely perceived social support (PSS), resilience, and spirituality was also investigated. Data was collected from 402 adults between 18 and 66 years of age (M=25.44) who reside in the urban areas of Malaysia. A moderated serial mediation hypothesis was tested by employing the Bootstrap method in PROCESS Macro model 92. Our findings suggested that resilience does not play a significant role in the equation due to its insignificance in predicting life satisfaction after controlling the rest of the variables. © 2022, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama.

AB  - Background COVID-19 is a new pandemic that poses a threat to people globally. In Ethiopia, where classrooms are limited, students are at higher risk for COVID-19 unless they take consistent preventative actions. However, there is a lack of evidence in the study area regarding student compliance with COVID-19 preventive behavior (CPB) and its predictors. Objective This study aimed to assess CPB and its predictors among students based on the perspective of the Health Belief Model (HBM). Method and materials A school-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from November to December 2020 to evaluate the determinants of CPB among high school students using a self-administered structured questionnaire. 370 participants were selected using stratified simple random sampling. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data, and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses to evaluate the measurement and structural models proposed by the HBM and to identify associations between HBM variables. A T-value of > 1.96 with 95% CI and a P-value of < 0.05 were used to declare the statistical significance of path coefficients. Result A total of 370 students participated with a response rate of 92%. The median (interquartile range) age of the participants (51.9% females) was 18 (2) years. Only 97 (26.2%), 121 (32.7%), and 108 (29.2%) of the students had good practice in keeping physical distance, frequent hand washing, and facemask use respectively. The HBM explained 43% of the variance in CPB. Perceived barrier (β = - 0.15, p < 0.001) and self-efficacy (β = 0.51, p <0.001) were significant predictors of student compliance to CPB. Moreover, the measurement model demonstrated that the instrument had acceptable reliability and validity. Conclusion and recommendations COVID-19 prevention practice is quite low among students. HBM demonstrated adequate predictive utility in predicting CPBs among students, where perceived barriers and self-efficacy emerged as significant predictors of CPBs. According to the findings of this study, theory- based behavioral change interventions are urgently required for students to improve their prevention practice. Furthermore, these interventions will be effective if they are designed to remove barriers to CPBs and improve students' self-efficacy in taking preventive measures. © 2022 Shitu et al.

AB  - Objectives:This paper uses a social media platform, Reddit, to identify real-time experiences of people who use drugs during the COVID-19 lock-down.Methods:Reddit is a popular and growing social media platform, providing a large, publicly available dataset necessary for high performance of machine learning and topic modeling techniques. We used opioid-related "subreddits," communities where Reddit users engage in conversations about drug use, to examine COVID-19-related content of posts and comments from March to May 2020. This paper investigates the latent topics of users' posts/comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, an unsupervised machine learning approach that uncovers the thematic structure of a document collection. We also examine how topics changed over time.Results:The final dataset consists of 525 posts and 9284 comments, for a total of 9809-posts/comments (3756-posts/comments in r/opiates, 1641 in r/OpiatesRecovery, 1203 in r/suboxone, and 3209 in r/Methadone) among 2342 unique individuals. There were 5256-posts/comments in March; 3185 in April; and 1368 in May (until May 22). Topics that appeared most frequently in COVID-19-related discussions included medication for opioid use disorder experiences and access issues (22.6%), recovery (24.2%), and drug withdrawal (20.2%).Conclusions:During the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who use drugs were impacted in several ways, including forced or intentional withdrawal, confusion between withdrawal and COVID-19 symptoms, take-home medication for opioid use disorder issues, and barriers to recovery. As the pandemic progresses, providers and policymakers should consider these experiences among people who use drugs during the early stage of the pandemic. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Trust in information sources about COVID-19 may influence the public attitude toward the disease and the imposed restrictions, thus determining the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given country. Acknowledging an increase in trust in the government or the so-called rally ‘round the flag’ effect around the world at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explores possible determinants of this effect in Latvia, looking at such variables as the perceived disease risk, gender, age, education, income, and language spoken in the family. Presuming that risk perception may be amplified by trust in various information sources, we investigate a spill-over of the rally ‘round the flag’ effect on healthcare professionals, media, and interpersonal networks. Studying data from a nationally representative sociological survey conducted in September 2020, we confirm a positive relationship between trust in all information sources, except friends, relatives, and colleagues, and perceived disease risk. Correlations are also strong regarding trust in almost all information sources and the measured socio-demographic variables, except gender. Interpersonal trust seems to be relatively stable, and in most cases the correlations are statistically insignificant. With this study we suggest that increase in trust in government institutions as well as other information sources, even in crisis situations, does not depend on any single element, but instead presents a more complex phenomenon. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Individuals tend to dehumanize the outgroup. In this paper, we explore whether the activation of attachment security can attenuate dehumanization. Two studies were performed. In Study 1, attachment security was primed by showing pictures that depicted relationships with attachment figures; the outgroup was the homeless and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and non-uniquely human emotions to this group. In Study 2, the sense of interpersonal security was activated by inviting participants to relive a recent interaction that left them with a feeling of safety and warmth. Outgroup members were the Roma, and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and human nature traits to them. In Study 2, the mediation effect of intergroup emotions was investigated. In both studies, outgroup humanization effects were highlighted. In Study 2, these effects were mediated by increased empathy toward the outgroup. Interestingly, the positive impact of security activation was not moderated by chronic attachment orientations. Findings suggest strategies that can be used to improve intergroup relations in specific contexts and in society at large. © 2022 Capozza et al.

AB  - The Tour of Flanders, a classic outdoor cycling event that opens the cycling season, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a suitable replacement was created in its place, intended to offer people some solace during this lockdown period during which most recreational activities were suspended. This paper explains how the team managed to create an exciting mixed-reality (MR) racing event within a short period of time, given the limits of all social distance rules. It provides insights into how the real riders raced through a virtual landscape and how the viewers got to see this at home. This cloud-based production was performed exclusively with standard office IT equipment and well-known internet technologies. From idea to execution, the clock was ticking: the entire project was to be completed within a matter of days. © 2002 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, Inc.

AB  - In contrast to many other countries, robot-assisted (RA) pediatric surgery is not yet very common in Germany. Although the first pediatric RA intervention was published in 2001, RA pediatric surgery is still perceived as a “new technology”. As a consequence, little is known about parents’ perception of this operation method. In this study, we analyzed parents‘ intention to let their child undergo RA and laparoscopic (LA) surgery. Two subsamples (online and at the University Medical Center Goettingen) received a questionnaire addressing attitude towards RA and LA pediatric surgery with the help of a case example. Results showed that parents had a higher intention to consent to LA surgery. Perceiving more benefits, assuming a positive attitude of the social environment, and feeling less anxiety increased intention. A mediation analysis indicated that the type of surgery affected intentions through assumed attitude of the social environment. Exploratory analyses showed that the perception of risks and anxiety reduced intention for only RA surgery. These findings should be considered in preoperational discussions with parents. Anxiety and perceived risks should especially be addressed in order to encounter hesitancy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Eastern Massachusetts Life and Language project was in its planning stages when the COVID-19 pandemic began to make headway in the United States in 2020. We contribute to the conversation about conducting linguistic fieldwork during a major social upheaval by providing a description of our shift to virtual methodologies, which include utilizing Instagram for participant recruitment and Zoom for conducting sociolinguistic interviews. Virtual data collection remains underexplored, as there has never been a widespread need for such practices until the recent lockdowns resulting from the pandemic. Likewise, social media appears to be underutilized as a recruitment tool in linguistic fieldwork. Nevertheless, it is effective in producing a heterogeneous participant sample in a short amount of time. We are delighted to engage in discussions about the effects of virtual recruitment and data collection on linguistic fieldwork and the data itself. We offer a description of our pivots to virtual recruitment and interviewing and the racial justice initiatives that become achievable because of these changes. We hope this contribution is beneficial to researchers looking to incorporate virtual methodologies into their research program. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Aims: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not easy as there is no direct test that exists to establish such a diagnosis. Increasing community and healthcare professional knowledge of the ASD spectrum is crucial because it will encourage parents of ASD children to seek screening and diagnosis from a specialist, allowing for better early detection and treatment. This study explored the knowledge of the general population in Saudi Arabia regarding ASD and assessed variables associated with an accurate understanding of ASD. Methods: A total of 769 participants were involved in this cross-sectional study, which was conducted in Saudi Arabia between November 2021 and February 2022 using an online survey tool to explore the knowledge of the general population in Saudi Arabia regarding typical child development and ASD. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors affecting participants’ knowledge of autism. Results: Overall, the study participants showed a weak level of knowledge about autism with a mean score of 5.9 (SD: 3.1), comprising 34.7% of the total maximum obtainable score. Participants with a middle income category of 5000–7500 SR are less likely to be knowledgeable about autism compared to others (OR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.39–0.92)) (p-value = 0.020). Conclusion: The participants in our study showed limited knowledge about autism. Government funds should be made available to facilitate educational services for ASD children. More funding and resources should be allocated by the government to provide assistance for children with special needs, and changes in public facilities are required to meet the demands of ASD patients. Through an informed educational effort, various media platforms should assist in improving the community’s understanding of ASD and their attitude toward ASD patients. Educational campaigns should focus on enhancing the public’s knowledge about ASD treatment and etiology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Counter-empathy significantly affects people's social lives. Previous evidence indicates that the degree of counter-empathy can be either strong or weak. Strong counter-empathy easily occurs when empathizers are prejudiced against the targets of empathy (e.g. prejudice against outgroup members) and activates brain regions that are opposite to those activated by empathy. Weak counter-empathy may have different neural processing paths from strong ones, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we used an unfair distribution paradigm, which can reduce participants' prejudice against persons empathized with, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural mechanisms underlying counter-empathy. Here, empathy and counter-empathy shared a common neural mechanism, induced by unfair distribution, in the right middle temporal gyrus. Counter-empathy activated distinct brain regions that differed from those of empathic responses in different situations. The functions of these brain regions, which included the middle frontal, middle temporal and left medial superior gyri, were similar and mostly related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing. Here, we propose a process model of counter-empathy, involving two processing paths according to whether or not prejudice exists. This study has theoretical significance and broadens our understanding of the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying empathy and counter-empathy. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Within the context of Instagram celebrity-based brand endorsement, this study investigates the effects of parasocial interaction, perceived ad message authenticity, and the match-up between brand and celebrity. An online survey was administered to 253 college students taking introductory advertising or PR courses. Respondents, in return, received course credits. As hypothesized, study results reveal that parasocial interaction positively influences perceived ad message authenticity, the match-up between brand and celebrity, and attitude toward ads. In addition, perceived ad message authenticity and the match-up between brand and celebrity have a positive impact on consumers’ attitudes toward ads. The current study provides advertising practitioners with implications when it comes to creating advertising campaign messages and selecting celebrity endorsers. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Understanding the difference between the viewpoints of experts and the public and communicating are very important processes to prevent wasteful conflicts and achieve successful implementation of new policies. This study compares the structures of perceptions representing the views of experts and the public as subjects in research papers and newspaper articles of national education policy using semantic network analysis and overlay mapping. Data are collected from the Korean education system, where it is convenient to collect national-level educational policy data. The results show the group of education experts showed great interest in the core concepts of the revised curriculum and its implementation, focusing on abstract theories, whereas the public showed greater interest in practical problems and the outcomes of the revision rather than the process of revision of the curriculum. It clearly highlights the differences in and causes of the reactions of experts and the views of the public to newly developed national education policies, thereby presenting implications for the successful design of important national programs that include education policies for the future. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and business ethics are perceived as distinct constructs by the consumer, although research from this perspective is scarce. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the impact of CSR and business ethics on brand fidelity. A theoretical review of CSR, business ethics, brand attitude, brand love, and brand fidelity was undertaken. From these constructs, a theoretical model was proposed, conducting an empirical study with a sample of 559 North American respondents. Through the statistical treatment of data with PLS-SEM, it was demonstrated that business ethics and CSR exert an indirect positive effect on brand fidelity, with relationships mediated by brand love. In turn, brand attitude exerts an indirect effect on brand fidelity, through the mediation of brand love. Based on the results, this study contributes to the approach of CSR and business ethics as distinct constructs and to the consolidation of the brand fidelity construct and its relationships. For management, this study helps organizations to perceive CSR and business ethics as important allies in a brand’s strategy. We conclude that although CSR remains important, customers value business ethics as a critical factor in their perceptions of the brand, contributing more strongly to brand fidelity. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, affecting around 2.8 million people worldwide. Patients’ knowledge about COVID-19 infection, and their proper protective actions, may reduce the risk of infection. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of patients with MS about SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 illness, the relationship between MS and COVID-19, willingness to be vaccinated, and the impact of the pandemic on MS care. An original, anonymous, 35-items, self-reported questionnaire was used in both web-based and on-site survey formats. Two-hundred and forty-eight questionnaires were analyzed (mean age 40.8 ± 10.6 years, 77.8% women). Participants reported the use of multiple sources of information, and the most common were websites (77.8%) and television (59.3%). The majority of participants knew the correct symptoms of COVID-19 or transmission routes (94.4%), and accepted the pandemic’s restrictions (96.8%). A total of 93.2% considered SARS-CoV-2 as highly infectious, and 69% thought they were at higher risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, mainly because of immunodeficiency (82.7%). Although most of them were afraid of COVID-19 (69.0%), only two-thirds wanted to be vaccinated. Patients who were afraid of COVID-19 had a 3.5-times higher chance to declare willingness for vaccination. A total of 29.8% patients claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic limited access to the healthcare system. This study shows that Polish patients with MS represent a good level of knowledge about COVID-19 disease, and acceptance for public rules, but their willingness for vaccinations is not sufficient. Country-wide educational campaigns should be conducted, particularly on the internet and TV. Restrictions in healthcare facilities should be balanced to secure access for patients with MS. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This research investigated the mediating role of attitudes and perceptions between working from home (WFH) and employees’ job performance. It also explored the role of gender, education level, and job position in the relationship between specifications and facilities when working from home, as well as attitudes and perceptions. This study is exploratory and capitalizes on novel findings from a questionnaire. Data were collected from 399 employees employed by the principal Saudi businesses. The current study uses structural equation modeling to test the research hypotheses and examines the direct and indirect relationship between working from home and employees’ job performance. The results confirmed the significant direct linkage between WFH and employees’ job performance through the mediating roles of WFH employees’ attitudes and perceptions. Our findings also confirm the significant relationship between WFH employees’ attributes and their job performance, and the significant association between WFH and job performance. However, our results identified the fact that perceptions have an inverse impact on job performance. This study also provides significant theoretical and practical insights for managers who are adopting WFH. It contributes empirically to the literature by informing managers of the factors driving job performance in WFH, helping organizations to cope with the many issues related to a workforce who are working from home. Our research findings also ascertained that WFH seems likely to become a permanent managerial practice in terms of human resources, rather than a simple circumstantial measure. Moreover, this study can be considered as one of the first studies that assess the effect of WFH on employees’ job performance via a mediation role of employee attributes, in the context of Saudi firms. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As an emerging charity model, critical illness network crowdfunding provides a source of funds for some critically ill patients in China who have difficulty paying their high treatment costs by themselves. This study aims to investigate the influencing factors of the public’s willingness to donate to critical illness crowdfunding projects on Internet platforms. From a perspective combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, a complex and comprehensive structural equation model is proposed. We randomly selected 1,000 members of the public in China and empirically verified the study framework through structural equation modeling (SEM) based on 710 valid questionnaires. The results show that the public’s donation willingness and the social distance to a critical illness crowdfunding project on an online platform positively affect the public’s donation behavior, and donation attitude positively affect donation willingness; perceived usefulness and empathic concern positively affect the public’s donation attitude, which in turn affects its donation willingness. This study confirms that members of the public are more likely to help people who have similar demographic factors or people who are similar to themselves and have the same values, i.e., people who have a close social distance. It innovatively proposes and verifies the hypothesis that empathic concern can significantly positively affect users’ perceived usefulness and donation attitude. Strong empathic concern triggers donation willingness and behavior. © 2022 Chen et al.

AB  - Grounded in multidisciplinary literature from public relations, sport communication, and marketing, this study examined consumer reactions to sustainability initiatives launched by major sports leagues. Through an online survey (N = 254), the results showed that sports league-cause fit resulted in more positive organization–public relationships (OPRs) such as through trust, com-mitment, satisfaction, and control mutuality. Further, the findings revealed that a closer geographic proximity of the sustainability initiative and an increased perceived impact (donation amount and number of beneficiaries affected) triggered higher perceptions of trust, organizational authenticity, and fandom toward the sponsoring sports league. Interestingly, a significant two-way interaction between spatial proximity and impact suggested that lower perceptions of the impact of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) program evoked more positive attitudes when involving local beneficiaries, whereas higher perceptions of impact improved organizational attitudes when the beneficiaries were located faraway. Lastly, the findings indicated that the OPR variables, especially trust, as well as fandom, and organizational authenticity elicited higher supportive intentions (e.g., support CSR cause, donate, volunteer, share on social media) toward the sports league. Theoretical implications for fit, construal level theory, and CSR impact as well as implications for sport communication practitioners are discussed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed how people seeking to reduce opioid use access treatment services and navigate efforts to abstain from using opioids. Social distancing policies have drastically reduced access to many forms of social support, but they may have also upended some perceived barriers to reducing or abstaining from opioid use. Objective: This qualitative study aims to identify informal coping strategies for reducing and abstaining from opioid use among Reddit users who have posted in opioid-related subreddits at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We extracted data from 2 major opioid-related subreddits. Thematic data analysis was used to evaluate subreddit posts dated from March 5 to May 13, 2020, that referenced COVID-19 and opioid use, resulting in a final sample of 300 posts that were coded and analyzed. Results: Of the 300 subreddit posts, 100 (33.3%) discussed at least 1 type of informal coping strategy. Those strategies included psychological and behavioral coping skills, adoption of healthy habits, and use of substances to manage withdrawal symptoms. In addition, 12 (4%) subreddit posts explicitly mentioned using social distancing as an opportunity for cessation of or reduction in opioid use. Conclusions: Reddit discussion forums have provided a community for people to share strategies for reducing opioid use and support others during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future research needs to assess the impact of COVID-19 on opioid use behaviors, especially during periods of limited treatment access and isolation, as these can inform future efforts in curbing the opioid epidemic and other substance-related harms. © Josh Arshonsky, Noa Krawczyk, Amanda M Bunting, David Frank, Samuel R Friedman, Marie A Bragg.

AB  - COVID-19 severely impacted world health and, as a consequence of the measures implemented to stop the spread of the virus, also irreversibly damaged the world economy. Research shows that receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is the most successful measure to combat the virus and could also address its indirect consequences. However, vaccine hesitancy is growing worldwide and the WHO names this hesitancy as one of the top ten threats to global health. This study investigates the trend in positive attitudes towards vaccines across ten countries since a positive attitude is important. Furthermore, we investigate those variables related to having a positive attitude, as these factors could potentially increase the uptake of vaccines. We derive our text corpus from vaccine-related tweets, harvested in real-time from Twitter. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), we derive the sentiment and emotions contained in the tweets to construct daily time-series data. We analyse a panel dataset spanning both the Northern and Southern hemispheres from 1 February 2021 to 31 July 2021. To determine the relationship between several variables and the positive sentiment (attitude) towards vaccines, we run various models, including POLS, Panel Fixed Effects and Instrumental Variables estimations. Our results show that more information about vaccines’ safety and the expected side effects are needed to increase positive attitudes towards vaccines. Additionally, government procurement and the vaccine rollout should improve. Accessibility to the vaccine should be a priority, and a collective effort should be made to increase positive messaging about the vaccine, especially on social media. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the emotional challenges associated with vaccine uptake and inform policymakers, health workers, and stakeholders who communicate to the public during infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, the global fight against COVID-19 might be lost if the attitude towards vaccines is not improved. Copyright: © 2022 Greyling, Rossouw.

AB  - Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic warranted a myriad of government-ordered business closures across the USA in efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. This study aims to discover the implications of government-enforced health policies of reopening public businesses amidst the pandemic and its effect on county-level infection rates. Methods: Eighty-three US counties (n = 83) that reported at least 20 000 cases as of 4 November 2020 were selected for this study. The dates when businesses (restaurants, bars, retail, gyms, salons/barbers and public schools) partially and fully reopened, as well as infection rates on the 1st and 14th days following each businesses' reopening, were recorded. Regression analysis was conducted to deduce potential associations between the 14-day change in infection rate and mask usage frequency, median household income, population density and social distancing. Results: On average, infection rates rose significantly as businesses reopened. The average 14-day change in infection rate was higher for fully reopened businesses (infection rate = +0.100) compared to partially reopened businesses (infection rate = +0.0454). The P-value of the two distributions was 0.001692, indicating statistical significance (P < 0.01). Conclusion: This research provides insight into the transmission of COVID-19 and promotes evidence-driven policymaking for disease prevention and community health. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Consumer well-being often depends on compliance with service setting rules and product/service use guidelines. This issue came to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we propose and test a compliance model in the context of COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. Although COVID mitigation is politicized, we fully mediate the impact of political ideology with three constructs: (1) consumer perception that freedom is restricted, (2) complacency, and (3) perceived ethicality. We suggest specific tools that help bypass the political polarization that has occurred in the pandemic. The model can be applied to other areas in which compliance is key to consumer well-being, such as enforcing age-related restrictions on purchases and safety-related behaviors. © 2022 American Council on Consumer Interests.

AB  - Background: We investigated and compared practices and attitudes about childhood vaccination between young parents and their parents and identified influences and sources of information in the County of Zadar, Croatia. Methods: This research was conducted in six general practice and paediatric medical clinics. It included 300 volunteers, including 150 younger parents and 150 older grandparents. Information was collected with a survey questionnaire. The survey data were statistically processed. Results: The 300 participants were divided into 2 groups. Most of the respondents were married, employed, had a high school education, and had a good economic status, often with two children and living in the city. Generally, the attitude towards vaccination was positive. Healthcare workers made the most important influence on the decision for vaccination. The younger age group was significantly affected by social networks and the internet and wanted more information. They were afraid of the adjuvants in vaccines. The older respondents held that vaccination must be legally regulated and did not believe the anti-vaccine media headlines. Conclusions: Our respondents had positive attitudes towards childhood vaccination, noticed the benefits of vaccinating children, and held that untreated children represent a risk for the community. They were well informed and satisfied with the collaboration with medical professionals, although the media and social networks had some impact on attitudes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: During community-wide outbreaks, patients and their families may suffer from anxiety after making behavioral changes. This study aimed to investigate the anxiety, knowledge, and lived experiences of families with COVID-19 patients admitted to medical centers. Methods: The present multi-center study was conducted by a mixed method using convenient sampling in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Firoozgar and Rajaie Hospitals between May and July 2020. Anxiety was measured using a short form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The participants’ level of knowledge was assessed by an online questionnaire. The lived experiences of the families were explained through semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed by Chi square, ANOVA, independent-samples t test, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann–Whitney tests in SPSS 16. P values≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age of the 324 family members, who participated in the study was 45.1±13.3 years. The mean anxiety score of the subjects was 13.5±4.1, and 63.6% of the participants had moderate to severe anxiety. The subjects’ mean score for knowledge on COVID-19 was 7.15±1.32. The highest mean percentage of data received by the subjects on COVID-19 (42.7%) was obtained through radio and television broadcasting. A total of 251 important phrases were obtained from interview analysis and code extraction, out of which five main themes and 17 sub-themes were extracted. Conclusion: Our findings showed that anxiety was relatively high in families with COVID patients during the pandemic, and it was associated with age, sex, income, and familial relationships. The level of knowledge on the COVID-19 disease in families was moderate. Therefore, relevant interventions and raising people’s awareness are recommended. © 2022, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - During 2020–2021, the COVID-19 pandemics exacerbated the use of digital communication tools for the general population as well as for migrant and diasporic communities. Due to social distancing requirements, church activities had to be suspended or restricted, therefore, local congregations and denominations had to incorporate social media as part of their regular worship channels in an unprecedented way. At the same time, these new spaces opened an opportunity for diasporas to reconnect with their churches back home, and to participate in digital worship projects. In this paper, we study the case of the digital worship collective Adorando en Casa (AeC), which was started at the onset of the pandemics, producing several crowdsourced original musical compositions, uploaded in popular social media sites, and distributed via messaging apps. We focus on the reasons for participation of Venezuelan musicians and singers from different regions in the country, and from the large diaspora of Venezuelan Evangelicals. Additionally, we analyze the characteristics, structure, and theology of some of the songs recorded, to show how the concept of a digital diasporic spiritual consciousness is powerfully expressed through worship music. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated how sustainability-related messages of cotton textile and apparel products influence consumers’ attitudes toward the message and interaction with other consumers in social media. Three hundred and eighty-eight online survey data of US consumers investigated the effects of perceived information and emotion toward sustainability practice messages on attitude toward and social interaction with other consumers and the effects of attitude on social interaction in social media. The results confirm that emotion is an influential variable, and, specific, positive emotion is an influential variable for attitude, and attitude influences social interaction with other consumers of sustainability practice messages. Negative emotions influence both attitude and social interaction. The information does not influence attitude but directly impacts social interaction, which may bring the purchase intention of sustainable fashion products. Thus, apparel marketers should consider emotionally sustainable promotion messages when tailoring their brand communications on social media. This study helps clarify the relationships between emotion and social interaction for sustainable fashion products. It also contributes to the theoretical foundation and has implications for sustainable fashion marketing and management in social media. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Social distancing and mask-wearing were recommended and mandatory for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was disseminated through social media assessing mask type preference and COVID-19 history amongst tertiary sector services and the rates of the triad of respiratory symptoms in each mask type, along with other respiratory-related parameters. Results: Amongst 4107 participants, 63.4% of the responders, mainly women, preferred medical/surgical masks; 20.5%, mainly men, preferred cotton cloth masks; and 13.8% preferred FFP/(K)N95 masks. COVID-19 history was less common in FFP/(K)N95 compared to medical/surgical (9.2% vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) or cloth masks (9.2% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.006). Compared to the control group (rare mask-wearing, nonsmokers and without lung conditions), those wearing one medical mask were more likely to report frequent sputum production (4.4% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.026) and frequent cough (4.4% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.013), and those wearing FFP/(K)N95 masks were more likely to report frequent cough (4.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.048). Compared to the control group, those preferring cotton cloth masks were more likely to report a frequent cough (7.3% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.0002), sputum production (6.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.003) and dyspnea (8% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.00001). Conclusions: Safe mask-wearing should be in parallel with a more personalized and social interaction approach. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Ageism refers to stereotyping (how we think), prejudice (how we feel), and discrimination (how we act) against people based on their age. It is a serious public health issue that can negatively impact older people’s health and quality of life. The present protocol has several goals: (1) adapt the Ambivalent Ageism Scale for the general Portuguese population and healthcare professionals; (2) assess the factorial invariance of the questionnaire between general population vs. healthcare professionals; (3) evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in the general population and evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in healthcare professionals; (4) compare the levels of ageism between groups and the invariance between groups regarding the explanatory model of predictors of ageism. This quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study will be developed in partnership with several Healthcare Professional Boards/Associations, National Geriatrics and Gerontology Associations, and the Universities of the Third Age Network Association. The web-based survey will be conducted on a convenience sample recruited via various social media and institutional channels. The survey consists of three questionnaires: (1) Demographic data; (2) Ambivalent Ageism Scale; (3) Palmore-Neri and Cachioni questionnaire. The methodology of this study will include translation, pilot testing, semantic adjustment, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup analysis of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale. Data will be treated using International Business Machines Corporation (IBM®) Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the level of ageism in the study sample. The ageism levels between the two groups will be compared using the t-student test, and two Structural Equation Modeling will be developed to evaluate the predictors of ageism. Assessing ageism is necessary to allow healthcare professionals and policymakers to design and implement strategies to solve or reduce this issue. Findings from this study will generate knowledge relevant to healthcare and medical courses along with anti-ageism education for the Portuguese population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Innovative surveillance methods are needed to assess adherence to COVID-19 recommendations, especially methods that can provide near real-time or highly geographically targeted data. Use of location-based social media image data (eg, Instagram images) is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem. Objective: We seek to evaluate whether publicly available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence. Methods: We collected a sample of 43,487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11, 2020, from the following location hashtags: #Centralpark (n=20,937), #Brooklyn Bridge (n=14,875), and #Timesquare (n=7675). After manually reviewing images for accuracy, we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time, as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing (ie, whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others vs next to or touching each other). We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations. Results: We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions, with an approximate decline of 17% across each site (P<.001). We found a positive correlation between hashtags (#Centralpark and #Brooklynbridge: R=0.40; #BrooklynBridge and #Timesquare: R=0.41; and #Timesquare and #Centralpark: R=0.33; P<.001 for all correlations). The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Central Park (P=.004) and Brooklyn Bridge (P=.02) but not for Times Square (P=.16). Conclusions: Results suggest the potential of using location-based social media image data as a method for surveillance of COVID-19 health policy adherence. Future studies should further explore the implementation and ethical issues associated with this approach. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study is to characterize the use and efficiency of remote interpretation of visual fields (VFs) in an academic center and to determine how often the VF interpretation was consistent with the patient's clinical history and imaging at the time of the consult.Methods:This is a retrospective study at a single academic center that enrolled all patients receiving a remote interpretation of VF from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Data were collected regarding the referring department, indication for the VF, interpretation of the VF and comparison with any prior VFs, any associated interventions with the VF, and available follow-up VFs. The main outcome measures included 1) characterizing the use of remote VF interpretations and 2) how many remote VF interpretation results were consistent with the referring diagnosis based on the patient's clinical history and imaging.Results:One hundred eighty patients received remote interpretation of VFs. The most frequent referring departments were endocrinology (79; 44%), neurology (51; 28%), and neurosurgery (43; 24%). The VF indications included parasellar lesion (107; 59%), seizure disorder (26; 14%), meningioma (19; 11%), vascular lesion (11; 6%), and others (17; 9%). There were 78 patients (43%) that had an intervention before the VF, whereas 49 (27%) were preoperative VFs. Eighty-seven (48%) of the VFs were interpreted as abnormal. Of all the 180 remote interpretation of VFs, 156 (87%) had VF interpretations that were consistent with the clinical question posed by the referring provider based on clinical history and imaging. Among the other 24 remote VF interpretations (13% of total remote VF interpretations), there was no clear interpretation because of either additional unexpected VF defects (n = 5, 21%), VF defect mismatch (n = 6, 25%), or unreliable VFs (n = 13, 54%). The median wait time for patients receiving remote VF interpretations was 1 day.Conclusions:Remote interpretation of VFs was most often requested by endocrinology, neurology, and neurosurgery and could be performed very quickly. The most common indications were parasellar lesions, and just less than half of patients receiving remote VF interpretations had a prior intervention. A majority of remote VF interpretations were able to answer the clinical question, given the patient's clinical history and imaging. Remote interpretation of VFs may thus offer referring departments a more efficient method of obtaining VF interpretations than in-office neuro-ophthalmology examinations. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - We investigated the relationships between political beliefs regarding two aspects of the right-left distinction (cultural and economic) and the acceptance of the pandemic restrictions using variable-centred and person-centred approaches. The community sample consisted of 305 participants. Four groups of the restrictions were considered. Religious fundamentalism predicted positively the acceptance of the restrictions associated with the limitations of labour rights and those limiting civil rights without a direct impact on safety. Anti-welfare negatively predicted the acceptance of the restrictions regarding social distancing and those limiting civil rights and increasing safety. These associations were discussed in relation to basic needs and values which motivate persons who endorse right-wing or left-wing political views. The latent profile analysis revealed three profiles of political beliefs, which were termed "Conservative Statists,""Liberal Laissez-fairists,"and "Conservative Laissez-fairists."The profiles differed in terms of acceptance of the pandemic restrictions, and the patterns of these relationships were different for particular groups of restrictions. © 2022 Turska-Kawa, Pilch.

AB  - Purpose:To identify postpartum depression risk and describe experiences of women in the first 6 weeks after giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.Study Design and Methods:Using a convergent mixed-methods approach, we recruited a convenience sample of women living in the United States who gave birth March 1, 2020 or later from social media Web sites. Participants completed the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form and provided written answers to open-ended questions regarding their experiences at home with their new infant.Results:Our 262 participants were on average 32.6 years of age, the majority were White (82%), married or partnered (91.9%), and college educated (87.4%). Mean postpartum depression score was 17.7 (SD = 5.9) with 75% scoring ≥14, indicating significant postpartum depressive symptoms. Qualitative content analysis revealed five themes: Isolation and seclusion continue; Fear, anxiety, and stress filled the days; Grieving the loss of normal: It's just so sad; Complicated by postpartum depression: A dark time; and There is a silver lining. Quantitative and qualitative findings provided a holistic view of women's depressive symptoms and experiences at home with their infants during the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Implications:Although policies that reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection for patients and the health care team must continue to be implemented, the adverse effects of depressive symptoms on maternal-infant wellbeing within the context of increased isolation due to the pandemic need to be kept at the forefront. Nurses need to be aware of the consequences of women sheltering in place and social distancing on maternal-infant outcomes, particularly on depression and likelihood of breastfeeding. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The current study investigated how media exposure to a distant outgroup – asylum seekers in the European Union (EUAS) – may be associated with the transference of geographically distant foreign threats via Israeli media to Israeli local minorities. The study was based on an online survey of 1039 Israeli Jews. We found positive associations between frequency of exposure to negative EUAS media content and physical and symbolic threats domesticated from foreign outgroups to the local ground. Frequent exposure to negative EUAS media content was associated with worse attitudes toward asylum seekers in Israel. Thus, the media framing of remote groups and events can have important, long-lasting local consequences, including, most obviously, social and political implications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Dentists play a key role in the primary prevention of oral diseases and related systemic complications; therefore, their views on behavioural interventions need to be aligned with the current agendas for oral health. Likewise, dental students’ oral health-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours (KAB) are of practical importance, as they are the future opinion leaders for oral health in their respective communities. A cross-sectional survey-based study was designed to evaluate the oral health KAB of dental students in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The study utilized translated versions of the Hiroshima University Dental Behavioural Inventory (HU-DBI), and it aimed to recruit students from all Czech and Slovak dental schools. A total of 487 students were included in this study, out of which 372 (76.4%) were females, 271 (55.6%) were enrolled in preclinical years, 68 (14%) reported smoking tobacco at least once a week, and 430 (88.3%) reported problematic internet use. The mean HU-DBI score of Czech and Slovak dental students (8.18 ± 1.80) was comparable with the previously reported scores of dental students in Nordic and Western European countries. Czech students (9.34 ± 1.29) had a significantly higher score than their Slovak counterparts (7.56 ± 1.73). In both countries, preclinical students (8.04 vs. 8.35), the students who reported tobacco smoking (7.63 vs. 8.27), and those who reported problematic internet use (8.11 vs. 8.70) had significantly lower HU-DBI scores than their counterparts, respectively. In the Czech Republic, the significant increases in HU-DBI scores occurred after the first academic year when the students received preventive dentistry courses; therefore, one can put forward that early implementation of preventive elements in undergraduate dental curricula may yield better and more sustainable oral health gains for the students. Future research on Czech and Slovak dental curricula need to re-evaluate the oral hygiene and anti-smoking components and their impact on students’ views and attitudes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is defined as safe and effective for the general public to use, without seeking therapy from a health professional. As primary social media and internet users, university and college students are more likely to be exposed to unverified sources of health information. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of students at institutions of higher learning in Brunei with regard to the safe use of OTC medicines. A cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online questionnaire, adapted from the literature with additional information from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the educational resources in understanding OTC medicine for consumers. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections: demographic information, knowledge of OTC medicines, attitudes, and practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. A total of 335 students returned a completed questionnaire. The students had a mean knowledge score of 7.1 out of 9, with more than half (53.4%) having good knowledge (knowledge score > 7), and only a small percentage (5.7%) with poor knowledge. Almost all of the students (99.7%) had a positive attitude toward OTC medicine use. Few of the students practiced improper habits in terms of OTC medicine use, such as not reading the instructions or taking more than the recommended dose. Awareness of proper OTC medicine use among students in institutions of higher learning is necessary to prevent the rise of inappropriate user practices. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Physical inactivity is a common health problem in female college students, and factors such as weight self-stigma and smartphone addiction may negatively impact physical activity in this population. The aim of the current study was to investigate the associations between these variables and identify the moderating effects of smartphone addiction between weight stigma and physical activity. Using a cross-sectional study, information on the level of physical activity in the past week, weight-related self-stigma, and smartphone addiction, as well as demographics, were collected via an online survey from 391 female college students in Taiwan. Participants in two groups of moderate to high and low physical activity were compared using a zero-order bivariate correlation in terms of independent variables. A moderated mediation model using Model 14 in the Hayes’ PROCESS macro with 1000 bootstrapping resamples was applied to assess moderation effects. There were significant differences in terms of weight status, smartphone addiction, and weight stigma between active and inactive groups (p < 0.001). All independent variables except for age were positively correlated (0.14 < r < 0.45). Multivariate regression models indicated that weight status was associated with weight stigma (odds ratio [OR] = 9.13, p < 0.001; 95% CI = 6.90, 11.35). Weight status (OR = 0.47, p = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.23, 0.93), weight stigma (OR = 0.96, p = 0.03; 95% CI = 0.922, 0.997), and smartphone addiction (OR = 0.11, p = 0.003; 95% CI = 0.03, 0.47) were associated with physical activity. The moderating role of smartphone addiction on the association between weight stigma and physical activity was also identified (OR = 1.05, p = 0.049; 95% CI = 1.0001, 1.1004). The moderating effect of smartphone addiction on the association between weight stigma and physical activity suggests that designing interventions to address the negative impacts of both weight stigma and smartphone addiction may help to improve physical activity in female college students. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Several sociodemographic variables, including ethnic inequality, have been identified as potentially influencing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at least 70–85% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus post-vaccination. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and side effects were collected. Results: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25–34 years (38.6%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7% had received Covishield and 17.8% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1% have received both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9% had received only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated individuals had a gap of 4–5 weeks for the second dose (37.1%) followed by 5–6 weeks (11.2%). Post-vaccination 50.8% had experienced muscle pain, 46% had experienced fatigue, 36.5% weakness, and 12.3% back pain. Among vaccinated 26% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and 44.5% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the second time experienced either through vaccination or infection demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening complications. Conclusion: Although more than 50% of the vaccinated individuals experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high acceptance rate (74%) of vaccination among the participants. The vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to the non-vaccinated individuals. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Given that today's younger generation will face the future environmental consequences of ecologically harmful purchasing habits, it is necessary to understand how the youth inherit green purchase attitudes from the older generation. This study aimed to examine the intergenerational transmission of green purchase attitudes from parents to their adolescent children in a non-Western country, the Philippines. Moreover, this study sought to investigate the mediating role of adolescents' social responsibility in the link between Filipino parents' and their adolescent children's green purchase attitudes. Using 437 parent-adolescent dyads, our findings revealed that parents who endorse positive attitudes toward purchasing green products could influence their adolescent children's favorable attitudes in buying ecofriendly products via an increase in adolescents' social responsibility. Implications for parenting, education, and policy as channels to promote environmentally responsible purchasing in non-Western and developing nations such as the Philippines are discussed. © 2022 Mary Ann Liebert Inc.

AB  - William Randolph Hearst became editor and proprietor of the San Francisco Examiner in 1887, and by 1935, he had assembled a media empire consisting of nearly 30 major newspapers, 13 magazines, 8 radio stations, 3 news wires, and 2 motion picture companies. Most scholarship about Hearst has focused on his newspapers; less studied have been the magazines he acquired early in the 20th century. This monograph examines immigrant representations in Hearst magazines published between 1905 and 1945, focusing on how magazine fiction, nonfiction, and “fact-fiction” articles presented immigrants and immigration as social and political issues. Like Hearst himself, the publications favored immigrants from Germany and the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe and tended to disfavor those from China and Japan and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. According to the magazines, immigrants from the Far East and Mexico were “undesirables” who threatened society by, allegedly, importing, selling, and using hazardous drugs. Newspaper advertisements, news articles, and editorials extended these portrayals to wider audiences. Hearst also applied cross-media promotion to motion pictures, with writers converting fiction from his magazines into screenplays for Cosmopolitan Productions and MGM. The monograph contains examples of how magazine content and iconic covers have informed contemporary films and television series. In recent years, stylized representations have glamorized lifestyles but have also perpetuated cultural stereotypes that may contribute to anti-immigrant attitudes. © 2022 AEJMC.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information is available about the current practices of generalist speech-language pathologists (SLPs) in relation to their management of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). This study was designed to investigate four primary questions separately for the US and Canada; 1. What treatment approaches are used by SLP clinicians to treat CAS? 2. What treatment format and intensity are used to deliver CAS treatment? 3. What are the attitudes and perspectives of SLPs to evidence-based practice (EBP) as it pertains to CAS treatment? and 4. What are the perceived barriers to the implementation of EBP in CAS treatment? Method: An online questionnaire was used to investigate the four primary research questions. The questionnaire was distributed online through social media, some state-based associations and through forums affiliated with national speech-language-hearing associations. Results: Most survey respondents reported frequently using an eclectic approach to treat CAS (US 85%; Canada 89%). Although no intervention emerged as the most preferred primary treatment for CAS, US-based clinicians more commonly reported using the Kaufman Speech to Language Protocol (K-SLP) (33%) and Dynamic, Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) (28%); while clinicians in Canada used PROMPT ® (31%). SLPs demonstrated a positive attitude towards EBP however, they identified a range of perceived barriers that impacted their implementation of EBP. Conclusion: SLPs in the US and Canada frequently used an eclectic approach to treat CAS which is consistent with previous findings both in the CAS literature and the wider speech disorders literature. The more commonly used primary interventions were the K-SLP and DTTC (US); and PROMPT ® (Canada), with one of the strongest factors that influenced clinicians’ choice of intervention being familiarity with the treatment approach. Face to face therapy was preferred by clinicians across both countries, with clinicians in the US providing therapy between 2-5 times per week, while those in Canada delivered therapy up to once per week. Clinicians identified a number of barriers to implementing evidence-based practice, among which, being time poor was most commonly selected across clinicians in both the US and Canada. © 2022

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, digital strategies and decentralized approaches allowed for the continuation of weight loss clinical trials despite in-person engagement coming to a halt. In particular, trials leveraged remote mediums to measure data in real-time across a broad array of metrics while testing novel strategies to streamline patient care. Such approaches may address longstanding challenges with traditional trials, including attrition and underrepresentation of racial and ethnic minorities. Ultimately, emerging data from trials utilizing both digital and in-person strategies may indicate the promise of a hybrid approach in incorporating a robust virtual component for continuous patient monitoring and an in-person component for patient adherence and data standardization. In this commentary, we provide an overview of the most innovative digital approaches in clinical trials of weight loss during the COVID-19 era, as well as identify opportunities and challenges for these modes of research going forward. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Context: Public health officials and celebrities use social media to provide guidance to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Messages apply different promotional strategies to motivate behavior change, likely yielding divergent reactions from partisan audiences. The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) suggests that perceived threat for a negative outcome should impact perceived need for the advocated health behavior, which should be more appealing to an audience if perceived it to be efficacious and feasible. Objective: This study examines the interactive effects of Tweet source, message emotional appeal, and audience political affiliation on US adults' perceptions of COVID-19 threat and social distancing efficacy during early months of the pandemic. Design and Setting: This online survey experiment applies the EPPM to assess US adults' reactions to tweets encouraging social distancing. The experiment tests 3 emotional appeals (fear, humor, and neutral) and 2 sources (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and celebrity) on adults' emotional reactions and perceptions of COVID-19 threat and social distancing efficacy. Participants: The final sample included 415 US adults (242 Democrat and 173 Republican) recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Main Outcome Measures: Outcome measures were adapted from the EPPM and include perceived susceptibility to and severity of COVID-19, and response efficacy and self-efficacy regarding social distancing. Each was measured through the survey on a 7-point response scale. Results: Humor and fear appeal messages evoked less fear and guilt responses than a neutral tweet from the CDC. Fear and guilt emotions predicted greater perceived threat, while hope and pride predicted efficacy constructs in relationships moderated by political ideology. Conclusions: Public health messages targeting a bipartisan audience through social media may increase perceived threat by inducing fear of COVID-19 infection. EPPM theory suggests boosting efficacy is also critical to message acceptance and behavior change; thus, inducing feelings of hope and pride in addition to fear may be particularly effective.

AB  - Online reviews have gained momentum and continue to be the most influential source of information in consumers' hotel booking decisions in the tourism industry. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, construal level theory, and consideration of future consequences (CFC), this study contributes to the topic by claiming that consumers evaluate hotel reviews differently based upon their regulatory focus (i.e., promotion vs. prevention) and that this evaluation can vary according to contextual (i.e., temporal distance in booking time) and personal factors (i.e., temporal orientation). We found that temporal distance moderated the effect of regulatory-focused reviews on review attitudes when a booking was temporally distant; however, no moderating effect was found when a booking was about to be made. In addition, reviews' perceived relevance fully mediated regulatory-focused reviews' effect on review attitudes for the distant-future condition, but not the near-future condition. Finally, it was revealed that future-oriented consumers showed more positive attitudes when they read promotion-focused reviews (vs. prevention-focused reviews), but no significant differences were found among present-oriented consumers. This study's findings can help travel practitioners better understand consumers' hotel review evaluations and improve their marketing strategies. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of socio-political attitudes and motivational tendencies supposed to mark closed-mindedness, as well as other relevant variables of individual differences (Disintegration, i.e., proneness to psychotic-like experiences/behaviors and Death Anxiety), in the Militant Extremist Mindset (MEM). A community sample of 600 young respondents (Serbs, Bosniaks, and Albanians, aged 18–30) was recruited within a multiethnic region of Serbia that experienced armed conflict during the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The best-fitted SEM model, incorporating measurement and structural relationships between the variables, showed that the latent factor of Closed-mindedness predicted all three aspects of MEM as well as Neighborhood Grudge, that is, resentment toward neighboring ethnicities. The effects of Disintegration and Death Anxiety on MEM were entirely mediated by Closed-mindedness. Compared to previous findings, Closed-mindedness appears to represent the most important set of cognitive and motivational tendencies that channel protracted intergroup tensions into militant extremism. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - This study investigated the continuous intention to use digital payment solutions in online transactions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Primary data was collected from individuals using digital payment systems in Bangkok, Thailand using a structured questionnaire from a total of 400 respondents. The study adopted the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Data were analyzed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) in AMOS 26. The results revealed that factors that significantly affected continuous intention to use digital payments were perceived ease of use, satisfaction, attitude, and social distancing. Satisfaction mediated the effects of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and social distancing on continuous intention to use. Attitude mediated the effect of perceived usefulness on continuous intention to use. The study recommends that concerned policymakers and institutions should consider users’ satisfaction, social distancing, and perceived ease of use when developing digital payment systems. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

AB  - We currently seem to witness an increase of right-wing populism, anti-immigration sentiments, and a general hostility towards 'others' in increasingly diverse and complex societies. Based on literature in social, political and psychological sciences, we hypothesize that plurality resistance predicts negative intergroup relations by increasing stereotypes. Using data of a recent, large-scale, and representative survey (N = 2304; 55% females; MAge = 55,19 years), we examined, across different models, whether plurality resistance is associated with anti-Muslim attitudes, mediated via general and gendered Muslim stereotypes. Structural equation models provided evidence for the hypothesized main effect, which was partly mediated by stereotypes, while multigroup mediational models confirmed the robustness of the present findings. Results highlight the usefulness of plurality resistance that contributes to the explanation of negative intergroup relations as well as the important role of stereotypes as cognitive short-cuts for diversity-overwhelmed individuals in order to simplify and, thus, deal with the complexities of contemporary societies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The period between “liberalization,” or the 1991 opening of India's economy to foreign direct investment, and the 2008 onset of the Great Recession was one of unprecedented change in the forms of Indian art and the infrastructures that supported its understanding, presentation, and circulation. This period of efflorescence—of multiplying growth in and transformation of a set of interlocking artistic and social forms—poses methodological challenges similar to those identified by George E. Marcus and Fred R. Myers in their 1995 volume, The Traffic in Culture: Refiguring Art and Anthropology. Marcus and Myers’ call to focus on appropriation, boundary-making, and circulation, though meant to submit the Western art world to critique, coincides quite clearly with three particularly salient changes seen in Indian contemporary art in the period: the turn to unconventional material as artistic media (appropriation); the deliberate integration of artistic work with the materialities of everyday life (boundary); and the development of entirely new curatorial infrastructures and frameworks (circulation). The present essay examines these changes through Mumbai-based artist Navjot Altaf's post-1996, ongoing collaborative work with adivasi (indigenous) artists in the Central Indian region of Bastar. Eventually registered as the NGO Dialogue Interactive Artists Association (DIAA), the collective's activities have ranged from parallel exhibitions of “art” and “craft” to site-specific, cross-disciplinary engagements with play structures (Pilla Gudi) and water taps (Nalpar) built upon collective practices meant to bridge the considerable social distance between urban upper-class and adivasi artists. DIAA's work with water, like other artistic engagements with infrastructure, highlights the social, aesthetic, material, and political aspects of the built networks that sustain everyday life. Their critique leveraged Marcus and Myers’ ABCs, incorporating critical acts of appropriation, the active violation of social and geographical boundaries, and, above all, demonstration of a concern with circulation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Achieving the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as scheduled puts forward new demands for the green transition of low-carbon lifestyle in Chinese society. In-depth practice of green consumption (GC) behavior can effectively promote the supply-side and consumption-side emission reduction work, but the phenomenon of “high awareness, low practice” is widespread in GC. The causes of consumers' low practice of GC need to be analyzed from the perspective of time and space from the actual media data. Furthermore, this process assists policymakers and stakeholders to understand the general attitude of the public towards GC, clarifying the propagation path of public emotions and the source of negative emotions. Based on the data from Sina Weibo, this paper applied text mining, a hybrid model of convolutional neural network and long and short-term memory neural network to analyze the public's attention, sentiment tendency and hot topics on GC. The results show that the vast majority of the Chinese public has a positive attitude toward GC; women and economically developed regions are more concerned about GC; the drivers of positive public sentiment toward GC include environmental awareness education, air pollution prevention and control, and online shopping; high green product prices, excessive time costs, chaotic sharing economy and one-size-fits-all solutions lead to negative public sentiment toward GC. By providing public sentiment analysis of GC, this research would assist decision-makers to understand the dissemination mechanism of public will in social media and clarify targeted solutions, which is of great significance for policy formulation and improvement. © 2021

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of pandemic-related social distancing measures on existing health disparities among sexual and gender minority (SGM) young adults, including HIV transmission risk and intimate partner violence (IPV). Another concern was the potential for increased methamphetamine use during the pandemic, which is a known risk factor for HIV transmission and IPV. Methods: The present analysis examines the impact of COVID-19 social distancing (social distancing and quarantining) and methamphetamine use on HIV risk and IPV in a combined dataset from 3 cohort studies of SGM young adults (two in Los Angeles and one in Chicago) from May 2020 to April 2021 (n = 1142). Bivariate analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were estimated. Results: The median age was 26. All participants were assigned male at birth and most participants were men (93.8%). The largest racial groups were Hispanic/Latinx (44.6%) and Black (29.0%). In adjusted models methamphetamine use was consistently associated with having a new sex partner, higher numbers of sex partners, and experience of IPV, during the pandemic. Reporting no social distancing and reporting one social distancing behavior, were associated with experience of IPV relative to reporting 2 social distancing behaviors. Social distancing was not associated with sexual risk behavior or Pre-exposure Prophylaxis use. Conclusions: SGM young adults live at the intersection of multiple vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addiction services, HIV prevention services, and violence support services should be prepared to support young adult SGM needs, particularly those who use methamphetamine. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The pandemic related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a decrease in communicable diseases due to social distancing and mask-wearing. How have the prevalence of otitis media (OM) and its associated procedures changed during the pandemic? Study design: Retrospective Cohort Study. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System® (PHIS) database, which consists of 48 children's hospitals. Regions were defined according to PHIS rules. We compared proportion of OM to total diagnoses codes, and collected mastoiditis, and MT placements from all encounters through January 1, 2019-June 31, 2021. Results: In April 2020, there was a decrease in mean proportion of OM cases per 100 hospital visits (7 v. 2, p < 0.0001) and this was sustained through 2020 and until June 2021 (6–7 v. 2–4, p < 0.05; p < 0.05). Compared to 2020, the months of April and June 2021 showed an increase in mean proportion of OM cases (6–7 v. 3–4, p < 0.05) while May did not. This relative increase in OM cases through April–June were primarily driven by the South, the Midwest, and the Northeast in April and the South and the Midwest in June. MT procedures followed similar trends. In 2020, there was no difference in mastoiditis as a proportion of OM cases compared to 2019 however there was a statistically higher rate of mastoiditis in 2020 compared to 2021. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to declines in OM and MT case volumes that have started to increase. A geographic relationship may exist, and this connection could be influenced by mask mandates and social distancing. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Covid-19 pandemic has boosted digitalization in healthcare, as mobility restrictions and social distancing rules have made healthcare providers to adopt digital tools to replace or complement face-to-face interactions. Purpose: We discuss the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on physicians’ use of digital media. We examine whether Covid-19 conditions have changed how physicians use internet resources for information search, how they engage in social media, and their attitude towards online events. Basic procedures: The study was done as a longitudinal panel survey in four waves. The sample was a panel including active physicians in Finland. The panel was updated annually. Identical surveys were administered in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Spring 2020 was the time when Finland executed mobility restrictions and re-organization of healthcare because of pandemic. Comparing results of the survey before and after Covid-19 restrictions gives us a unique opportunity to do comparative analysis of Covid-19 effects. Main findings: Our results show that the use of digital media for information search stayed relatively stable without statistically significant change during the four-year period covered in the study. The use of social media rose steadily from 2018 to 2021 with no significant difference in the trend. However, there was a significant change in the attitude of Finnish physicians on online events. Year 2021, the attitude remained in this more positive level. Principal conclusions: As use of digital media including social media was already high prior Covid-19 in Finland, our results do not show significant change because of special circumstances introduced in 2020. However, our results show that the attitudes towards online events turned more positive during Covid-19 related restrictions. This could indicate that Covid-19 era has triggered a change that might continue also when pandemic related restrictions will be removed. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The article describes the results of teachers using a critical language lens to analyze linguistic stereotypes in TV series, movies, cartoons, and social media posts. I share the key questions teachers asked about language use in texts as well as the results of their analysis. Based in a cultural modeling pedagogy (Lee, 2007), teachers examined the texts of their everyday lives and increased their Critical Language Awareness. They identified linguistic tropes in nostalgic movies and TV shows, and uncovered patterns of associations between kinds of language use and kinds of people. Teachers emphasized the value of the activity for deepening their linguistic awareness and increasing a desire to disrupt linguistic prejudice. They developed multiple options for bringing a critical language lens to their own classrooms and students. © 2022 International Literacy Association.

AB  - Purpose: Long-term antipsychotic treatment is key to a positive clinical outcome in schizophrenia. Recent guidelines recommend the prescription of long-acting antipsychotic formulations (LAIs) as early as the first episode in patients with schizophrenia. The OPTIMUS study evaluated real-world use of a new three-monthly paliperidone palmitate formulation (PP3M) in France. Methods: For this observational cross-sectional study, all French psychiatrists were invited to enrol patients who had initiated PP3M in the previous 4 months. Snapshot data were collected at a routine consultation, without any modification of clinical practice. Results: This population of 350 patients with schizophrenia started on PP3M predominantly included single men, living independently with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for a median of 9.3 years. Demographic characteristics were broadly comparable to those reported in other studies on LAIs. Investigators cited treatment simplification (96.9%) and patient comfort (93.3%) as the most common reasons for switching to PP3M; enhancing adherence was mentioned less often (61.1%) with most patients previously considered as adherent, and a majority of them expressing a positive attitude to their treatment. One-third of patients accepted the psychiatrist's proposal to initiate PP3M treatment without any discussion, and relatives were involved in the therapeutic decision-making process in only 23.7% of cases. After initiation, few changes were seen in professional follow-up frequency or concomitant pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities except for a decrease in antipsychotic polytherapy. Conclusions: PP3M is mostly prescribed in adherent patients with fairly stable schizophrenia, and the longer dosing interval does not substantially affect patient care. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Working in positions that require being on-call can be overwhelming for some nurses, especially when beginning a new job. A learning curve will be experienced, which is greatly influenced by individual coping skills, comfort level with their nursing practice, the attitude of those around them (family, friends, co-workers), and their overall attitude about being on-call. Maintaining a positive attitude and making plans for the day of the call can make the difference between a shift filled with anxiety and misery or one filled with success at home and the bedside. © 2021 Association for Radiologic & Imaging Nursing

AB  - Background: Mass indoor gatherings were banned in early 2020 to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to assess, under controlled conditions, whether infection rates among attendees at a large, indoor gathering event would be similar to those in non-attendees, given implementation of a comprehensive prevention strategy including antigen-screening within 3 days, medical mask wearing, and optimised ventilation. Methods: The non-inferiority, prospective, open-label, randomised, controlled SPRING trial was done on attendees at a live indoor concert held in the Accor Arena on May 29, 2021 in Paris, France. Participants, aged 18–45 years, recruited via a dedicated website, had no comorbidities, COVID-19 symptoms, or recent case contact, and had had a negative rapid antigen diagnostic test within 3 days before the concert. Participants were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to the experimental group (attendees) or to the control group (non-attendees). The allocation sequence was computer-generated by means of permuted blocks of sizes three, six, or nine, with no stratification. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients who were SARS-CoV-2-positive by RT-PCR test on self-collected saliva 7 days post-gathering in the per-protocol population (non-inferiority margin <0·35%). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04872075. Findings: Between May 11 and 25, 2021, 18 845 individuals registered on the dedicated website, and 10 953 were randomly selected for a pre-enrolment on-site visit. Among 6968 who kept the appointment and were screened, 6678 participants were randomly assigned (4451 were assigned to be attendees and 2227 to be non-attendees; median age 28 years; 59% women); 88% (3917) of attendees and 87% (1947) of non-attendees complied with follow-up requirements. The day 7 RT-PCR was positive for eight of the 3917 attendees (observed incidence, 0·20%; 95% CI 0·09–0·40) and three of the 1947 non-attendees (0·15%; 0·03–0·45; absolute difference, 95% CI −0·26% to 0·28%), findings that met the non-inferiority criterion for the primary endpoint. Interpretation: Participation in a large, indoor, live gathering without physical distancing was not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2–transmission risk, provided a comprehensive preventive intervention was implemented.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward epilepsy among the final and semi-final years medical students at University of Bahri. Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was carried out at College of Medicine, University of Bahri. Self-administered questionnaires were applied to 228 medical students in the final and semi-final years. Results: Sixty-three percent of students showed a high level of knowledge. Despite that 10.1% of the students do not know that atonic seizure is a type of epilepsy, 62.7% attributed the causes of epilepsy to psychological factors only, and 9.6% considered epilepsy is an untreatable disease. The majority of students are not aware that screaming is a manifestation of certain types of epilepsy. More than half of the students considered inserting something into the patient's mouth during the seizure will prevent tongue biting. Interestingly, a total of 8.3% of students thought that it is a demonic attack, whereas 34.6% of students thought the Holy Quran as an appropriate treatment for epilepsy (P =.026). Up to 77% of the students showed a positive attitude toward patients with epilepsy. However, 42.1% of students agreed that there should be some restrictions in sport and leisure activities for people who suffer from epilepsy, and 13.6% of students admitted they will not get married to someone with epilepsy. Significance: Our study showed an overall relatively high level of knowledge toward epilepsy among medical students with a potentially positive attitude toward patients with the disease. However, there are still misconceptions of epilepsy in different aspects. This study showed some important facts for policymakers and key opinion leaders in curriculum preparation and training programs for medical schools which should be designed to increase knowledge and understanding of epilepsy among the medical students, not just the scientific knowledge but also discuss the social impact of epilepsy on a patient's life. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This study differentiates the roles of telepresence and transportation, the two widely cited processes underpinning an immersive media viewing experience, in the context of virtual marketing. In Study 1, college students viewed a real estate property tour in virtual reality (VR; high immersion) or as a 360° video (low immersion) in a research lab. The tour was accompanied by a voiceover presenting descriptive information about the apartment (descriptive evidence) or a narrative-based introduction (narrative evidence). We found the enhanced telepresence under the VR viewing condition negatively impacted users' memory of the property; this effect was particularly pronounced with the narrative voiceover. Study 2 replicated key findings from Study 1 in an online experiment with a larger and more diverse sample. We also found that narrative-induced transportation strengthened attitudinal outcomes, and enhanced telepresence boosted this effect. Our studies disentangle the impacts of VR-induced telepresence on cognitive processing from the effects of narrative-induced transportation on persuasive outcomes. The highly immersive media experience combined with deep transportation into the narrative can strengthen viewers' positive attitude towards the overall experience but hinder their ability to remember the details of the content. The findings point to a medium-message matching strategy to achieve marketing goals. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - In this research, we integrate social impact theory (SIT) and social cognitive theory (SCT) to examine how group ethical voice, as a form of social influence, reduces group abusive supervision. Drawing on SIT, we hypothesize that the strength of this relationship is contingent on the group's power, size, and social distance from the group leader (i.e., interaction frequency). Results from data collected over two time periods from 521 employees in 98 work groups (Study 1) reveal that group ethical voice reduces group abusive supervision, controlling for general group voice and group performance. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between group ethical voice and group abusive supervision was strongest when the group is larger, powerful, and interacts frequently with the group leader. These findings are replicated in Study 2, a time-lagged study of employees across three time periods. Study 2 also shows that the interactive effects of group ethical voice, group power, and social distance (but not group size) on abusive supervision are mediated by leader reflective moral attentiveness. Specifically, in powerful and socially proximal groups, group ethical voice reduces abusive supervision by fostering greater reflective moral attentiveness in group leaders. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous strategies have been proposed to allow for continued resident education while following social distancing guidelines. Diagnostic radiology is largely electronic work, allowing for relatively easy transition to telehealth. Our institution deployed home workstations to interested upper level radiology residents and fellows in order to maintain high volume workload and education, while complying with CDC social distancing and quarantine guidelines. Materials and Methods: We deployed 28 home workstations with integrated PACS, electronic health record, and reporting system, supporting workflow that matched our on-site processes and allowing residents to work from home while on diagnostic rotations. Two months into the pilot, surveys were sent to trainees and faculty to assess satisfaction related to education, productivity, and wellness. A retrospective study count was performed for a sample of residents in order to assess productivity. Results: Residents perceived their remote productivity as unchanged or better than at the hospital, while faculty were more likely to perceive it as decreased, however, objective results showed no difference. Education was largely considered worse or unchanged with very few regarding it as improved. Those utilizing shared-screen signout platforms rated education better than those utilizing voice/telephone communications only. Trainees expressed improvement in wellness and quality of life. Conclusion: Home workstations for trainees represent a feasible solution for implementing social distancing or even quarantine while maintaining operational productivity. There is the added benefit of scheduling flexibility, option to overcome space constraints, and improved quality of life. © 2021 The Association of University Radiologists

AB  - Objective: To assess prevalence and factors associated with depression, anxiety and stress among adolescents experiencing lockdown during the 2019 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in both Asian and Western countries. Material and Methods: From May-June 2020, secondary school students were enrolled in an online cross-sectional survey, through social media; including, but not limited to, Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp and LINE. We assessed the presence and severity of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7) and stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10) within the last month, and assessed significant associations with demographics, degree of social distancing, and other associated issues using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results: From 392 respondents (56.4% male, 43.1% female), from Thailand (59.2%), the United Kingdom (26.5%) and other countries (14.3%), we identified depressive symptoms in 58.7%, anxiety in 40.3% and high levels of stress in 9.7%. By multivariate analysis, we found significant associations between being female and depression and anxiety, being in late secondary school years and depression, and changes in patterns of substance use and anxiety and stress. Participants not located in Thailand had increased risk of depression. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated depression, anxiety and stress in six, four and one out of ten adolescents, respectively, who were experiencing lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found female gender, older school years, and changes in substance use patterns to be significantly associated with these mental health conditions. © 2021 JHSMR.

AB  - The Ghana National Single Window has become the focus of attention over its potential to move goods swiftly. However, since its inception in 2002, the controversies surrounding the implementation suggest issues beyond trade facilitation. The Information Systems literature primarily ascribes the controversies to resistance to technology. By adopting the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as a learning process for understanding port stakeholders' relations and attitudes, we explore the controversies to determine the meanings port stakeholders attribute to them. We combined SSM with interviews, media content analysis and focus groups made possible by snowballing. The responses were analyzed using rich pictures and validated through a conceptual model. The results reveal a fragmented government where ministries, agencies, and personalities assert power in single window implementation through I.T. vendor contracts. The situation results in a high cost of doing business at the port for shippers due to non-transparent and questionable contracts. The public's attitude towards the controversies reflects fears, hopes and expectations and legitimate concerns about important political and social goals. Using SSMs focus on relations and attitudes, we can document how controversies attributed to new technology is not a question of technology but of perceived political interference. © 2021 World Conference on Transport Research Society

AB  - Objectives: Patients at risk of anaphylaxis are required to always carry an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI), as the first line of treatment, but their adherence is low. An Emergency Response Community (ERC) is a social network of patients who can potentially help other patients who find themselves without their medication in an emergency. ERC can be mediated by an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency or unmediated to provide direct patient-to-patient immediate first aid. The purpose of this research was to study physicians' attitudes towards anaphylaxis ERC (AERC). Methods: A convenience sample of 224 physicians were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Answers were analyzed using ANOVA, t-tests and ordinal regression. Results: Positive attitudes towards an AERC found 88.4% (n = 198) see potential in the ERC and 62.9% (n = 141) think that ERC is excellent and should be implemented immediately. Fewer respondents (6.25%, n = 14) rejected the ERC completely. Respondents showed high willingness to provide patients with solicited or unsolicited advice to join an AERC (78%, n = 175 and 50%, n = 111 respectively). Physicians' opinion about the minimum age to join an AERC is an average of 15.45 years. Leading concerns are 'being left without AAI' (54.5%, n = 122), 'expired AAI' (44.2%, n = 99) and 'wrong AAI administration' (41.1%, n = 92). High support for mediated AERC (79%, n = 177) was found and mediation seems to reduce concerns among the majority (68.3%, n = 153) of respondents. Conclusions: Physicians expressed high support for unmediated AERC. EMS mediation is preferred by the respondents and potentially lowers their concerns. Findings support the AERC approach for patients at risk of anaphylaxis.

AB  - Background: The quality of communication and collaboration with colleagues, managers, and physicians affects the intention to leave a job and the profession for new graduate nurses (NGNs). New graduates have difficulties communicating and collaborating with physicians, especially. Aim: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the attitudes of nurse-physician collaboration and the levels of intention to leave the current job and professional commitment among NGNs. Methodology: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out with 231 NGNs in four private hospitals affiliated with an university. Data were collected by using a self-administered questionnaire, including a personal information form, the Jefferson Scale of Attitudes towards Physician-Nurse Collaboration, Intention to Leave Scale, and Nursing Professional Commitment Scale. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: NGNs had a high positive attitude towards nurse-physician collaboration with a median score of 49 (45–54). The professional commitment of NGNs was high level with a median score of 75 (69–86). The intention to leave the current job median score was 3 (2.3–3.6) out of 5. There was a statistically significant correlation between attitudes towards nurse-physician collaboration and the levels of intention to leave the current job (rs = −0.22; p &lt; 0.01) and professional commitment (rs = 0.42; p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: The results showed that improving NGNs' attitudes towards nurse-physician collaboration increases the professional commitment and reduces turnover intention. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Pest carp species are a problem around the world, particularly in Australia where European carp (Cyprinus carpio) account for up to 90% of fish biomass in several major river systems. The Australian National Carp Control Plan investigated the feasibility of using a biological control agent (Cyprinid herpesvirus 3; CyHV-3) to control carp. CyHV-3 is a naturally occurring strain of carp herpesvirus, found in numerous countries, but is exotic to Australia. This study reports outcomes of social risk assessment, measuring public acceptability of the viral biocontrol, societal norms and attitudes towards carp and carp control, emotional reactions towards the use of CyHV-3 to control carp, and perceived virus efficacy. Analyses identified a very strong partially mediated path model, explaining a high proportion of variance in the acceptance of CyHV-3 as a viral biocontrol (R2 =.83). The model showed a strong influence of attitudes towards CyHV-3 (e.g. whether people saw the virus as good, wise, pleasant, safe and positive), personal attitudes towards carp control, and social norms on acceptance, mediated by perceived virus efficacy (R2 =.77), emotional disturbance (R2 =.69), and perceived humaneness of the virus (R2 =.47). The strongest direct predictors of acceptance were perceived virus efficacy and social norms. These results provide important insights into drivers of social acceptability and social risk perspectives associated with novel biocontrol, assisting biosecurity practitioners in their planning and decision making for the introduction of potential biological interventions. © 2021, Crown.

AB  - In authoritarian regimes, without voting as a channel to gather public preferences, online public expression may become a major type of public opinion the government collects. However, online information can be biased and thereby mislead decision-makers. Combining data from a survey of judges and a national population survey, this article provides evidence that i) Chinese judges rely on online public opinion to infer public attitudes toward the death penalty, ii) online information is biased – online opinion is more punitive than the general public opinion, and, iii) biased online information seems to have a strong influence on judges’ perception of strong public support for the death penalty, and this may explain why Chinese scholars, lawyers, and other practitioners have persistently overestimated public punitiveness. The findings reveal a less discussed peril of the internet echo chamber: its misleading effect on the information collection process of the government, especially in autocracies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article views appraisal as co-selection patterns of target, source and evaluative parameters and investigates the ways in which news discourse retells news stories and reproduces truthful reality. We combined the corpus-assisted method and quantitative/qualitative analysis of the data, i.e., 904 sentences which were extracted from the corpus of German 5G news reports by selecting the top 5 items from each of the noun keywords lists of the three subcorpora of economics, politics and technology news reports. It was found that the German media restage the necessity and desirability to promote the development of German communication facilities/technology through international cooperation, particularly Germany-Sino cooperation. In addition, a hesitant image was evoked as to the high-profile 5G development in Germany with an awareness of the potential security risks and economic losses. On the intersubjective dimension, our findings suggest that journalists make full exploitation of different dialogistic positioning strategies for closing down or opening up the dialogic space to a greater or lesser degree. More specifically, they tend to acknowledge and endorse the positive/negative attitudes attributed to the non-authorial voices towards particular targets in the fields of economics, politics or technology. A future comparison with the genre of news comments or editorials would deepen our understanding of the performativity of media. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Background and Objectives: There are reports of outcomes of elective major cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated if reinforcement of hand hygiene, universal masking, and distancing as a part of pandemic precautions led to a decrease in the incidence of surgical site infections (SSIs) in major oncologic resections. Methods: Propensity score matching using the nearest neighbor algorithm was performed on 3123 patients over seven covariates (age, comorbidities, surgery duration, prior treatment, disease stage, reconstruction, and surgical wound type) yielding 2614 matched (pre-COVID 1612 and COVID 1002) patients. Conditional logistic regression was used to identify if SSI incidence was lower amongst patients operated during the pandemic. Results: There was a 4.2% (p = 0.006) decrease in SSI in patients operated during the pandemic. On multivariate regression, surgery during the COVID-19 period (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.61–0.98; p = 0.03), prior chemoradiation (OR = 2.46; CI = 1.45–4.17; p < 0.001), duration of surgery >4 h (OR = 2.17; 95%CI = 1.55–3.05; p < 0.001) and clean contaminated wounds (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.09–2.18; p = 0.012) were significantly associated with SSI. Conclusion: Increased compliance with hand hygiene, near-universal mask usage, and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic possibly led to a 23% decreased odds of SSI in major oncologic resections. Extending these low-cost interventions in the post-pandemic era can decrease morbidity associated with SSI in cancer surgery. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - COVID-19 has been spreading fast worldwide, and until effective and safe vaccines have been widely adopted, preventive measures such as social distancing are crucial to keep the pandemic under control. The study’s research questions asked which psychosocial factors predict social distancing behavior and whether there are country-level differences in social distancing? Using the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) as a theoretical lens, we examined the predictive effects of threat and efficacy and demographic variables on adherence to the COVID-19 preventive behavior of social distancing using a survey among an international sample of university students. Using path modeling and analysis of covariance, we confirmed the predictive effects of the EPPM on social distancing behavior. Our final model showed that perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 was both directly and indirectly (through response efficacy) associated with social distancing behavior; that perceived severity of COVID-19 yielded a significant indirect effect on social distancing behavior through both self-efficacy and response efficacy; that perceived susceptibility is indirectly and positively associated with social distancing behavior through response efficacy; and that self-efficacy and response efficacy were directly associated with social distancing behavior. Additionally, there were country-level differences in social distancing. Possible explanations for and implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: The causes of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception are unknown, with infection as the most likely culprit. Recently, social distancing measures were implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to decrease transmissible infectious diseases, creating an opportune setting to study the role of infection on the pathogenesis of intussusception on a population level. Objective: To investigate the impact of social distancing on intussusception. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed air contrast enemas and pylorus ultrasounds performed between March 2010 and March 2021 to identify cases of ileocolic intussusception and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), using the latter as a negative control. The study time frame was divided into two periods: pre-pandemic (March 2010–February 2020) and pandemic (April 2020–March 2021). The number of cases that occurred in these two time periods were compared using the Poisson regression model. Results: Of the 407 cases of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception identified, 396 occurred in the pre-pandemic time period (mean = 39.6 per 12-month period) and 11 occurred in the 12-month pandemic time period. The mean monthly number of intussusceptions showed a decline of 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49–85%) between the pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods (3.3 vs. 0.9 monthly cases; P < 0.001). In contrast, the mean monthly number of HPS did not differ significantly (P = 0.19). Conclusion: Social distancing—imposed to curb the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic—resulted in a significant decline in ileocolic intussusception, lending strong support to the theory that infection is the dominant cause of intussusception. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - We investigate, using concepts from social psychological theories of the determinants of environmental behavior that might be affected by video media, the impact of viewing a short YouTube video about waste reduction while controlling for pre-existing environmental attitudes and beliefs, which is the greatest challenge in evaluating the impact of video media. The experimental design splits respondents approximately evenly between those who viewed the video and those who viewed just a text summarizing the points made in the video. Comparing results for the two subsamples is a way of identifying the impact of the video itself. For the sample as a whole, the video seemed to affect some beliefs and norms more than did the text alone. But for many measures of attitudes and intended behavior, there was no difference between the video and text samples, and sometimes neither sample had a significant change. We present suggestive evidence, though, that both video and text treatments have stronger effects on people who were not already strongly pro-environmental before the experimental treatment. © 2021, AESS.

AB  - What mitigates the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants? Addressing this question, we explored how national identification, endorsing binding moral foundations and the perception of threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants in Malta. It was hypothesized that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more prone to identify with being Maltese and more probable to endorse binding moral foundations and perceive high threat from migrants, leading to a more prejudiced attitude towards migrants living in Malta. Two hundred and twenty-two individuals participated in this quantitative study. Results from this study showed that national identification, binding moral foundations and perceived threat mediate the relationship between need for cognitive closure and prejudice against migrants. The implications of the findings for theories about how need for cognitive closure contributes to increased prejudiced attitude in native population is discussed.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in the world and the mortality rate is getting higher and higher. Due to the outbreak of such epidemic disease, many countries imposed stricter measures among which is social distancing and enforced isolation. The present study tries to establish a realistic model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures. In so doing, it takes into account stochastic perturbation and investigates the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics. This paper seeks to study the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution to the proposed model and establish conditions for extinction and persistence in mean of the disease. Numerical simulations are presented to show the theoretical results obtained from this study. © 2021, Forum D'Analystes, Chennai.

AB  - Purpose: Radiology departments around the world have been faced with the challenge to adapt, and recover to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic. Methods: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability. Results: Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities. Conclusion: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Although prior research has explored the demographic characteristics, religious practices, and beliefs of modern Pagans, their political attitudes and actions have yet to be studied in depth. Further, most extant research is based on non-random samples of Pagans which calls into question the generalizability of prior findings. This article examines Pagans' political attitudes and behavior using a representative sample of Pagans in the United States drawn from the 2014 Pew Religious Landscape Study. Descriptive and multivariate analyses show that Pagan religious identity shapes political views and behavior despite the varied and decentralized nature of Paganism. Overall, Pagans are relatively liberal and supportive of issues common across Pagan traditions like the environment and LGBTQ rights. However, Pagans are somewhat less politically engaged than non-Pagans as evidenced by their lower levels of party identity and voter registration. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The article investigates news coverage and media framing of the Syrian refugee debate as a public opinion issue in US local news in 2015. The sheer number of refugees created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as millions of civilians settled in neighboring countries, and a significant number of them embarked on a perilous journey to seek refuge in European countries. The political response to the Syrian refugee crisis was divided, but public attitudes shifted after the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015 with calls for more restrictive immigration policies and smaller refugee quotas. In the US, GOP leaders demanded “extreme vetting” and “screening” of refugees and many opposed resettling the modest number of refugees the Obama administration promised to let in. The study analyzes local news coverage variation across the States that welcomed, not welcomed or did not commit to accepting Syrian refugees at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. The findings of the study demonstrate that the editorial framing of the Syrian refugee crisis downplayed the global responsibility and international commitment of the US, highlighted the administrative costs and framed them as security threats. The implications of these frames are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study examined Israeli public perceptions of institutional child sexual abuse (CSA) in the Malka Leifer case. Leifer is a Jewish ultra-Orthodox former Melbourne school principal who is wanted in Australia on CSA charges, after fleeing to Israel. Based on a qualitative analysis of 2,451 reader comments retrieved from four Israeli news websites and six public Facebook pages, the findings indicated diverse attitudes toward the alleged perpetrator, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, state authorities, and victims. All parties involved were criticized, but less so the victims. Criticisms included sociopolitical and gender stereotypes, and demonic attributions. Positive comments were directed at all involved, even the alleged perpetrator, and especially the victims. The results demonstrate the need to better understand CSA portrayals in cyberspace, as they affect both public and policymaker attitudes, and the importance of fighting prejudicial discourse about the ultra-Orthodox community, especially in light of its changing attitudes regarding CSA. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about how sheltering in place to contain the spread of COVID-19 over extended periods affects individuals’ psychological well-being. This study’s objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM’s (men who have sex with men) low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted online across Brazil (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling and Facebook posts. Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and the respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results: The prevalence of low psychological well-being found in the sample was 7.9%. Associated factors were belonging to the youngest group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90–4.01), having polyamorous relationships (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51–5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42–8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06–2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04–3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44–4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23–2.69) Conclusion: The well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. The variables that contributed the most to this outcome include social isolation, relationships established with partners, and sexual behavior. Policy Implications: Planning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM’s resilience by adopting safe strategies and behavior. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Media representations have significant power to shape opinions and influence public response to communities or groups around the world. This study investigates media representations of Islam and Muslims in the American media, drawing upon an analysis of reports in the New York Times over a 17-year period (from Jan.1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2016) within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. It examines how Islam and Muslims are represented in media coverage and how discursive power is penetrated step by step through such media representations. Most important, it investigates whether Islam and Muslims have been stigmatized through stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. The findings reveal that the New York Times’ representations of Islam and Muslims are negative and stereotypical: Islam is stereotyped as the unacclimatized outsider and the turmoil maker and Muslims as the negative receiver. The stereotypes contribute to people’s prejudice, such as Islamophobia from the “us” group and fear of the “them” group but do not support a strong conclusion of discrimination. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices (KAP) among the garment factory worker population in Bangladesh regarding a historical dengue outbreak in 2019. A total of 400 participants were selected by simple random sampling, and questionnaire-based interviews were conducted. The average score of knowledge, attitude and prevention practice was 8.33 ± 2.35, 6.32 ± 1.20 and 6.31 ± 1.50, respectively. Only 76 out of 400 participants (19%) scored above 10 (all university-educated). Participant workers reported both negative and positive attitudes regarding dengue fever (DF). Negative attitudes included an expectation of increased mortality and strained family finances from DF attacks. A significantly high number of participants (92%) believed that death from DF was inevitable. Positive attitudes included optimism about DF eradication potentials and eagerness to help and donate blood to sick relatives. Participants primarily learned about the DF prevention from mass media (244/400; 61.0%) and social media (97/400; 24.25%). The most popular prevention measures adopted were mosquito repellent incense (344/400; 86.0%) and mosquito nets (389/400; 97.25%). While most participants (358/400; 89.5%) cleaned areas where mosquitos lay eggs, only 169 out of 400 (42.25%) regularly treated with chemical sprays. Only 182 out of 400 (45.5%) reported receiving DF prevention training in the factory. Correlation between DF knowledge and education was statistically significant (r =.38, p <.01, n = 398). Correlation between DF knowledge and work experience was insignificant (r =.01, p >.01, n = 398). Age and DF knowledge were not correlated (r = 0.07, p >.01, n = 398). In conclusion, gaps in KAP for dengue could be addressed by government-sponsored educational programmes that utilize the power of mass/social media for dengue prevention and control. More KAP surveillance studies are needed for other sectors of the society. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine weight stigma experiences during medical visits as related to provider-patient relationship factors and adherence among individuals with hypothyroidism. A total of 362 participants recruited via social media participated in an online survey. Regression and mediation analyses indicated that weight stigma was negatively associated with adherence; this relationship was mediated by decreased trust in provider, less perceived provider empathy, and lower provider-patient depth-of-relationship. Structural equation modeling with BMI controlled revealed that weight stigma is associated with worsened provider-patient relationship and adherence. Findings suggest the importance of eliminating weight stigma experiences for patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Low/no-income Latino men are disproportionately burdened by chronic disease morbidity and mortality, which is often compounded by persistent exposure to stress. Chronic stress is a key mediating factor in pathways linking macro-level socio-structural forces to micro-level behavioral factors with negative health outcomes. Being that Latinxs continue to be one of the fastest growing populations in the U.S., it is imperative to better understand the roots of stress pathways and explore multi-level interventions. Methods: This study presents qualitative findings from in-depth interviews with Puerto Rican men (95%) living in Springfield, Massachusetts. We utilized the Minority Stress Model (MSM) first posited by Ilan Meyers, as a framework to understand stress and stress processes amongst Puerto Rican men. We mapped our data onto Meyers' MSM, which allowed us to find diverging themes and identify areas for expansion. Results: As expected, participants reported stress rooted in experiences of racism and prejudice, expectations of rejection, English-language acquisition, family relationships, insecure housing, precarious employment, and lack of resources. Nevertheless, the MSM did not account for the historical contexts that, as our findings indicate, are used to filter and understand their experiences with everyday stressors. Participants described and linked histories of colonial violence and movement and migration to their stress and community wellbeing. Discussion: Findings suggest the need to expand the current MSM and our conceptualization of the stress process to include historical understandings when contextualizing present-day stress and future interventions. We propose an expanded heuristic model that delineates the impact of distinctive historical trajectories that aid in interpreting racial health disparities amongst minoritized populations. Future multi-level interventions should give weight to highlighting history and how this impacts the present, in this case including the culpability of U.S. policy regarding Puerto Rico and the adverse health effects for Puerto Rican men on the mainland.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of dairy farmers about climate change in dairy farms in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted following a cross-sectional research design (Bryman, 2012). The study was conducted mainly on dairy farms located on the south-eastern part of the Eastern Cape province in five districts out of the province’s six districts (Figure 1). These districts include Amathole, Chris Hani, OR Tambo and Cacadu; these regions were not included in a recent surveying study (Galloway et al., 2018). Findings: In all, 71.7% of dairy farm workers heard about climate change from the television, and 60.4% of participants reported that they gathered information from radio. Eighty-two out of 106 (77.4%) correctly indicated that climate change is a significant long-term change in expected weather patterns over time, and almost 10% of the study participants had no clue about climate change. Approximately 63% of the respondents incorrectly referred to climate change as a mere hotness or coldness of the day, whereas the remainder of participants correctly refuted that definition of climate change. Most of the study participants correctly mentioned that climate change has an influence on dairy production (92.5%), it limits the dairy cows’ productivity (69.8%) and that dry matter intake of dairy cows is reduced under higher temperatures (75.5%). Research limitations/implications: The use of questionnaire to gather data limits the study, as respondents relied on recall information. Also, the sample size and study area limits use of the study as an inference for the excluded parts of the Eastern Cape Province. Also, it focused only on dairy farm workers and did not request information from beef farmers. Practical implications: This study imply that farmers without adequate knowledge of the impact of climate change keep complaining of a poor yield/ animal productivity and changing pattern of livestock diseases. Hence, a study such as the present one helps to bridge that gap and provide relevant governing authority the needed evidence for policy changes and intervention. Social implications: Farmers will begin to get help from the government regarding climate change. Originality/value: This a first study in South Africa seeking to document the knowledge of dairy farm workers about climate change and its impacts on productivity. © 2021, Yanga Simamkele Diniso, Leocadia Zhou and Ishmael Festus Jaja.

AB  - Objectives: Cervical cancer is 99.8% preventable when detected early; however, uptake of screening in the United Kingdom is at a 20-year low. Recently, a number of social media influencers have video logged about their experiences of cervical screening through narrative communication with their audience. Here we aimed to explore if accessing cervical screening information from a social media influencer can impact the theory of planned behaviour variables and predict intention to attend cervical screening appointments. Design: Utilising a cross-sectional design a volunteer sample of 102 UK women (mean age = 28; SD = 3.10; range = 25–35) took part in an online questionnaire study. Results: Hierarchical regression modelling revealed attitude as a significant predictor of intention to attend a cervical screening appointment and that social media influencers affect attitudes of their audience, indirectly influencing intention to attend. Conclusion: Health messages communicated by social media influencers are effective in promoting positive attitudes but not directly influence intention to attend towards cervical screening. Further research should explore influencer impact on attitudes towards this health behaviour with the ultimate aim of increasing attendance and consequently saving lives. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to propose a research framework to examine the effects of consumer consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle on the attitudes toward eating “green” simultaneously in a single study. Besides, the mediating role of healthy lifestyle in forming a positive attitude toward eating “green” is also examined in this study. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based approach was applied in this study. The unit of analysis was individual consumer (aged 18 years and above) who lived in Klang Valley, Malaysia. PLS-SEM was used to test the structural relationship of the constructs in the model based on the 300 useable data collected. Findings: The results indicated that health consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle have a significant effect on attitudes toward eating “green”, whereas environmental and price consciousness did not have such effect. A healthy lifestyle also mediates the relationship between health consciousness and attitude toward eating “green”. An individual’s healthy lifestyle that focused on physical health-related activities will increase the effect of consumer health consciousness on their attitudes toward eating “green”. Practical implications: The outcome of this study provided deeper insights for firms to assess the feasibility of entering or expanding their operations in the green market with more enduring and effective sales and marketing strategies. Originality/value: Consumers’ acceptance of or resistance toward organic food had become the centre of the research focus by the academician and the industrial practitioners over the years, despite the inconsistencies of the results obtained to predict such behavior. In this study, besides examining the direct effect of the proposed variables on the attitudes toward eating “green”, the mediating role of a healthy lifestyle in forming such attitudes was also examined. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore topics and sentiments using tweets from Ontario, Canada, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Tweets were collected from December 5, 2020, to March 6, 2021, excluding non-individual accounts. Dates of vaccine-related events and policy changes were collected from public health units in Ontario. The daily number of COVID-19 cases was retrieved from the Ontario provincial government’s public health database. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for unsupervised topic modelling. VADER was used to calculate daily and average sentiment compound scores for topics identified. Results: Vaccine, pandemic, business, lockdown, mask, and Ontario were six topics identified from the unsupervised topic modelling. The average sentiment compound score for each topic appeared to be slightly positive, yet the daily sentiment compound scores varied greatly between positive and negative emotions for each topic. Conclusion: Our study results have shown a slightly positive sentiment on average during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, along with six topics. Our research has also demonstrated a social listening approach to identify what the public sentiments and opinions are in a timely manner. Copyright © 2022 Tsao, MacLean, Chen, Li, Yang and Butt.

AB  - Importance: In 2018 to 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo experienced the world's second largest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak, killing 2290 individuals; women were disproportionately infected (57% of all cases) despite no evidence of differential biological EVD risk. Understanding how gender norms may influence exposure to EVD, intensity, and prognosis as well as personal protective behaviors against the virus is important to disease risk reduction and control interventions. Objective: To assess whether men and women differ in personal protective behaviors (vaccine acceptance, health-seeking behaviors, physical distancing) and the mediating role of EVD information and knowledge, perceived disease risk, and social relations. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional, multistage cluster survey study of 1395 randomly selected adults was conducted in the Ebola-affected regions of North Kivu from April 20, 2019, to May 10, 2019. Path analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling to examine associations among study variables. Statistical analysis was conducted from August 2019 to May 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main behavioral outcomes of interest were (1) vaccine acceptance, (2) formal health care seeking, and (3) self-protective behaviors. The primary factor of interest was self-reported gender identity. We also assessed sociodemographic factors. Results: Among the study's 1395 participants, 1286 (93%) had Nande ethnicity and 698 (50%) were women; the mean (SD) age was 34.5 (13.1) years. Compared with female participants, male participants reported significantly higher levels of education, wealth, and mobile phone access. There were associations found between gender and all EVD preventive behavioral outcomes, with evidence for mediation through EVD knowledge and belief in rumors. Men reported greater EVD knowledge accuracy compared with women (mean [SE] score for men: 12.06 [0.13] vs women: 11.08 [0.16]; P <.001), and greater knowledge accuracy was associated with increases in vaccine acceptance (β = 0.37; P <.001), formal care seeking (β = 0.39; P <.001), and self-protective behaviors (β = 0.35; P <.001). Lower belief in rumors was associated with greater vaccine acceptance (β = -0.30; P <.001), and greater EVD information awareness was associated with increased adoption of self-protective behaviors (β = 0.23; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found gender differences in adopting preventive protective behaviors against EVD. These findings suggest that it is critical to design gender-sensitive communication and vaccination strategies, while engaging women and their community as a whole in any response to infectious disease outbreaks. Research on the potential link between gender and sociodemographics factors associated with disease risk and outcomes is needed.. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives Handwashing is known as the most preventive method for various infectious diseases. Health authorities have conducted various campaigns and public relations targeting the general population but few evaluations of these long-term interventions. This study aimed to investigate the association between experience of educational events or public relations (EXEP), attitude towards the effectiveness of handwashing (AEHW) and handwashing practice (HWP). Setting Using a population-based cross-sectional study with a complex sample design, we explored the response outcomes of handwashing. Those outcomes were collected biennially using Community Health Survey among the years 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. We applied multivariate logistic regression for the association among sociodemographic factors, health conditions, EXEP, AEHW and HWP. Participants Total participants residing in Seoul were 23 139 (men 44.2%), 23 004 (men 44.4%), 22 955 (men 44.8%) and 22 930 (men 43.9%), in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Results Overall, participants with EXEP are more likely to be women, aged between the 30s and 60s, and with a higher educational level. Particularly, participants with EXEP had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.33) and AEHW (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.63). In addition, AEHW also had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.81). The mediated effect of AEHW to HWP is not determined evidently. Conclusion The results showed that EXEP is positively associated with HWP and AEHW among community-dwelling people. Our results confirm that educational activity can lead to more pronounced behavioural changes only when it forms a positive attitude. ©

AB  - Background: People with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are likely to face disproportionate challenges during a pandemic. They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: We conducted a telephone survey (May–June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. Findings: Mass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice. Conclusion: Our paper adds to the literature on people living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19 prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further attention.

AB  - Introduction Stroke reperfusion therapies, comprising intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and/or endovascular thrombectomy (EVT), are best practice treatments for eligible acute ischemic stroke patients. In Australia, EVT is provided at few, mainly metropolitan, comprehensive stroke centres (CSC). There are significant challenges for Australia's rural and remote populations in accessing EVT, but improved access can be facilitated by a â € drip and ship' approach. TACTICS (Trial of Advanced CT Imaging and Combined Education Support for Drip and Ship) aims to test whether a multicomponent, multidisciplinary implementation intervention can increase the proportion of stroke patients receiving EVT. Methods and analysis This is a non-randomised controlled, stepped wedge trial involving six clusters across three Australian states. Each cluster comprises one CSC hub and a minimum of three primary stroke centre (PSC) spokes. Hospitals will work in a hub and spoke model of care with access to a multislice CT scanner and CT perfusion image processing software (MIStar, Apollo Medical Imaging). The intervention, underpinned by behavioural theory and technical assistance, will be allocated sequentially, and clusters will move from the preintervention (control) period to the postintervention period. Primary outcome Proportion of all stroke patients receiving EVT, accounting for clustering. Secondary outcomes Proportion of patients receiving IVT at PSCs, proportion of treated patients (IVT and/or EVT) with good (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2) or poor (mRS score 5-6) functional outcomes and European Quality of Life Scale scores 3 months postintervention, proportion of EVT-treated patients with symptomatic haemorrhage, and proportion of reperfusion therapy-treated patients with good versus poor outcome who presented with large vessel occlusion at spokes. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee (18/09/19/4.13, HREC/18/HNE/241, 2019/ETH01238). Trial results will be disseminated widely through published manuscripts, conference presentations and at national and international platforms regardless of whether the trial was positive or neutral.

AB  - There are increasingly strict regulations surrounding the purchase and use of combustible tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes); simultaneously, the use of other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes (i.e., vaping products), has dramatically increased. However, public attitudes toward vaping vary widely, and the health effects of vaping are still largely unknown. As a popular social media, Twitter contains rich information shared by users about their behaviors and experiences, including opinions on vaping. It is very challenging to identify vaping-related tweets to source useful information manually. In the current study, we proposed to develop a detection model to accurately identify vaping-related tweets using machine learning and deep learning methods. Specifically, we applied seven popular machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perception, Transformer Neural Network, and stacking and voting ensemble models to build our customized classification model. We extracted a set of sample tweets during an outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping-related lung injury (EVALI) in 2019 and created an annotated corpus to train and evaluate these models. After comparing the performance of each model, we found that the stacking ensemble learning achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.97. All models could achieve 0.90 or higher after tuning hyperparameters. The ensemble learning model has the best average performance. Our study findings provide informative guidelines and practical implications for the automated detection of themed social media data for public opinions and health surveillance purposes.

AB  - Nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry is a branch of chemistry that has high experimental risks, has high research costs, and is subject to certain prejudices. However, it has an extremely important influence on the development of human life. It is particularly important to emphasize the general education of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry without compromising the quality of the teaching. The introduction of the general education mode into nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry overcomes the shortcomings of narrow audiences. However, single theoretical courses are limited to a slide-based lecture. Although the audience for general education is wide, it is difficult to carry out related experiments because of safety responsibility and teaching funds. In this work, VR technology was first applied to the general education of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry, and the audiences of the course were not limited to students who major in chemistry. The research results showed that not only did the VR platform effectively improve students' learning confidence, but also the effect of teacher-student interaction and the usability of VR equipment were recognized. This work may bring enlightenment to the popularization of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry through new media technology. © 2022 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - A woman in her 80s was referred as an emergency case with a large oedematous and ulcerating lesion of the right breast. There was a 5-month history of increasing breast volume with new onset skin breakdown and discharge. Imaging revealed an extensive heterogeneous mass requiring drainage. No diagnosis was received from multiple biopsies and immediate surgical resection of the breast and axillary sampling was prioritised given the deteriorating patient condition. Postoperative histology identified a biphasic Adenomyoepithelioma of low malignant potential, a rare presentation compounding the complexity of management. The diagnostic uncertainty of this case highlighted the importance of MDT collaboration and the flexibility of current management pathways when dealing with cases requiring urgent surgical intervention. Axillary sampling in the context of unsuccessful preoperative biopsy represented a comprehensive means for assessing the need for further surgical or systemic management in the context of unconfirmed malignancy in a deteriorating patient. © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2022.

AB  - The link between gaming and negative outcomes has been explored by previous research and has led to the widespread adverse attitude toward gaming (ATG) and gamers, especially from those who are unfamiliar with this activity. By implementing an audit study with gamers and non-gamers as participants (N = 1,280), we found that non-gamer participants rated gamers less as similar to their ideal marriage partners compared to non-gamers, while gamer participants did not differentiate between gamers and non-gamers in the ideal marriage partners similarity rating (IMPSR). The findings also revealed that the difference in IMPSR between gamer and non-gamer participants toward gamers was completely mediated by their ATG. These results imply that non-gamers consider gaming as an undesired characteristic, and this is due to the relatively negative attitude of non-gamers toward gaming. Current study provides a new perspective on exploring the effect of gaming by investigating the social interaction between gamers and non-gamers in real-world and suggests that the unfamiliarity of gaming can lead to the negative ATG, which may, ultimately, place gamers at a disadvantage in the context of mate selection.

AB  - The new identified virus COVID-19 has become one of the most contagious diseases in human history. The ongoing coronavirus has created severe threats to global mental health, which have resulted in crisis management challenges and international concerns related to health issues. As of September 9, 2021, there were over 223.4 million patients with COVID-19, including 4.6 million deaths and over 200 million recovered patients reported worldwide, which has made the COVID-19 outbreak one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The aggressive public health implementations endorsed various precautionary safety and preventive strategies to suppress and minimize COVID-19 disease transmission. The second, third, and fourth waves of COVID-19 continue to pose global challenges to crisis management, as its evolution and implications are still unfolding. This study posits that examining the strategic ripostes and pandemic experiences sheds light on combatting this global emergency. This study recommends two model strategies that help reduce the adverse effects of the pandemic on the immune systems of the general population. This present paper recommends NPI interventions (non-pharmaceutical intervention) to combine various measures, such as the suppression strategy (lockdown and restrictions) and mitigation model to decrease the burden on health systems. The current COVID-19 health crisis has influenced all vital economic sectors and developed crisis management problems. The global supply of vaccines is still not sufficient to manage this global health emergency. In this crisis, NPIs are helpful to manage the spillover impacts of the pandemic. It articulates the prominence of resilience and economic and strategic agility to resume economic activities and resolve healthcare issues. This study primarily focuses on the role of social media to tackle challenges and crises posed by COVID-19 on economies, business activities, healthcare burdens, and government support for societies to resume businesses, and implications for global economic and healthcare provision disruptions. This study suggests that intervention strategies can control the rapid spread of COVID-19 with hands-on crisis management measures, and the healthcare system will resume normal conditions quickly. Global economies will revitalize scientific contributions and collaborations, including social science and business industries, through government support.

AB  - The recent approval of several COVID-19 vaccines signals progress toward controlling the pandemic. Although social distancing and masking have been effective, vaccines are an important additional measure of protection to reduce COVID-19 spread. Adequate uptake is essential to reach herd immunity, estimated to be approximately 67%. However, vaccine hesitancy, the fast-tracked nature of the COVID-19 vaccines, and misinformation circulating through various forms of media have contributed to lower vaccination intention than desired. The current research study developed an online survey conducted via Facebook to explore the attitudes and perceptions of adult Alabama residents about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 3,781 respondents, only 44.3% reported intent to receive a vaccine, with a large proportion reporting they were unsure (28.1%). Lack of intention to vaccinate was associated with low educational attainment, low COVID-19 knowledge levels, low income, and African American race. The current survey also explored participants’ influenza vaccine behavior as this information can also be used to inform successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Of the respondents, 56% report receiving the yearly influenza vaccine and the majority receive it at a pharmacy or healthcare provider office. This informs likely successful locations for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Appropriate education targeted to populations most likely to refuse COVID-19 vaccination is essential to promote uptake. The information collected from the current study should be utilized to inform effective and efficient vaccine distribution strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Outsourcing of accounting increasingly attracts research interest, but research concerning the impact of the benefits of outsourcing on firm capabilities and performance across firms remains limited. This paper aims to reveal the unobservable latent classes of firms that outsource their accounting functions by testing a research model concerning the topic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build on accounting outsourcing research and adapt a research model from the literature on business services outsourcing. The authors analyze the data from 261 small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe using finite mixture structural equation modeling (FMSEM) and additional methods. Findings: The authors reveal three latent classes with different research models. Thriving outsourcers (N = 103) have a positive attitude toward accounting outsourcing and associate competitive capabilities with mediating the relationship from outsourcing benefits to firm performance. Annoyed outsourcers (N = 143) are dissatisfied with their accounting service provider and only associate outsourcing benefits with competitive capabilities. Convenient outsourcers (N = 15) feel comfortable with their current accounting service provider and associate outsourcing benefits with neither capabilities nor with firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The study initiates the discussion about the unobservable heterogeneity among accounting outsourcers. The study introduces the use of the FMSEM method in accounting outsourcing research. Practical implications: The study offers novel insights concerning accounting outsourcers and proposes original explanations for their outsourcing decisions that would help both the outsourcers and accounting service providers. Originality/value: The study might be the first to categorize accounting outsourcers using FMSEM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19. Findings: While the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions. Originality/value: This paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background/Aims Cervical cancer is a leading cause of death in women in Ghana, and is often only diagnosed at the advanced stage. This study explored the experiences of women diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer as they access specialist healthcare in Ghana. Methods The study was conducted at a radiotherapy centre in a teaching hospital in Ghana. Purposive sampling technique was used to select 15 women aged between 33 and 67 years with advanced cervical cancer. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information from participants regarding their experiences of services. Interviews were audio recorded with participants' consent. Data were analysed using content analysis. Results Content analysis revealed three themes: diagnostic process, information concerns and healthcare staff's attitudes. The following subthemes were also identified: delays, misdiagnosis, information gaps, perceived lack of knowledge from healthcare staff, positive attitudes from healthcare staff and breaking bad news. Conclusions The findings highlight the need to educate healthcare professionals about the symptoms of cervical cancer to allow early and accurate diagnosis. Training is also needed to equip healthcare staff with the therapeutic communication skills and strategies required for communicating bad news to patients. © Distributed under Creative Commons CC BY-NC 4.0

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of people’s lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. People’s positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional pre–COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus. Methods: One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported. Results: Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus. Discussion: Dispositional time attitudes would impact students’ capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Valuing diversity and intergroup contact predict less prejudice and discrimination, yet their relationship deserves closer attention. There is some evidence that valuing diversity and intergroup contact are associated, but it has not been tested whether the established effects of contact come about through changes in valuing diversity. We address this in two studies (total N = 2835) that consider valuing diversity as a mediator of intergroup contact. They show that valuing diversity mediates the relationships of intergroup contact with prejudice, bystander intervention intentions, policy support and approach intentions. Our results increase the understanding of pathways from intergroup contact to intergroup relations and offer a lever that contact interventions can target. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In post-Ebola Guinea, the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative (HC3) project worked to rebuild trust in the health system and increase the utilization of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health services. Core to HC3 Guinea was the promotion of quality local health centers through the Gold Star campaign (2016-2017). The current study aimed to determine the relationship between campaign exposure and attitudes/intentions regarding local health centers, to inform communication efforts in future epidemics. Between June-July 2017, HC3 Guinea conducted a telephone survey with men (n=1,000) and women (n=2,000) aged 18-49 years. Multivariate regression analyses estimated the association between campaign exposure and attitudinal/intention outcomes for the overall sample as well as for gender- and education-stratified samples. Survey results indicated that more than 30% of the sample recalled either the campaign (32.5%) or logo (37.6%). Statistically significant associations existed between exposure and various attitudinal outcomes. For example, regardless of gender/level of education, campaign recall was strongly associated with agreeing that the local health center improved in the last 6 months. Given that the campaign itself was short in duration, it is encouraging that attitudes changed with campaign exposure. Although a greater percentage of women than men held positive attitudes about health facilities, men seemed more influenced by campaign exposure. The current study provides evidence that mass media campaigns can help rebuild trust in health care facilities after an epidemic. Study findings also stress the value of conducting stratified analyses by important demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, education). Stratified analyses can help identify meaningful differences and better tailor health promotion activities and achieve greater success. The recent recurrence of Ebola in Guinea has resulted in renewed discussions about ways to incorporate these evaluation findings into current programming, including exploring ways to address gender considerations in message design and overall program strategy. © Gurman et al.

AB  - Cataclysmic changes by the gradual spread of COVID-19 have triggered the interest of scientists, scholars, academicians, and linguists in analyzing the discourse related to the spread of the pandemic. The descriptions made by all of these scholars not only contribute to language with linguistic innovations but also cause the emergence of human attitudes and behaviours. At the same time, the issues raised through the language used during the challenging time of such crises shape and reveal several human schemas of language, discourse, society, and culture. Several studies on past situations of diseases and calamities have provided critical analyses of these schemas of difficult times in human history. Discourses through various linguistic practices in this regard play a crucial role in shaping and demonstrating the schemas of the crisis hit societies. Media discourse, specifically, has hidden powers to exercise, identify and report various socio-cultural issues. The current study focuses on finding the themes of socio-cultural attitudes and behaviours that emerged from newspaper editorials published in Pakistani newspapers in February, March and April, 2020. To achieve this goal, the corpus-driven analysis of 198 newspaper editorials having 215,842 words was conducted. The study revealed various themes that prevailed in this pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The themes included the metaphoric use of the language such as battle, corps and frontline; racism while naming the virus as China virus or Hazara virus; conspiracy theories assumed to be associated with COVID-19 spread i.e. suspected involvement of Bill Gates and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US and World Health Organization (WHO); negligence on the part of people; and criticism on government for health facilities and implications of globalization. It is concluded, based on these findings, that media representation of pre-vaccination phase of COVID-19 in Pakistan is loaded with unhealthy discourse which could have been avoided in order to shape positive attitudes and behaviours of the masses. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the normal life of people around the world and has forced them to maintain social distance, self-quarantine and closing of many businesses. So, the people wish to share the information regarding the pandemic through social media e.g. Twitter. The key objective of this paper is to identify the sentiment associated with the pandemic by utilizing the tweets regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and by using the python libraries to perform the task. We analyze the sentiment of people when Coronavirus has attained a peak level using the machine, deep learning techniques and TextBlob. We have classified the sentiments into positive and negative classes using the Machine Learning (NB, SVM, Logistic regression) approaches and deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model. The Bi-LSTM approach has achieved better accuracy (0.87) compared to the traditional machine learning models for Twitter sentiment classification. From the overall analysis, we could conclude that people are confident and they express more positivity towards the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an analysis will help the policy and decision-makers to address the needs of the public appropriately. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The (purely) relative definition of poverty remains influential as an evaluative yardstick for various government policies. Left-wing social policy scholars and anti-poverty campaigners' strong commitment to it contrasts sharply with public attitudes. Regression models using British Social Attitudes data found that ideological orientation was the most consistently powerful predictor of how people define poverty. Evidence suggests anti-poverty organisations' campaign failures might be due to ideological opposition or to the conceptual weakness of purely relative poverty rather than (as campaigners have claimed) ineffective campaign tactics or the influence of the mass media. Conservative politicians have little to fear in opposing the Marxist concept. © 2021 The Author. Economic Affairs published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Institute of Economic Affairs.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 forced the implementation of restrictive measures in Spain, such as lockdown, home confinement, social distancing, and isolation. It is necessary to study whether limited access to basic services and decreased family and social support could have deleterious effects on cognition, quality of life, and mental health in vulnerable older people. Objective: This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia as the main outcome and the quality of life, perceived health status, and depression as secondary outcomes and to analyze the association of living alone and a change in living arrangements with those outcomes and other variables related with the use of technology and health services. Likewise, this study aims to analyze the association of high and low technophilia with those variables, to explore the access and use of health care and social support services, and, finally, to explore the informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: This cohort study was conducted in Málaga (Spain). In total, 151 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART4MD (n=75, 49.7%) and TV-AssistDem (n=76, 50.3%) randomized clinical trials, were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 26, 2020. All participants had undergone 1-3 assessments (in 6-month intervals) on cognition, quality of life, and mood prior to the COVID-19 breakout. Results: The outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, and mood of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Perceived stress was reported as moderate during the outbreak. After correction for multiple comparisons, living alone, a change in living arrangements, and technophilia were not associated with negative mental health outcomes. However, being alone was nominally associated with self-perceived fear and depression, and higher technophilia with better quality of life, less boredom, perceived stress and depression, and also less calmness. Overall, health care and social support service access and utilization were high. The most used ICTs during the COVID-19 outbreak were the television for informative, cognitive, and entertainment-related uses and the smartphone for socialization. Conclusions: Our findings show that the first months of the outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, perceived health status, and depression of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Living alone and low technophilia require further research to establish whether they are risk factors of mental health problems during lockdowns in vulnerable populations. Moreover, although ICTs have proven to be useful for informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses during the pandemic, more evidence is needed to support these interventions. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Background: Physical exercise has been found to assert a positive impact on many muscular conditions. Exercise under face-to-face supervision is the gold standard, but access to it is limited, for instance, for economic reasons. App-guided therapy is an intervention that is more affordable and easily accessible. However, attitude toward technology is a key predictor for media adoption and is therefore expected to shape user experience during app-guided therapy. This might be of particular importance for mastery experience, which is crucial for promoting exercise-related self-efficacy and perceived usefulness of the interaction. Both should empower patients to continuously exercise. Objective: This study sought to test whether attitudes toward technology predict mastery experience and perceived usefulness of the interaction after an app- versus a physiotherapist-guided treatment. We expect that attitudes toward technology positively predict both outcomes in case of the app-guided but not in case of the physiotherapist-guided treatment. Methods: Patients (n=54) with clinically diagnosed hip osteoarthritis participated in 2 training sessions with the same exercise intervention, once guided by an app on a tablet computer and once guided by a physiotherapist in a German university hospital. The order of the sessions was randomized. Attitude toward technology was assessed as predictor before the first session, while mastery experience and the global perceived usefulness of interaction as self-reported outcomes after each session. Results: In line with our hypotheses, attitude toward technology predicted mastery experience (b=0.16, standard error=0.07, P=.02) and usefulness of interaction (b=0.17, standard error=0.06, P=.01) after the app-based training but not after the training delivered by a physiotherapist (P>.3 in all cases). Mastery experience was lower for the app-based training but reached a very similar level as the physiotherapist-guided training for those holding a very positive attitude toward technology. Conclusions: The attitude toward technology predicts the extent of mastery experience after app-guided exercise therapy. As mastery experience is highly important for self-efficacy and future exercise behavior, attitudes toward technology should be considered when delivering app-guided exercise treatments © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, major parts of elective health care in the Netherlands, such as reproductive medicine, were paused. When health care was resumed, video consultation was used as a new solution to continue consultations with the new governmental rules of social distancing. Prior to this COVID-19 situation, video consultation was not used extensively in the Netherlands; therefore, physicians and patients are not familiar with this way of consultation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure the level of patient centeredness and shared decision making in infertile couples who have undergone fertility workup through video consultation. Methods: This is a questionnaire study with an additional qualitative part for a more in depth understanding. Infertile couples (ie, male and female partners with an unfulfilled wish for a child after 1 year of unprotected intercourse) were referred to a fertility center and underwent fertility workup through video consultation. The fertility workup consisted of 2 separate video consultations, with diagnostic tests according to a protocol. After the last video consultation couples received a digital questionnaire, which consisted of a modified version of the Patient-Centered Questionnaire-Infertility (PCQ-I) and CollaboRATE questionnaire. Fifty-three eligible infertile couples were approached, and of these, 22 participated. Four women were approached for a semistructured interview. Results: The median score on the modified PCQ-I (scale of 0 to 3) was 2.64. The highest rating was for the subscale communication and information, and the lowest rating was for the subscale organization of care. The median score on the CollaboRATE questionnaire (scale of 1 to 9) was 8 for all 3 subquestions. Patients mentioned privacy, less travel time, and easy use of the program as possible benefits of video consultation. However, patients preferred the first consultation with their physician to be face-to-face consultation as video consultation was considered less personal. Conclusions: The high levels of patient centeredness and shared decision making show that video consultation is a promising way of providing care remotely, although attention has to be payed to mitigate the more impersonal setting of video consultation when compared with face-to-face consultation. © Hilde Grens, Jan Peter de Bruin, Aleida Huppelschoten, Jan A M Kremer.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is a health crisis that requires individuals to comply with many health-protective behaviors. Following the previous literature, cultural tightness has been found to be a key mechanism to increase coordination in order to mitigate collective threats (e.g., COVID-19). In this study, we test a moderated mediation model to examine whether the perceived COVID-19 threat could intensify the extent of desired tightness (i.e., a personal desire for cultural tightness), moderated by age. Subsequently, we test whether this could intensify individuals’ emotional reactions to non-compliance with COVID-19 health protective behaviors. The study relies on a cross-sectional design, with a sample of 624 participants residing in central Italy (i.e., Lazio). The data were collected from February to October 2021. Questionnaires contained self-reporting measures of the perceived COVID-19 threat, desired tightness, and personal emotional reactions to non-compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures (e.g., wearing a mask). The results confirm that the perceived COVID-19 threat is associated with an increase in the desire for cultural tightness—and that this relationship was moderated by age—and, consequently, with intolerance for noncompliance with preventive behaviors. Additionally, both direct and indirect effects of the perceived COVID-19 threat on negative emotional reactions to noncompliance were significant; this indirect effect was larger at high (+1 SD) age than at low (−1 SD) age. Overall, this research provides some insight into how people can respond to the current pandemic threat, and how this may have implications for violating rules and regulations to keep contagion under control. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Greece exhibits the lowest seafood per capita consumption amongst European Mediterranean countries, and the investigation of consumer attitudes to new seafood products would bridge the gap among producers and consumers by promoting the vertical integration of the supply chain. However, limited information exists about consumer preferences for bivalves in the Mediterranean and for wild bivalves in particular. The present study aims to investigate, for the first time, consumers’ attitudes towards the purchase and consumption of bivalves, and more specifically, towards the edible pearl oyster Pinctada imbricata radiata, in the Greek shellfish market. Adult participants from the entire country completed a questionnaire covering the basic marketing aspects of bivalve and pearl oyster consumption, such as choice, purchase, reasons for consuming bivalves, confidence in product’s hygiene certification, media influence, etc. Data analysis included uni-and multi-variate statistics to examine the possible relations between the consumers’ demographics and socio-economic characteristics, and bivalve marketing aspects. Results showed that the majority of Greek consumers chooses traditional shellfish shops for purchasing pearl oysters, prefers a certification of quality, and trusts the confirmation provided by the veterinary authorities. Consumers’ attitudes vary considerably according to their demographics and socio-economic characteristics. Multivariate models revealed that the married, highly educated consumers that live in urban places were more reluctant to try new shellfish products and to accept an innovative way of market supply. The results reflect the positive attitude of Greek consumers towards the consumption of pearl oyster, a fact that would be helpful for decision makers in the planning of production, which in turn would promote bivalve consumption in the Greek shellfish market. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In the context of current changes in the education process due to the pandemic, the main aims of this study were to highlight social capital factors within the school community that are associated with better students’ outcomes in the context of distance learning. This study was a cross-sectional population-based study. The research sample consisted of 1483 students, whose ages varied from 11 to 19 years old (56.9% were girls). Academic success in this study was measured in terms of average grade and students’ perception of their learning process or outcomes by six single items. A Five-item WHO-5 questionnaire was used to measure students’ psychological well-being. Social capital was measured in terms of relationship, trust, reciprocity, and communication within different social contexts in the school community in total by 16 items. School social capital and social support scales were developed from these items. Students’ gender and age were also taken into consideration. The research results show that although social capital from parents and peers also matters, the relationship with teachers emerges as the main and the most important resource in supporting positive attitudes and outcomes in to learning (std.β varied from 0.116 to 0.439). The results also show that higher psychological wellbeing is associated with higher perceived school social capital (std.β 0.260) and social support (std.β 0.326) and mediates the effects of the latter two for better academic success outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of close and trusting social ties, especially between students and their teachers as well as parents for better learning outcomes in times of crises and in the context of distance learning. The study results prove that social support and social capital at school are essential factors for sustainable psychological development. The results presumably support the idea that the school is sustainable if it is developing as an ecosystem not solely aimed at academic outcomes. The results of the current study may aid policymakers and practitioners in developing interventions, policies and practices that focus resources where they will have the greatest benefit. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Starting from the Positive Organizational Behavior movement, several studies showed that some personal resources and some contextual features within the working context might encourage individuals and groups in thriving, thus providing a concrete competitive advantage for organizations. Among the individual factors, psychological capital (PsyCap) received a special interest because it was proved to promote positive work attitudes and behaviors. The present study aimed to investigate the positive effect of PsyCap on extra‐role behaviors considering the mediating role of work engagement. A mediational hypothesis was tested via SEM on 1219 Italian employees, balanced for gender. Results suggested that work engagement partially mediated the positive relationship between PsyCap and extra‐role behaviors. The present study shed a light on the psychological mechanisms according to which PsyCap positively affects extra‐role behaviors. In line with the Positive Organizational Behavior Movement Theory, personal resources, i.e., PsyCap, tend to improve work engagement that, in turn, tends to promote positive behaviors at work. Finally, the present study discussed results especially in terms of practical implications in order to promote employees’ PsyCap in organizational setting. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Authenticity is an increasingly important factor in citizens’ evaluations of political candidates and their voting decisions. As citizens value political authenticity, politicians attempt to appear true to themselves in the public eye. However, little research has examined how these perceptions of politicians as more or less authentic are constructed. This study examines how citizens form perceptions of politicians’ authenticity and particularly sheds light on the relationship between political media exposure and perceived political authenticity. Drawing on the literature on performed authenticity in social media, personalized media coverage, and information processing, we examine the effects of exposure to political information in different media on perceptions of political authenticity and its subdimensions. Results from an online quota survey in Germany (N = 1,210) show that differences in perceived political authenticity are not simply determined by citizens’ political attitudes but can also be explained by their frequency of exposure to political information in different media types. When citizens use private TV news, political accounts on social media, and follow candidate profiles, they perceive politicians as more authentic. Our analyses also suggest that some effects of media exposure on perceived political authenticity are conditioned by citizens’ party identification and their tendency to select ideologically congruent political information. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In 2020, in the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Aotearoa New Zealand consistently maintained stringent public health measures including stay-at-home lockdowns and distancing responses. Considering the widespread disruption to social functioning caused by the pandemic, this paper aimed to explore environmental and social factors that influenced the wellbeing of individuals during the first lockdown in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our mixed-methods study involved a survey (n = 1010) and semi-structured interviews of a subset of surveyed individuals undertaken at the tail end of the first 2020 lockdown. Survey participants were recruited through social media-driven snowball sampling, less than 50% were aged under 45 years and 85% identified as female. Of those interviewed, 63% identified as female. Qualitative interview findings and open-ended survey results were analysed thematically. Participants described a variety of factors influencing wellbeing, largely related to the community and household; physical, behavioural, and lifestyle factors; access to health services; and social and economic foundations. While much of the focus of COVID-19 recovery was on reversing the economic and physical toll of the pandemic, our findings emphasise the need to empower individuals, families, and communities to mitigate the pandemic’s negative implications on wellbeing. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - One of the main roles of schooling is equipping students with civic values and preparing them for participation in democratic societies. However, what should be taught and what kind of citizenship should be promoted are core issues in civic education, especially in the time of globalization. As several researchers stated, what kind of citizens we want to nurture and what kind of school curricula will best promote it are contentious topics among educators and policy-makers. The purpose of this article is to examine the influence of speaking a foreign language, social media use and types of citizenship on global competence. The correlational survey model was applied for the study. The participants were selected through cluster random sampling during the 2018–19 academic year. This study was implemented with 425 high-school students in Turkey. The author used the Global Citizenship Scale and ‘What Kind of Citizen’ survey. The findings showed that the number of social networks that participants engaged in was positively related to global competence. A positive attitude towards participatory citizenship was also associated with global competence. Multiple regression was conducted to deter-mine the best linear combination of speaking a foreign language, social media use, and attitude towards participatory citizenship for predicting global competence. Test results showed that the combination of these variables significantly predicted global competence. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.

AB  - Governments throughout the world have set social distancing guidelines to manage COVID-19 that reduced opportunities for maintaining social connections through face-to-face interactions. For this study, we conceptualized social collaboration as an intentional social activity in which people are willing to share their knowledge, experience, and expertise. We examined the relative impacts of we-intention (WI), moral trust (MT), and self-motivation (SM) on participation in social collaboration (PSC) and knowledge sharing (KS). We distributed a questionnaire-based survey to a group of Nepalese residents who actively participated in, commented on, and posted questions on social networking sites and received a total of 239 valid questionnaires for analysis. We tested and verified the research model and variables in SPSS 20 to investigate how PSC accelerates KS intention at digital platforms. The standardized path coefficient for PSM to KS was 0.75, suggesting that social collaborator’s participation has a strong positive effect on KS purpose. The standardized path coefficients for WI to MT, WI to PSC, WI to SM, MT to PSC, and SM to PSC were 0.55, 0.72, 0.49, 0.42, and 0.67, respectively. All of the values supported the hypothesis and were significant at p ≤ 0.001. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The high use of gasoline and diesel vehicles results in environmental pollution and loss of natural resources. The use of electric vehicles can be socially beneficial and reduce air pollution. In this research study, the main aims are to identify the potential of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Pakistan using a Stated Preferences (SP) survey. An SP questionnaire was designed using the theoretical framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). This questionnaire consisted of travelers’ personal and travel characteristics and various statements designed to address the variables of TPB such as Attitudes Towards the Electric Vehicles, Subjective Norms (SN), Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), and Behavioral Intentions (BI). The behavior items were designed in the context of travelers’ willingness to buy and use EVs. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFAs) were conducted to validate the designed hypotheses related to the variables of TPB. The cross-analysis revealed that there are variations in responses across different occupations, trip distances, travel modes, and vehicle ownership. The developed structural models showed that the Attitudes and PBC have a positive influence on BI and PBC, which also have a direct impact on travelers’ willingness to use EV. The SN, PBC, and Attitudes are significant predictors of behavioral intentions in the willingness to buy EV and PBC is not a direct predictor of travelers’ willingness to buy an EV. The BI acts as a mediator to explain the indirect effects of Attitudes, SN, and PBC on willingness to purchase and use an EV. In the end, a framework is also proposed for the behavior-related interventions to promote the EVs considering the socio-economic context of Pakistan. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze the positive relationship between different dimensions (knowledge, attitudes, and ability) of the Climate‐Change Competence in the participants of a Massive Open Online Course called “Awareness and Training on Climate Change for Primary and Secondary Teachers”. This study describes the use of this competence to introduce Climate Change into formal education and provides an example of how it can be used to design educational interventions to mobilize the students through education. We carried out a correlational research design based on mediation and moderation models using a process macro for questionnaires about the Climate‐Change Competence. In this study, we used a sample of 530 people from Spain and Latin America (52% female, mean age = 36.1 years). The findings revealed that knowledge about Climate Change is a good predictor of ability and attitude. Furthermore, we predicted that the relationship between knowledge and ability would be mediated by attitude. Likewise, we hypothesized that attitude is a moderating dimension between knowledge and ability. The results supported our prediction and showed that attitude is a strong mediator in the relationship between knowledge and ability. However, the interaction between knowledge and attitude did not improve the ability to cope with Climate Change. The Climate‐Change Competence is an efficient tool to introduce Climate Change into formal education. It can also be used to investigate, for the first time, the relationship between knowledge, ability, and attitude, which is essential to transform education into a necessary tool for mitigation and adaptation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software “Text Mind”, a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: Critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been damaging to the lives of people all around the world. Accompanied by the pandemic is an infodemic, an abundant and uncontrolled spread of potentially harmful misinformation. The infodemic may severely change the pandemic’s course by interfering with public health interventions such as wearing masks, social distancing, and vaccination. In particular, the impact of the infodemic on vaccination is critical because it holds the key to reverting to pre-pandemic normalcy. This paper presents findings from a global survey on the extent of worldwide exposure to the COVID-19 infodemic, assesses different populations’ susceptibility to false claims, and analyzes its association with vaccine acceptance. Based on responses gathered from over 18,400 individuals from 40 countries, we find a strong association between perceived believability of COVID-19 misinformation and vaccination hesitancy. Our study shows that only half of the online users exposed to rumors might have seen corresponding fact-checked information. Moreover, depending on the country, between 6% and 37% of individuals considered these rumors believable. A key finding of this research is that poorer regions were more susceptible to encountering and believing COVID-19 misinformation; countries with lower gross domestic product (GDP) per capita showed a substantially higher prevalence of misinformation. We discuss implications of our findings to public campaigns that proactively spread accurate information to countries that are more susceptible to the infodemic. We also defend that fact-checking platforms should prioritize claims that not only have wide exposure but are also perceived to be believable. Our findings give insights into how to successfully handle risk communication during the initial phase of a future pandemic. © 2022 Singh et al.

AB  - Governments around the world are seeking to slow the spread of Covid-19 by implementing measures that encourage, or mandate, changes in people’s behaviour. These changes include the wearing of face masks, social distancing, and testing and self-isolating when unwell. The success of these measures depends on the commitment of individuals to change their behaviour accordingly. Understanding and predicting the motivation of individuals to change their behaviour is therefore critical in assessing the likely effectiveness of these measures in slowing the spread of the virus. In this paper we draw on a novel framework, the I3 Compliance Response Framework, to understand and predict the motivation of residents in Auckland, New Zealand, to comply with measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The Framework is based on two concepts. The first uses the involvement construct to predict the motivation of individuals to comply. The second separates the influence of the policy measure from the influence of the policy outcome on the motivation of individuals to comply. In short, the Framework differentiates between the strength of individuals’ motivation and their beliefs about the advantages and disadvantages of policy outcomes and policy measures. We found this differentiation was useful in predicting an individual’s possible behavioural responses to a measure and discuss how it could assist government agencies to develop strategies to enhance compliance. © 2022 Kaine et al.

AB  - Social responsibility is understood to be one of the crucial strategic responsibilities for organizations across the globe. In the digital era, firms have transformed social responsibility initiatives into digital platforms. This study aims to investigate the effects of digital social responsibility (DSR) on electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and purchase intention (PI) in the social media context. This survey research is based on 214 samples, collected via an online questionnaire as a research tool. Structural equation modelling has been used to validate the proposed hypotheses. The results show that perceived DSR has significant positive influence on consumers’ attitude (b = 0.408) and eWOM (b = 0.238). The mediation analysis indicates that consumers’ attitude partially mediates the relationship between DSR and eWOM (DE = 0.238, IE = 0.154), and fully mediates the relationship between DSR and PI (DE = 0.08, IE = 0.173). Since few previous studies have explored the impact of DSR toward eWOM and PI, our study confirms the effects of DSR on consumers’ attitudes and eWOM. This empirical study can provide managers with further understanding of the effects of DSR via social media on consumers’ attitude and eWOM. Our results should also encourage firms to implement DSR initiatives to enhance consumers’ positive attitudes and spread positive word of mouth about firms. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate food wastage attitudes and the impact of social media among the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. A questionnaire was distributed via social network applications (n = 525). The majority of the respondents were females (84%) and social media users (99%). Most of the respondents were well aware of the problem of food wastage (96%). Half of the respondents (53.7 and 48.8%) reported taking some form of action on an ‘often’ basis to reduce food wastage, and buying food as per their needs, respectively. Two-thirds (66.7%) of the respondents stated that their family did not throw away anything from their last meal. A majority (82.3%) felt uncomfortable upon discarding food. A mixed response was observed in terms of food wastage and social media usage. On one hand, using social media was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with measuring the exact quantity of ingredients prior to preparation, lower overall family wastage, eating leftovers, and composting. On the other hand, less-frequent social media users significantly (p < 0.05) had fewer leftovers, checked expiry dates, were more serious about food wastage, and planned to minimize it. Social media should be used with prudence as it may not have a very significant impact on food wastage reduction. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, conspiracy theories about the virus spread rapidly, and whilst governments across the globe put in place different restrictions and guidelines to contain the pandemic, these were not universally adhered to. This research examined the association between pandemic related risk perceptions, belief in conspiracy theories, and compliance with COVID-19 public guidelines amongst a UK sample (n = 368). Participants rated their level of concern for a series of potential risks during the pandemic (to the economy, personal health, freedom, media integrity and health risk to others). Participants also rated their level of belief in different conspiracy theories and self-reported their behaviour during the first UK lockdown. Mediational analyses showed that stronger belief in conspiracy theories was associated with perceptions of lower risk to health and higher risk to the economy and freedom, which in turn were associated with lower compliance with COVID-19 related governmental guidelines. Perception of information transparency risks did not mediate the association between belief in conspiracy theories and compliant behaviours. These results highlight the key role that risk perception may play in translating belief in conspiracy theories into low compliance with governmental COVID-19 related guidelines. Our findings suggest new patterns with respect to the relationship between conspiracy theory adherence and salience of different risk perceptions amidst the pandemic, which could have implications for the development of public health messaging and communication interventions.

AB  - Objective:To examine long-haul truck drivers (LHTD) perceptions of COVID-19 and their use of health and safety practices.Methods:146 LHTD completed an online survey to collect data on their experiences with COVID-19. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, and thematic analysis for open-ended responses.Results:LHTD were aged from 22 to 79 years (mean age 48.1 ± 11.8); 82.2% were men. Almost half of the sample were not concerned about COVID-19. Those not concerned were significantly less likely to employ health and safety practices (eg, wearing masks, social distancing), were less educated and healthier. They also perceived COVID-19 to not be real or a serious threat to their health.Conclusions:Tailored education approaches are needed to provide evidence-based data on COVID-19 risks and complications.

AB  - After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread across the world, countries have adopted containment measures to stop its transmission, limit fatalities, and relieve hospitals from straining and overwhelming conditions imposed by the virus. Many countries implemented social distancing and lockdown strategies that negatively impacted their economies and the psychological wellbeing of their citizens, even though they contributed to saving lives. Recently approved and available, COVID-19 vaccines can provide a really viable and sustainable option for controlling the pandemic. However, their uptake represents a global challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and logistic– organizational hurdles that have made its distribution stagnant in several developed countries despite several appeals by the media, policy-and decision-makers, and community leaders. Vaccine distribution is also a concern in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of doses. The objective of the present study was to set up a metric to assess vaccination uptake and identify national socio-economic factors influencing this indicator. We conducted a cross-country study. We first estimated the vaccination uptake rate across countries by fitting a logistic model to reported daily case numbers. Using the uptake rate, we estimated the vaccine roll-out index. Next, we used Random Forest, an “off-the-shelf” machine learning algorithm, to study the association between vaccination uptake rate and socio-economic factors. We found that the mean vaccine roll-out index is 0.016 (standard deviation 0.016), with a range between 0.0001 (Haiti) and 0.0829 (Mongolia). The top four factors associated with the vaccine roll-out index are the median per capita income, human development index, percentage of individuals who have used the internet in the last three months, and health expenditure per capita. The still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the disparity in vaccine adoption across low-and high-income countries, which represents a global public health challenge. We must pave the way for universal access to vaccines and other approved treatments, regardless of demographic structures and underlying health conditions. Income disparity remains, instead, an important cause of vaccine inequity, which restricts the functioning of the global vaccine allocation framework and, thus, the ending of the pandemic. Stronger mechanisms are needed to foster countries’ political willingness to promote vaccine and drug access equity in a globalized society where future pandemics and other global health crises can be anticipated. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Previous scholarly literature has documented a pronounced increase in the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in American news media content. Some have referred to this shift in journalistic discourse and related public opinion trends signaling increasing perceptions of prejudice severity in U.S. society as The Great Awokening. This work analyzes whether the increasing prevalence of prejudice themes in American news media outlets has been replicated in the news media ecosystem of a Spanish-speaking country. Thus, we computationally analyzed the prevalence of words denoting prejudice in five million news and opinion articles written between 1976 and 2019 and published in three of the most widely read newspapers in Spain: El País, El Mundo and ABC. We report that within the studied time period, the frequency of terms that denote specific prejudice types related to gender, ethnicity, sexuality and religious orientation has also substantially increased across the analyzed Spanish news media outlets. There are, however, some notable distinctions in the long-term usage dynamics of prejudice-denoting terms between the leading Spanish newspaper of record, El País, and its U.S. counterpart, The New York Times. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Background: Flavored electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become popular in recent years, especially among youth and young adults. To address the epidemic of e-cigarettes, New York State approved a ban on sales of most flavored vaping products other than tobacco and menthol flavors on September 17, 2019. Objective: This study aims to examine the attitude of Twitter users to the policy on flavored e-cigarettes in New York State and the impact of this policy on public perceptions of e-cigarettes. This study also compares the attitudes and topics between New York Twitter users and Twitter users from other states who were not directly affected by this policy. Methods: Tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes were collected using the Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 2019 to December 2019. Tweets from New York State and those from other states that did not have a flavored e-cigarette policy were extracted. Sentiment analysis was applied to analyze the proportion of negative and positive tweets about e-cigarettes or the flavor policy. Topic modeling was applied to e-cigarette-related data sets and New York flavor policy-related data sets to identify the most frequent topics before and after the announcement of the New York State policy. Results: We found that the average number of tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes increased in both New York State and other states after the flavor policy announcement. Sentiment analysis revealed that after the announcement of the New York State flavor policy, in both New York State and other states, the proportion of negative tweets on e-cigarettes increased from 34.07% (4531/13,299) to 44.58% (18,451/41,390) and from 32.48% (14,320/44,090) to 44.40% (64,262/144,734), respectively, while positive tweets decreased significantly from 39.03% (5191/13,299) to 32.86% (13,601/41,390) and from 42.78% (18,863/44,090) to 33.93% (49,105/144,734), respectively. The majority of tweets related to the New York State flavor policy were negative both before and after the announcement of this policy in both New York (87/98, 89% and 3810/4565, 83.46%, respectively) and other states (200/255, 78.4% and 12,695/15,569, 81.54%, respectively), while New York State had a higher proportion of negative tweets than other states. Topic modeling results demonstrated that teenage vaping and health problems were the most discussed topics associated with e-cigarettes. Conclusions: Public attitudes toward e-cigarettes became more negative on Twitter after New York State announced the policy on flavored e-cigarettes. Twitter users in other states that did not have such a policy on flavored e-cigarettes paid close attention to the New York State flavor policy. This study provides some valuable information about the potential impact of the flavored e-cigarettes policy in New York State on public attitudes toward flavored e-cigarettes. © Li Sun, Xinyi Lu, Zidian Xie, Dongmei Li.

AB  - The potential of games in empowering underrepresented groups is a central theme in the field of media studies. However, to ensure that everyone can benefit from them, it is necessary to ensure that they are inclusive and accessible. In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Owners may enhance their cats’ welfare by social enrichment (e.g. positive human-animal interactions), and physical enrichment (e.g. play objects). The purpose of this study was to investigate associations between owner characteristics (e.g. attitudes, attachment), household characteristics (the keeping of one or more cats) and owner behaviours enriching their cats’ lives. Another aim was to use the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB, using question sets targeting attitudes towards behaviours directed/activities provided to cats, normative and control beliefs) to identify predictors of owner behavior, represented by duration of a play session, number of toys constantly available/cat and frequency of outdoor access. Finally, we aimed to investigate associations between owner and cat behaviours. To this end, an online survey was conducted among cat owners. Questions assessing general attitudes, beliefs about cats’ needs, attachment, frequencies of owner-cat interactions, access to play opportunities and cat behaviour (play, unwanted behaviours) were summarised to components after principal component analyses. Owner attitudes and attachment systematically correlated with frequencies of human-cat interactions (e.g. tactile and non-tactile) and access to various play objects (p < 0.05). The general attitude that cats are ‘Beneficial’ and the TPB attitude ‘Important to play with cats’ were significant predictors of the duration of a play session (β = 0.15/0.14), accounting for 8% of the variance. Owner age, the husbandry decision to keep one or more cats and the TPB attitude ‘Important to offer different toys’ significantly predicted the number of toys constantly available/cat (β = −0.12/−0.47/0.45), accounting for 36% of the variance. Predictors of the frequency of outdoor access were the TPB attitude ‘Important to offer outdoor access’ and the control belief that the outdoors were too dangerous (β = 0.23/−0.60), accounting for 62% of the variance. According to structural models, an effect of attachment on owner behaviour is mediated by attitudes. Owner behaviours systematically correlated with cat play (p < 0.05) but not problem behaviours. The overall results suggest clearly identifiable relationships between attitudes, owner and animal behaviour. They provide insight into attitudes and owner behaviours to target when designing interventions to influence cat owner behaviour. Since positive owner–cat interactions were associated with cat play behaviour, a potential indicator of enhanced welfare, this study underlines the important role of the owner for cat welfare. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Instagram is used as an effective and visual marketing channel for building brand equity in the minds of consumers. Therefore, this study aims to classify Instagram marketing activities and analyze the associated effects on customer-based brand equity (brand awareness, brand image, perceived quality, brand love, and Instagram re-usage intention) formation through Instagram marketing activities. To this end, data were collected from 358 coffee consumers who had visited any of the five coffee brand Instagram accounts used in this study and analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. The results showed that four sub-dimensions (interaction, entertainment, customization, and trendiness) of Instagram marketing activities affect brand equity (brand awareness, brand image, and perceived quality), which in turn led to attitudinal loyalty (brand love) and behavioral loyalty (Instagram re-usage intention) towards the brand. This research comprehensively illustrates the influences of Instagram marketing activities on customer-based brand equity. The findings of this study will enable coffee brands to more accurately forecast the future purchasing behaviors of their customers through Instagram marketing activities and provide a guide to managing brand equity as well. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As we transition away from pandemic-induced isolation and social distancing, there is a need to estimate the risk of exposure in built environments. We propose a novel metric to quantify social distancing and the potential risk of exposure to airborne diseases in an indoor setting, which scales with distance and the number of people present. The risk of exposure metric is designed to incorporate the dynamics of particle movement in an enclosed set of rooms for people at different immunity levels, susceptibility due to age, background infection rates, intrinsic individual risk factors (e.g., comorbidities), mask-wearing levels, the half-life of the virus and ventilation rate in the environment. The model parameters have been selected for COVID-19, although the modeling framework applies to other airborne diseases. The performance of the metric is tested using simulations of a real physical environment, combining models for walking, path length dynamics, and air-conditioning replacement action. We have also created a visualization tool to help identify high-risk areas in the built environment. The resulting software framework is being used to help with planning movement and scheduling in a clinical environment ahead of reopening of the facility, for deciding the maximum time within an environment that is safe for a given number of people, for air replacement settings on air-conditioning and heating systems, and for mask-wearing policies. The framework can also be used for identifying locations where foot traffic might create high-risk zones and for planning timetabled transitions of groups of people between activities in different spaces. Moreover, when coupled with individual-level location tracking (via radio-frequency tagging, for example), the exposure risk metric can be used in real-time to estimate the risk of exposure to the coronavirus or other airborne illnesses, and intervene through air-conditioning action modification, changes in timetabling of group activities, mask-wearing policies, or restricting the number of individuals entering a given room/space.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has changed individual lives to the core. Through national curfews and social distancing, individuals’ social lives changed and led to increased levels of stress and mental health problems. As another consequence, communication, especially among young people, has shifted to social networking sites, where particularly young adults sought help for their mental health problems. In recent years, Instagram has received recognition for its health-enhancing potentials. On this social networking site, more than 1 billion users worldwide post 500 million stories and images per day. Methods: During COVID-19, increasing mental health incidences were reported throughout the world, and have led mental health influencers to gain in relevance. The proposed study is based on a quantitative survey. In order to test how different content formats utilized by mental health influencers —motivational quotes, comics, or influencer posts—are evaluated by Instagram users, a cross-sectional quantitative study was conducted in April 2021. Data collection was based on convenience sampling. In total, 532 Austrian respondents between 16 and 34 years of age participated in the survey. Results: Overall, the content that received the most favorable evaluations were both the motivational quote (M = 4.23) and the influencer post (M = 4.12), while the comics scored lower in terms of evaluations (M = 3.72). Conclusions: Respondents’ preference of content suggests that individuals seek out content that boosts their esteem or content with a “human touch”. Explanations as to why the selected content formats were preferred over the other formats are offered alongside a future research outlook. © 2022 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Introduction: Living donor kidney transplantation is the preferred method of treating kidney failure. The donor agrees to undergo an elective procedure for the benefit of the recipient. Aim: To assess the attitude toward living kidney donation and to investigate the factors that contribute to kidney donation willingness. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between December 2020 and February 2021. The study covered a representative group of 953 Poles aged 18−77, living in all Polish voivodships. The relationship between sociodemographic factors, personal values (Personal Values List), the total score of life satisfaction (Satisfaction with Life Scale) and the willingness to donate a kidney to another human was assessed using a logistic regression model. Results: The most frequently chosen personal values were: good health; physical and mental fitness; love and friendship; knowledge and wisdom. The most frequently chosen symbols of happiness were: good health, successful family life, being needed by others. The median satisfaction with life for the entire group was 20 [16; 24]. Voluntary donation of a kidney to another human being i.e. family, friends, strangers were more often declared by women (OR = 1.21; Cl95%: 1.03−1.42), for whom the most important symbol of happiness was a life full of adventures, travels (OR = 1.39; Cl 95%: 1.06−1.82) and the most important personal value was goodness and tenderness (OR = 1.21; Cl95%: 1.05−1.40). Total scores of The Satisfaction with Life Scale correlated positively with the willingness to voluntarily donate a kidney (OR = 1.03; Cl95%: 1.003−1.06), while age correlated negatively (OR = 0.99; Cl95%: 0.98−0.99). Conclusions: Respondents who declare their willingness to be a living kidney donor are mainly female, for which the most important symbol of happiness is a life full of adventures and travel, and the most important values are personal goodness and tenderness. The desire to donate a kidney to another person decreases with age and grows with life satisfaction. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04789122). © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The mobile internet has resulted in intimate partner violence (IPV) events not being viewed as interpersonal and private issues. Such events become public events in the social network environment. IPV has become a public health issue of widespread concern. It is a challenge to obtain systematic and detailed data using questionnaires and interviews in traditional Chinese culture, because of face-saving and the victim’s shame factors. However, online comments about specific IPV events on social media provide rich data in understanding the public’s attitudes and emotions towards IPV. By applying text mining and sentiment analysis to the field of IPV, this study involved construction of a Chinese IPV sentiment dictionary and a complete research framework. We analyzed the trends of the Chinese public’s emotional evolution concerning IPV events from the perspectives of a time series as well as geographic space and social media. The results show that the anonymity of social networks and the guiding role of opinion leaders result in traditional cultural factors such as face-saving and family shame for IPV events being no longer applicable, leading to the spiral of an anti-silence effect. Meanwhile, in the process of public emotional communication, anger often overwhelms reason, and the spiral of silence remains in effect in social media. In addition, there are offensive words used in the IPV event texts that indicate misogyny in emotional, sexual, economic and psychological abuse. Fortunately, mainstream media, as crucial opinion leaders in the social network, can have a positive role in guiding public opinion, improving people’s ability to judge the validity of network information, and formulating people’s rational behaviour. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the ever-changing organizational and societal conditions that make reliance on external definitions of success unworkable or undesirable, subjective career success has remained a critical topic in careers studies. Among the drivers of subjective career success, research has identified personality traits and job resources as essential sources. Grit, in the form of a personality trait, together with I-deals (job resource) and perceptions of employees’ glass ceiling can provide new insights regarding factors, which can heighten employees’ subjective career success. Therefore, the main purpose of the study is to investigate the direct and indirect effect of grit on each dimension of subjective career success via I-deals and perceptions of the glass ceiling. Surveys from 221 female security forces from both private and public sector in Oyo state, Nigeria, were collected and the data was analyzed using the smartPLS. The results showed that grit is positively related to I-deals, glass ceiling and career satisfaction, but not to happiness, psychological wellbeing, and work engagement. I-deals mediated the relationship between grit and subjective career success’ dimensions, while the glass ceiling did not. This study was able to infer that personality trait (grit) has much to relate with how women perceive the existence of the glass ceiling in their organization. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new reality worldwide and reconfigured identities, behaviors and interests. It has called for heroic representations and highlighted the role of social media in efficient communication. All of the above considered, the current article focuses on the representation of the COVID-19 pandemic generated by the undergraduate students enrolled in the Social Work study program in Transilvania University of Brașov (Romania) by indicating the main connotations of the pandemic and drawing a comparison between students’ representation and the early representations of the same pandemic produced by specialized literature on the topic. The thematic analysis of the essays produced by students highlights their frustration with the havoc brought about by the pandemic to their graduation plans and with the lack of interaction with colleagues and academic staff, as well as their gratitude for the efforts undertaken by their professors to make online education functional, their availability to adapt and support the restrictive measures imposed by authorities, and their optimism about the evolution of the pandemic. The content analysis of 60 bibliographic sources on the topic of COVID-19, indicated by the Anelis+ network as the most relevant in the spring of 2020, highlights a thematic convergence between the aforementioned sources and students’ representation of COVID-19, and thus their responsible attitude toward meeting the challenges of the pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The focal aim of the project was to assess the economic anxiety (EA) and the performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during partial and full lockdowns in Kuwait. The challenges facing the SMEs during COVID-19 and the potential solutions were also explored. The call for this vital investigation was due to the global economic fallout and the shocking drop within the marketplace caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive approach was used for online survey design to collect datasets from 147 SMEs spanning all governorates of Kuwait in the period between March and June 2021. It included sociodemographic data, economic anxiety perception, potential challenges and solutions to SMEs, and SMEs’ performance. The data analysis using SPSS 25 showed that 78.2% of the SMEs were affected directly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and about 83% were affected negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, only 12.2% experienced a positive impact, mainly medical, technology, social media, food supplies, and delivery or logistics industries. With great concerns of SMEs for all dimensions related to economic anxiety (with an average of around 3.95), the greatest concerns were the financial and cash flow, followed by labor shortage (an average between 4.51 and 5.00). The results also showed that most of the performance indicators for the SMEs were low (with an average of less than or equal to 2.5), and more than 66% of them worked fewer hours during the pandemic; the number of operating hours was dropped dramatically. More than 74% of the SMEs used technology in more than 20% of their activities, representing an increase in using technologies of about 44%, and about 25.2% used social networks in more than 80% of their activities. The performance of SMEs is also found to be significantly and positively correlated with the economic anxiety levels, with a correlation coefficient of 0.186. The findings revealed significant and crucial outcomes for policymaking, decision-makers, and governmental agencies to build recovery plans and proper actions needed to manage the consequences caused by the disaster against the economic and other developments within the context of SMEs. Overall, there is a clear need to find ways and customize operations to adapt to the new work modes that require social distancing, online operations, and site management. In addition, new alternative modes of SMEs work follow to compensate for the lower working hours from the office and increased online working from home. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our daily lives, which in turn has impacted health behaviors. Young people have been particularly affected. This study aimed to assess health behaviors in Austrian apprentices and high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic and whether vaccination willingness is affected by health behaviors. Methods: Two online surveys were conducted via REDCap with 1442 apprentices (female: 53.5%, male: 45.4%) from 29 March to 18 May 2021 and 563 school students (female: 79.6%, male: 18.6%) from 19 June to 2 July 2021. The two samples were matched to account for sociodemographic differences and analyses were run on the matched sample. Besides the health behaviors, namely, smoking, alcohol consumption, cannabis consumption, and exercise, health status and vaccination willingness were also assessed. Results: Health behaviors were affected by both education group and gender. Apprentices reported significantly more smoking than high school students and this difference was more pronounced in women (all p < 0.01). Alcohol consumption was higher in apprentices than school students, but only in women (p < 0.01). There was a trend for the two education groups to differ in their cannabis use as well (p = 0.05). Apprentices took part in more weekly exercise (p < 0.0001), but high school students reported better average health status (p < 0.001). When included in the same model, health behaviors did not affect vaccine willingness, but education group did, with high school students showing a higher willingness to receive the COVD-19 vaccine than apprentices. Conclusions: These findings support the argument that education type is an important factor for health behaviors, but this is also mediated by gender. Appropriate interventions for adolescents are needed to prevent adverse health behavior changes following the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background and Aim: The COVID pandemic and countrywide lockdown has had significant impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with delay in diagnosis, difficulty in access to healthcare and unavailability of drugs. We conducted a telephonic survey to assess this impact. Methods: Out of 350, 302 participated in the survey. Demographic data, disease severity at the time of survey, extent of disease, details of therapy, and adherence were noted. A validated questionnaire addressing information source, perception of COVID-19 situation, contact with healthcare, and adherence to standard precautions was administered telephonically. Results: Out of 350 contacted patients, 302 (86.28%) patients participated in the survey. Median age of cohort was 39 years. Ulcerative colitis (UC) constituted 79%, 16% Crohn's disease (CD), and 5% IBD-unclassified. At the time of survey, 86.98% patients with UC were in clinical remission and 75.75% of CD patients were generally well. A total of 115 (38%) cases were nonadherent to therapy due to unavailability of medicines (66.38%), financial constraints (25.21%) and inability to reach healthcare facility (3.6%). Disease flare was seen in 14.2% and correlated well with nonadherence. Existing drug therapy was switched to alternative drug in 70 (23.17%) cases due to unavailability (74%). Social media (52.3%) and television (40.4%) were the common sources of information about the pandemic. Telemedicine platforms (WhatsApp and telephone) were used by 180 (59.6%) patients for consultation with good acceptance (81.6%). 87 (28.8%) patients failed to contact healthcare. Apprehension regarding severe COVID infection was noted in 80% while 29% thought that IBD therapy could increase infection risk. Adherence to wearing mask, hand washing, and social distancing was 100%. Conclusion: Pandemic resulted in disruption of healthcare visits and medication supply. Majority were concerned about increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adhered to standard precautions. Mobile phone-based formats for patient care may be an alternative due to patient acceptance and convenience. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Digital technologies and social media platforms have been used in museum communication for over a decade now, and Holocaust museums have increasingly adopted them in their modes of commemoration and provision of educational content. Nevertheless, very limited research has been conducted into the potential of social media as new memory ecologies. In this exploratory study, we conceive social media platforms as socio-technical-ecological systems whereby users develop and engage with memory practices of the Holocaust. We adopt a networked socio-ecological approach to analyse how a sample of Holocaust museums (N = 69) develop practices of digital Holocaust memory in social media. The institutions are analysed in terms of “size” (small, medium, or large), how they differ in their attitudes towards these practices, and to what extent they circulate Holocaust memory on social media. The study adopts multiple quantitative approaches and combines the results of a survey with a set of social media metrics analysing how museums engage on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in terms of generated content, interactivity, popularity, and type of content. Results show that museums have an overall positive attitude towards social media although some concerns were expressed, mostly by smaller institutions; they tend to use mostly Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and to share educational content and information about the museum's activities. However, despite a tendency to aggregate a large number of fans and followers, especially in the case of larger institutions, interaction with users remains limited. Prospects for more interactive participation and its implications are also discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Problem: Prejudices can impair social participation of people with epilepsy. Methods: From 2019 to 2020, we invited people with epilepsy and their relatives across Germany to fill in a questionnaire. Results: Two hundred and thirty people with epilepsy (PWE, median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66% female) and 103 relatives (REL, median age: 42 years; min./max. 23/70; 83% female) took part in the survey. 44% PWE and 40% REL said prejudices against PWE had not declined in recent years. Of PWE, 64% reported they had experienced prejudices themselves. In an open question with multiple answers possible, 71% of the PWE described concrete prejudices against PWE, 62% of the REL did so. The reported prejudices concerned symptoms of epilepsy (37% PWE; 23% REL), academic or occupational performance (47% PWE; 38% REL), social or family life (27% PWE, 29% REL), and other topics (7% PWE, 4% REL). Of PWE, 88% said all or almost all relatives knew about their condition, 74% stated this applied to all or almost all friends, and 48% told all or almost all colleagues about their epilepsy. Of PWE, 94% would want to know if a relative had epilepsy, 87% would like to know about a friend's epilepsy, 70% about a colleague's epilepsy. Fear of stigmatization was a reason for not always communicating the condition according to 20% PWE and 63% REL. None of PWE and 16% of REL named shame as a reason. Conclusion: People with epilepsy still experience prejudices and fear of stigmatization hinders an open communication about the condition. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To curb the spread of Covid-19, Singapore, like other cities, had to impose movement restriction and social distancing measures that may affect the well-being of its residents. In this paper, we assessed the potential benefits of gardening on the mental well-being of Singapore residents, based on the concept of mental resilience. We hypothesized that gardening activities promote mental resilience. A survey was administered on 8,786 participants of a “Gardening with Edibles” programme, measuring their mental resilience status, engagement in gardening activities and socio-demographic information. The mental resilience scores of participants who engaged in weekly gardening were compared with the scores derived from another survey conducted during the pandemic on an online community comprising demographically representative respondents with an interest on Covid-19 related community care. The results showed that the mental resilience of those who gardened was statistically significantly higher than the online community. Within the gardening group, those with less than one hour of weekly gardening time had significantly lower scores in their total mental resilience, and five out of seven resilience factors, “emotional regulation”, “relationship”, “confidence”, “positive thinking” and “spirituality”, compared to those with more weekly gardening time, showing that the efficacy of the mediating effects may peak at a weekly gardening time of between one to four hours. Home gardening may be an effective way for people living in densely populated cities to interact with nature and build mental resilience during the pandemic. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted medical practice globally. The objective of this study was to examine the changes to the practice of pediatric otolaryngology internationally due to the COVID-19 pandemic and examine potential contributors. Method: An online survey was designed to assess practice demographics, patterns of COVID-19 related restrictions in communities, and changes to practice and referrals. This was disseminated via an international Covid-19 WhatsApp™ group of pediatric otolaryngologists. Results: There were 45 respondents of 177 group members (25.4%) from 15 countries. The mean estimated time spent under strictest lockdown measures was 16.2 (±10.7) weeks (range: 1–45 weeks). Operating room time was reduced for 82.9%, with an average reported reduction of 41.5%. Almost all (>75%) of respondents reported reduced referrals for five common conditions: otitis media with effusion (average reported decrease – 56.1%); acute otitis media (average decrease 62.8%); acute mastoiditis (average decrease 66.6%); recurrent pharyngotonsillitis (average decrease 51.0%); and peritonsillar abscess (average decrease 52.1%). COVID-19 cases per million population significantly influenced the acuity of referrals received (p <.05). No conditions were reported as increased in frequency and the acuity of most conditions was reported as unchanged by the majority of respondents. Conclusion: The measures taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in many changes to pediatric otolaryngology practice and the referral patterns of common conditions. Some of these changes may have enduring sequelae. © 2021

AB  - Research Summary: This study investigates the role of the news media in shaping attitudes toward the protests of 2020. Using data from a nationally representative election survey, it examines the association between news consumption and support for law-and-order policies to address protest violence, with perceptions that the protesters were violent as a potential mediator. Findings indicate that viewers of online news are less likely to support law-and-order policies. This relationship is mediated by perceived protester violence, with perceived violence enhancing support for law-and-order policies. Further examination shows that political bias plays a role: viewers of left-leaning sites are less likely to support law-and-order policies to address protest violence, while viewers of right-leaning sites are more likely. These relationships are also mediated by perceived violence. Policy Implications: A slight majority of respondents indicate that they lean toward solving problems of racism and police violence, indicating that much of the American public is open to criminal justice reform. Perceived violence helps to shape the association of online news media with support for law-and-order policies. Activists should avoid violence in their protests and use Internet-based media sources to publicize their peaceful activities and demands. Law enforcement agencies should use the Internet and social media to keep the public informed of the reality of protests, especially of any violence that occurs, in an effort to justify forceful tactics. © 2021 American Society of Criminology

AB  - Sustainability is one of the major challenges that societies are facing. The question of why and how consumer food sustainability related issues (e.g., food waste, sustainable food shopping behavior, among others) are placed on the public agenda is therefore of high interest to food policy makers. Drawing from media agenda setting theory, this study provides the first analysis of how relationships between consumer food sustainability-related frames appear in the media. Focusing on the COVID-19 crisis, it is examined how the media framed food sustainability issues in 2019 and 2020. 271 newspaper stories are investigated through a rather new approach to quantitative content analysis that incorporated binary coding, optimal scaling, and path analysis. The study's findings point to various significant relationships between frame contents and implications and similarly bring to light the moderating effects of the COVID-19 crisis and ‘article authorship’ on a number of these relationships. The findings contribute to the understanding of how public opinion regarding food sustainability develops and can help food policymakers and authorities seeking to develop, position, and address issues relevant to food sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: During the 2020-2021 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown, social activities were limited by the government-recommended social distancing guidelines, leading to an abundance of mental health issues. Methods: We hypothesized that Twitter sentiment analysis may shed some light on Animal Crossing: New Horizons and its impact on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: We found that social gaming and social media may be used as tools to cope with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Further research, including randomized study designs and prospective measurements of mental health outcomes related to social gaming behavior are required. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Based on role congruity theory, we investigated how gender bias may influence public attitudes toward the vaccine in Turkey. Using a between-subjects design, we tested whether an emphasis on the female versus the male scientist as the vaccine’s inventor in a news story influenced attitudes about the BioNTech vaccine and vaccination intentions. Partly confirming role congruity theory, three-way interaction results from 665 participants demonstrated that among male participants with a stronger belief in traditional gender roles (compared to males with lower belief), the presence of the female inventor, either by herself or together with the male inventor, decreased the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine and reduced intentions to be vaccinated by the BioNTech vaccine. We did not observe such differences for women. These findings highlight how gender bias may influence individuals’ information processing and decision making in a way that may have negative consequences for public health. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Chinese people’s pornography use is increasing and condomless sex is prevalent in pornography. However, both the relationship between pornography and condom use among Chinese adults and the mechanisms underlying this relationship are underexplored. This study examined how perceptions of pornography were associated with attitudes toward condom use through the mediating effect of gratification of sexual pleasure and safer sex communication apprehension, and how shared pornography use with a partner during sex moderated these relationships. A total of 658 participants (391 women and 267 men) aged 18–65 years and involved in a romantic relationship completed an online survey assessing pornography consumption, condom use, gratification of sexual pleasure, and safer sex communication apprehension. Results showed that expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were associated with higher levels of gratification of sexual pleasure, which were, in turn, associated with more negative attitudes toward condom use. Expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were also associated with lower levels of safer sex communication apprehension and lower levels of negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use with a partner during sex strengthened the direct positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use during sex also strengthened the positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and gratification of sexual pleasure, and the negative relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and safer sex communication apprehension, which in turn, were significantly associated with attitudes toward condom use. Implications for sexual health education and limitations are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The social distancing measures and the related closure of education institutions have confronted young families, in particular, with various challenges. Additional risk factors such as an insecure or even unresolved maternal attachment representation may affect mental health of mothers and their children in times of increased stress such as during the ongoing pandemic. We aimed to analyze the interplay between maternal attachment representation and mother’s and children’s mental health before and during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. 91 mothers completed a “SARS-CoV-2 pandemic survey” examining the pandemic-related stress of their families including their own depressive symptomology and their children’s mental health. Our mediation analysis demonstrates that the mothers’ depressive symptomology significantly and fully mediated the relationship between maternal attachment representations and children’s mental health during the pandemic. In contrast, the indirect effect of the maternal attachment representation on children’s mental health before the pandemic through the depressive symptoms experienced by the mothers before the pandemic did not reach significance alongside the total and direct effect. The quality of the maternal attachment representation, promoted by childhood maltreatment, seems to be one relevant risk factor for the mothers’ and children’s mental health during a stressful time like a pandemic. The risk for mothers to develop depressive symptoms in times of a pandemic is significantly influenced by their current representation of previous attachment experiences. In addition, the mental well-being of mothers showed a considerable influence on the children’s mental health during a pandemic. The results underline the necessity to consider unique needs of family members and to offer specific support in the current crisis focusing on attachment issues. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: In South Africa, online learning has been adopted to maintain the momentum of learning. The need for social distancing has resulted in the cancellation of many face-to-face activities that comprised the curriculum within higher education. This study explored the experiences of undergraduate diagnostic radiography students of online teaching and learning during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Methods: A qualitative case study design was adopted. Purposive sampling was employed to select undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at the study institution. One-on-one online interviews were audio recorded with fourteen (n = 14) students from second to fourth year and were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed through content analysis. Results: Two main themes emerged: (1) Maintaining balance in the new ‘normal’; (2) Enablers for an inclusive learning environment. The change in the method of teaching has highlighted the requirements for adequate teaching and learning. The students in the study were of the view that they deserve an equal opportunity to quality online education. Conclusion: The study reveals that the participants were concerned about the transition from face-to-face lectures to the online system. They felt they were required to adjust without adequate consideration of the prerequisites for the process, such as devices and data availability. Implications for practice: Radiography is both technical and theoretical. Therefore, the integration of online teaching and learning could be used to enhance digital literacy within the South African context. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Research on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on data from community samples. This study sought to understand the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women with histories of clinically elevated symptoms of depression. Methods: Participants included 60 perinatal women who participated in wellness intervention trials for women with antenatal depression. We used a mixed methods approach, assessing depression, anxiety, stressors and coping behaviors, along with narrative responses to questions regarding COVID-specific effects on mental health. Results: Over three-fourths of the sample indicated a worsening of mental health during the pandemic, with 31.7% of women endorsing clinically elevated depression symptoms and 36.7% screening positive for anxiety. Women reported negative impacts on their emotional wellbeing, especially a resurgence of mental health symptoms. Participants also articulated positive experiences during the pandemic, including an appreciation for increased time with family, especially infants. Women detailed numerous, mostly adaptive, coping strategies they had used to mitigate stress; self-isolation and spending time outdoors were associated with having depression above or below the clinical cut off, respectively. Limitations: The study had a small sample, and the generalizability of findings may be limited, given that participants were clinical trial completers. Conclusions: Although the pandemic upended many aspects of life for perinatal women and raised mental health concerns, many also reported adaptive means of coping and positive experiences or ‘silver linings’ related to pandemic restrictions. Some coping strategies that were utilized, including wellness-based behaviors, may have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related stress. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing reliance on digital technology to carry out social, entertainment, work and school activities increased, which may have affected the ways in which parents mediated their children's digital technology use. Given the prominent role that digital technology will have in the future, it is important to investigate parent and child characteristics which impacted parental mediation of children's digital technology use. Therefore, the present study aimed at analysing the frequency of parental mediation strategies (i.e. active and restrictive) during lockdown, their determinants, and how the two strategies affected children's digital skills and time spent online. Data were collected from 461 parent and 461 child participants. Results showed that almost half of parents (46%) practiced parental mediation with the same frequency, while the 42.6% applied it more often. Active mediation was predicted by parental worries about online risks, while restrictive mediation was predicted by time spent online by children, parental worries about online risks, parental negative attitudes towards digital technology and parents' digital skills. Children developed more digital skills when their parents applied higher levels of both active and restrictive mediation, and they spent the lowest amount of time online when their parents employed higher levels of restrictive and lower levels of active mediation. Practical implications for families and children's wellbeing are discussed. © 2021

AB  - Given the profound role that media play in public opinion, there exists an ongoing necessity to understand the portrayal of mental illness by journalists. There is a plethora of studies that have examined how mental illness is portrayed in the media, but few studies have sought to understand what journalist opinions about mental illness are, and none could be found regarding journalism students’ opinions. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining journalism student’s attitudes towards mental illness using the Social Distance Scale (SDS). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate journalism students (n = 172) completed the SDS with findings suggesting that students had moderate stigmatizing attitudes, with varying degrees of stigma present depending on the social context. Positively framed reporting and constructive media coverage surrounding mental illness may be improved by shared communication and education with health professionals who specialize in mental health: mental health nurses. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the current study was to explore physical activity (PA) levels, exercise preferences, and perceived barriers to PA in childhood cancer survivors. Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed 120 childhood cancer survivors aged 8–18 years from the pediatric oncology center in South Korea between March and August 2017. The modified Exercise & Quality of Life questionnaire, Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, and Godin Leisure-Time Questionnaire were used to assess PA levels, preferences, and exercise barriers. Results: Among 120 participants (72 boys, 48 girls) whose average age at the time of the survey was 14.57 ± 3.00 years and the average age at diagnosis was 8.22 years, the three most common diagnoses were acute leukemia (43.3%), brain tumor (13.3%), and malignant lymphoma (10.8%). Only 16 participants (5%) met the PA recommendations for children (at least 60 min of moderate PA per day). The most preferred sporting activities included soccer, basketball, strengthening exercises, badminton, dance, and taekwondo. They generally had positive attitudes toward exercise, and more than 63% of participants intended to exercise the following month. The five most prevalent perceived barriers to exercise were lack of time, poor health, reluctance to sweat, lack of exercise skills, and no exercise partners. Conclusions: While most childhood cancer survivors did not meet the PA recommendation, most of them agreed that exercise was beneficial, and they intended to participate in the exercise. Exercise and PA programs should be tailored to the personal health and preferences of childhood cancer survivors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - With the tourism and hospitality sector reopening post-lockdown of COVID-19, the recovery of customers' purchase intentions is essential to reboot the sector. This study aims to examine the relationship between social distancing measures and purchase intentions in the UK's restaurant and hotel sectors using a propensity score weighting experimental design method. The findings suggest that the impact of social distancing measures on purchase intentions is mediated by the trust in the targeted restaurant and hotel. Risk tolerance significantly moderates the influence of social distancing measures on trust; (non-) cash promotions have an insignificant impact on purchase intentions. The introduction of the propensity score weighting scheme addresses the endogeneity caused by the sampling bias in non-probability sampling experiment studies. © 2021

AB  - Awareness of the genetic counseling (GC) profession may influence access to genetic services, yet awareness among the U.S. population is unknown. A survey of U.S. adults was conducted using age- and sex-based quotas. Participants were asked if they had heard of the GC profession and to describe what genetic counselors (GCs) do. After reading a brief description of what GCs do, participants were asked the likelihood they would request to see a genetic counselor if they were concerned about a genetic condition. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the population, logistic regression to determine factors related to awareness of the GC profession, and ordinary least squares regression to identify which factors correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services. Thematic analysis was used to code open-ended responses. Among the final sample of 543, the majority were White individuals (79.7%) with an average age of 46.5 and median income between $60,000 and $69,999. Although 20% indicated they had heard of the GC profession, further analysis of the qualitative follow-up question suggested only 13.4% understood the role of GCs (CI 10.6%–16.3%). Factors positively and significantly correlated with knowledge of the GC profession included identifying as White or female and having higher educational attainment or higher science knowledge after controlling for income, age, and political views. Approximately 45% of respondents indicated they would likely or very likely seek GC if concerned about a genetic condition. Biological sex, age, religious affiliation, science knowledge, and awareness of the GC profession were significantly correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services while controlling for race, income, educational attainment, and political views. Curiosity/interest, the perception of benefits, and trust in GCs were all major themes that emerged to explain reasons for seeking an appointment with GCs. Lack of awareness, lack of perceived benefit, and lack of trust in GCs or greater trust in other healthcare providers were reasons for not wanting a GC appointment. Despite the 50-year existence of the GC profession, awareness remains low and negative attitudes exist. © 2021 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB  - A stochastic model estimated the consequences of a COVID-19 super spreader event occurring in the local municipality of Stavanger, Norway as a result of a night on the town. The model imposed different infection control regulations and compared these different scenarios. For Stavanger’s 161 locations of service, secondary transmissions from a super spreader event was estimated to infect a median of 37, requiring the quarantining of 200 guests given no infection control regulations, 23 and 167 when imposing social distancing regulations and other hygienic infection control measures, 7 infected and 63 quarantined guests with restrictions placed on the guest capacity, and 4 infected and 57 quarantined guests with both forms of restriction in use. © Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Genomic Sequencing (GS) to identify high cancer risk will soon enter clinical practice at significant cost to the health system. This study aimed to quantify perceived value of GS to Australian cancer patients and their first-degree relatives participating in a genomic sequencing study, and factors associated with value. Participants were recruited upon consent to the genomics study. Eligible participants (with cancer of likely genetic etiology, or a first-degree relative) completed a questionnaire prior to GS. Willingness to pay was assessed via hypothetical trade-off scenarios of actionable result return rates of 1%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%. Of 348 probands and 213 relatives (92% and 93% response rate), 81% would consistently have GS for as little as a 1% actionable return rate. Participants would pay a median of $1,000 for return rates of at least 20% (probands) or 30% (relatives), and $300 for lower return rates. Probands with common cancers and negative attitudes to uncertainty were more likely to have GS; those with higher education were more willing to pay $1,000 and $3,000 for lower return rates. This study found high interest in, but lower willingness to pay for GS in cancer patients and their first-degree relatives, possibly due to inability to pay. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of how individuals in different risk circumstances, trade-off the risks, harms, and benefits of GS. © 2021 National Society of Genetic Counselors.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused both physical and psychological changes in the general public. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between well-being and coping strategies in response to the pandemic. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the mediational role of benefit finding. A total of 521 participants aged 18–65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation-specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well-being were assessed 1 month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well-being, while social distancing negatively predicted well-being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice and benefit finding with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that besides adopting adaptive coping strategies to prevent infection by COVID-19, individuals should be encouraged to recognize benefits associated with the COVID-19 outbreak. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - We examined stress as a predictor of behaviours related to Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) through its effects on delay discounting. Adults (N = 3686) completed an online survey with a behavioural measure of delay discounting and questions regarding stress, physical distancing, and stockpiling of food and supplies. Stress was weakly, but positively, correlated with delay discounting (p < 0.01). Delay discounting was positively correlated with stockpiling (p < 0.01); and discounting was negatively correlated with physical distancing (p < 0.01). Mediation models indicated that discounting was a significant mediator of the relationship between stress and physical distancing (−0.003) and stockpiling (0.003); bootstrap 95% CIs (−0.006, −0.001) and (0.001, 0.005), respectively. After accounting for its indirect effects through discounting, stress continued to have a direct effect on these outcomes. This study indicates that delay discounting partially mediates the link between stress and behaviours related to COVID-19. Results suggest that interventions reducing stress and/or delay discounting may be profitable for increasing infection prevention and reducing stockpiling. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This research aimed to provide a more nuanced understanding of the relations between social norms, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), outgroup-directed prejudice, and hostile behavioral intentions toward outgroups. Three correlational studies, conducted in two countries and three different intergroup contexts (n1 = 997; n2 = 1011; n3 = 1992), investigated the moderating role of social norms (both positive and negative) on the relation between RWA and expression of prejudice as well as behavioral intentions toward outgroups. We found that in the presence of positive (i.e., tolerant) social norms, the previously well-established positive relation between RWA and prejudice is reduced or even reversed, whereas in the presence of negative (i.e., intolerant) social norms, this relation is strengthened. Additionally, the lower (vs. higher) prejudice of high-RWA individuals in the presence of positive (vs. negative) social norms mediated the link between RWA and behavioral intentions toward outgroups. The present research constitutes the first comprehensive demonstration of authoritarians' potential to be less prejudiced in response to prevailing tolerant social norms. © 2021 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ((2002–2015) CBS, Alliance Atlantis Communications, CBS Paramount Network Television, Jerry Bruckheimer Television.) marks a paradigm shift in the post-9/11 forensic visual culture, ostensibly presenting physical evidence as a system of surveillance and control; the team of criminalists as ideologically complicit with state power; and high-tech forensic gadgetry as infallible and conducive to the culprit. In the melodramatic narrative strands, sophisticated plotlines, and spectacular performances of forensic science, CSI heavily rests on a novel and meticulously elaborated aesthetics that redefines the conception of gaze and camera shot in the weaving of episodes across the different seasons. A more nuanced comprehension of CSI’s visual forensic discourse is, therefore, necessitated to fully understand the cultural significance of these offerings. To this end, extending the work of Kress and Van Leuween on the systems of gaze and social distance in light of the Foucauldian and post-panoptic views on power and control, the article introduces fine-grained taxonomies of the forensic gaze and camera shot as fundamental aesthetics closely tied to post-9/11 extensive surveillance discourse. Resituating CSI in the broader context of the post-panopticon, the study argues that the drama series operates in a hybrid surveillance mode that surpasses conventional readings of panopticism, straddling the line between the physical and the digital in the contemporary age. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Although tattoos have increased in popularity, they may put individuals at a disadvantage when seeking employment. Drawing on the justification-suppression model and the stereotype content model, we propose that job applicants with visible tattoos experience prejudice in hiring and starting salary recommendations because they are stereotyped as less competent and warm than those without visible tattoos. In Study 1, we compared equally qualified Caucasian female applicants in their mid to late 20s with no visible tattoos, a mild visible tattoo, and extreme visible tattoos for the position of a sales manager. Tattooed applicants were less likely to be hired, especially if they had extreme visible tattoos, and were offered lower salaries and rated lower on competence (but not warmth) than applicants without visible tattoos. Furthermore, competence mediated the relationship between visible tattoos and hiring and salary recommendations. In Study 2, we examined if young Caucasian female applicants with visible tattoos can overcome prejudice through their job qualifications and found they were able to mitigate salary discrimination, but not hiring discrimination by being highly qualified. In Study 3, we proposed that young Caucasian female applicants with visible tattoos can neutralize discrimination by being highly qualified and having volunteer experience. However, volunteering did not mitigate prejudice related to visible tattoos. Our findings suggest that it is difficult for applicants with visible tattoos to overcome discrimination. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual’s behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India. © 2021, Korean Society for Informatics and Computational Applied Mathematics.

AB  - What is known on the subject: The meaning in life consists of an individual's values, experiences, goals and beliefs. It has been shown to be negatively associated with depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. Depression and hopelessness are related to increased suicidal ideation. Meaning in life has been shown to be a protective factor against depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. What the paper adds to existing knowledge: A path model was developed to clarify the associations among meaning in life, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. For clarity, the outcomes were depression and suicidal ideation, the independent variable was hopelessness, and the mediator was meaning in life. Hopelessness had a direct association with meaning in life, and meaning in life had a direct association with depression, supporting the mediating effect of meaning in life from hopelessness to depression. Meaning in life had the strongest association with depression, and depression had the strongest association with suicidal ideation. Meaning in life did not have a significant direct association with suicidal ideation; it did have an indirect association with suicidal ideation through depression. This study estimated that one-point increase in meaning in life score was associated with 0.47-point decrease in depression score and 0.13-point decrease in suicidal ideation score, respectively. What are the implications for practice: Logotherapy is a meaning-centred therapy to find meaning in life. This study reveals that increased levels of meaning in life are associated with decreasing degrees of depression. Mental health nurses could help patients to find meaning in life by logotherapy and thus associated with reductions in depression. Mental health nurses could help patients to find hope by exploring meaning in life and promoting positive attitudes towards life from meaningless life to meaningful life, there is a reduction in depression, which in turn reduces suicidal ideation indirectly. Abstract: Introduction Meaning in life can be good protective factor against depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. Aim To analyse the mediating effect of meaning in life on the associations among hopelessness, depression and suicidal ideation. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted among 90 patients diagnosed with depression. A structural equation modelling approach was applied for this path analysis to examine the mediating effect of meaning in life on the association among hopelessness, depression and suicidal ideation. Results The results showed that meaning in life mediated the association between hopelessness and depression. Hopelessness had a direct positive association with depression (β = 0.23, p <.03), and meaning in life had a direct negative association with depression (β = −0.51, p <.01) and indirect association with suicidal ideation through depression; this indirect association was −0.21 (p <.01). Discussion Meaning in life revealed strong mediating association with the relationship between hopelessness and depression. By reducing the level of depression, meaning in life demonstrated its mediator association with suicidal ideation. Implications for Practice Logotherapy is a meaning-centred therapy to find meaning in life. Mental health nurses could help patients to manage their depression through logotherapy, thus leading to reductions in suicidal ideation. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists are a high-risk group for COVID-19. Although the implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection on physical health are well-documented, the psychological impact is frequently overlooked. Aims: The aim of this study was to gauge the psychological impact of COVID-19 on ENT specialists in Ireland. Methods: A national, cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed to ENT specialists during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (21st May 2020–21st June 2020). The questionnaire collected sociodemographic and COVID-19 related data. The GAD-7 was utilized to measure symptoms of clinically significant anxiety disorder. Results: Thirty-eight ENT specialists (M/F:24/12, median age, 38.7 years (23–60 years)) completed the survey. About 34% (n = 13) of participants screened positive for an anxiety disorder, of which 2 (5%) had moderate symptoms. The majority of participants (n = 32, 84%) felt ENT specialists had increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared with other medical specialties. Additionally, 32% (n = 12) felt incapable of protecting themselves from infection. An encouraging proportion of ENT specialists (n = 22, 58%) were aware of psychological support available from national and institutional organizations. Conclusions: The long-term psychological sequelae of COVID-19 will be felt as the physical burden eases. As we adjust to new normalities, ENT surgeons must be conscientious of the mental health issues that arise from the working environment. Sources of anxiety emanated from a lack of control over infection risk, increased vulnerability to COVID-19 relative to other specialties and the implications this has for ENT specialists and their families. Future interventions must focus on increasing awareness of the available psychological support services for our healthcare workers. © 2021, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.

AB  - Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies are divisive issues in American politics. These attitudes are influenced by factors such as political orientation and religiousness, with religious and conservative individuals demonstrating higher prejudice toward immigrants and refugees, and endorsing stricter immigration policies. Christian nationalism, an ideology marked by the belief that America is a Christian nation, may help explain how religious nationalist identity influences negative attitudes toward immigrants. The current research addresses this through four studies among participants in the US. Across studies, our results showed that Christian nationalism was a significant and consistent predictor of anti-immigrant stereotypes, prejudice, dehumanization, and support for anti-immigrant policies. These effects were robust to inclusion of other sources of anti-immigrant attitudes, including religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and political ideology. Further, perceived threats from immigrants mediated the relationship between Christian nationalism and dehumanization of immigrants, and attitudes toward immigration policies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relations between religious nationalism and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy in the US, as well as in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens’ attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self–group distancing coping strategy in terms of an “ironic” procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat “dark side” of procedural fairness. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the spread of Covid-19 is giving rise to an exceptional social situation because of the great speed of propagation of the illness and the high level of mortality it has occasioned in a very short time. Moreover, the lockdown measures decreed in Spain prohibit the holding of wakes to avoid contagion, and limit funerals to three people plus the officiant. Thus, coronavirus is robbing people of the opportunity of a final farewell, stripping the dead of their dignity and worsening the grief of the living. This article investigates the situation and the social and cultural impact it has provoked. The method used takes the line of critical dialogue analysis (CDA) applied to information contained in the mass media, employing qualitative material from a related small-scale study. The results show that in countries like Spain where there is a strong Roman Catholic tradition the importance of these rituals is unquestionable. Although the country has become laicized over recent years, many traditions around death are still maintained. Hence, the impossibility of holding funerals is triggering a large number of social and personal conflicts. Furthermore, they indicate that lockdown, and the lack of rituals and of accompaniment constitute some of the most crucial stressors in the epidemic. Grief in solitude has become widespread and all the more fundamental in a society that values social support from close friends and family members. The conclusions show that the social distancing imposed by the epidemic is especially hard to bear when relatives are passing into death. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The growing interest in sustainable development in all sectors of the economy has fostered a noteworthy shift toward responsible management education (RME). This emerging view underscores that business schools provide students with more than just managerial knowledge as they also develop students toward responsible management. Based on socialization theory, we show how this development occurs by studying RME as a process that relates to students’ values, attitudes and behavioral intentions. With data from a large international survey of business students from 21 countries, our findings show that RME facilitates students’ self-transcendence, the development of conservation values and positive attitudes toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). Further, RME is positively related to students’ CSR behavioral intentions (willingness to sacrifice salary to work for a responsible employer) through the mediating role of values and attitudes. In sum, this study extends socialization theory to the higher education domain to show that business schools can affect students’ prosocial, ethical values and intentions, with implications for responsible management and RME. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate social media posts regarding pilon fractures and its relationship to patient injury perception. We evaluated Instagram media posts in patients who have suffered pilon fractures for the following variables: gender, tone, discussion of rehabilitation, activities of daily living (ADL) reference, incision/scar reference, pain, post of radiograph/imaging, external fixation reference, discussion of bracing/splinting, pre- or postoperative swelling, and need for reoperation. Results were determined by comparing each variable to gender and tone of the post to study patient injury perception. Methods: Public Instagram posts from within a 1-year time period were isolated and evaluated using the hashtag “#pilonfracture.” Individual posts were analyzed by authors. In total, 241 patient posts were included for investigation and analysis of patient injury perception via social media. Results: Of all included posts, 88% of posts had a positive tone. A majority of the posts (66.8%) mentioned rehabilitation and postoperative progress. There were significant associations between positive tone and rehabilitation (P =.0001), as well as positive tone and ADLs (P =.0361). Conclusion: Reported outcomes after surgical management of pilon fractures are generally poor. Nonetheless, this analysis of patients sharing their experience on social media after open reduction internal fixation of pilon fractures demonstrates a mostly positive attitude toward the injury and recovery. A positive tone of the post was significantly associated with mentions of rehabilitation and ADLs. Levels of Evidence: Level III: Retrospective comparative study © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Right-wing populists are gaining ground in Western democracies. Surveys show that they often distrust established media and public service media (PSM) in particular, claiming that they are biased against them. This paper examines how they have challenged PSM and proposes some potential responses to these challenges. The paper is based on an analysis of a number of recent and long-standing surveys of public attitudes towards the media, combined with an analysis of support for right-wing populists. It focuses on three purposively sampled national case studies: Austria, Germany and Sweden. We show several commonalities among PSM in these three countries, including similar right-wing populist attacks on PSM. The findings crystallise around two points: First, the impartiality and objectivity of news media has generally become less taken-for-granted in a ‘high-choice’ media environment offering various news products of different quality. Secondly, historical left-right distinctions have become less clear-cut, also because right-wing populists challenge them. Consequently, the role of PSM in creating a shared national conversation which represents the diversity of society has also come under siege. At the same time, partisan websites and social media platforms enable certain groups to showcase content that is more aligned with the perspectives of right-wing populists. The paper concludes by asking if right-wing populists are a growing threat to PSM and whether this threat is isolated or potentially indicative of a broader and more sustained pattern. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Due to the recent conflicts between China and South Korea (mainly the THAAD incident), we intended to examine whether mediated intergroup contact through TV series and films can be beneficial for improving their intergroup relations. Moreover, a novel type of indirect intergroup contact was proposed and termed as extended mediated contact. The general objective is to investigate and differentiate its relationships with intergroup relations (i.e. intergroup attitudes and post-conflict forgiveness) with those of mediated contact. Chinese university students were selected as the sample of our study and 366 participants completed an online survey. Results from the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that both mediated and extended mediated contact positively predicted cultural affinity, which, in turn, positively predicted both intergroup attitudes and post-conflict forgiveness. As compared to mediated contact, extended mediated contact exerted significant but weaker effects. The bootstrapping method in SEM revealed that cultural affinity played a mediating role in the relationships of the two types of contact to intergroup attitudes and forgiveness. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - At present, there have been a number of studies examining the sexualization of female characters in various media. However, most studies to date have not clearly delineated whether sexualized images or the presence of assertive versus passive female characters influences negative attitudes toward women in viewers, as well as female viewer anxiety. The present study investigated whether the inclusion of powerful female characters in movies with sexualized content influences both male and female viewers’ attitudes towards women as well as anxiety responses of female reviewers. Participants included 134 undergraduate students attending a private liberal arts university in the southern region of the United States. Participants were randomized to watch one of three movie conditions: first, movies that involve strong female lead characters, but which also include sexualized characters, Second, movies that involve strong female lead characters without sexualization and third, movies that involve sexualized female characters without strong portrayals (i.e. damsels in distress). Participants were measured on attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance and anxiety. Results indicated little support for the view that sexualized media impacted viewers’ attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance or anxiety. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the past three decades, scholars have frequently used the concept of framing effects to assess the competence of citizens' political judgments and how susceptible they are to elite influence. Yet prior framing studies have reached mixed conclusions, and few have provided systematic cumulative evidence. This study evaluates the overall efficacy of different types of framing effects in the political domain by systematically meta-analyzing this large and diverse literature. A combined analysis of 138 experiments reveals that when examined across contexts, framing exerts medium-sized effects on citizens' political attitudes and emotions. However, framing effects on behavior are negligible, and small effects are also found in more realistic studies employing frame competition. These findings suggest that although elites can influence citizens by framing issues, their capacity to do so is constrained. Overall, citizens appear to be more competent than some scholars envision them to be. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - As part of the social distancing measures for preventing the spread of COVID-19, many university courses were moved online. There is an assumption that online teaching limits opportunities for fostering interpersonal relationships and students’ satisfaction of the basic need for relatedness – reflected by experiencing meaningful interpersonal connections and belonging – which are considered important prerequisites for student motivation and vitality. In educational settings, an important factor affecting students’ relatedness satisfaction is the teachers’ behavior. Although research suggests that relatedness satisfaction may be impaired in online education settings, to date no study has assessed how university lecturers’ relatedness support might be associated with student relatedness satisfaction and therefore, student motivation and vitality. This study tested this mediating relationship using data collected during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also investigated whether the relations were moderated by a high affiliation motive which reflects a dispositional wish for positive and warm relationships. The possible importance of the communication channel selected by the lecturers (video chat yes/no) and the format of a class (lecture/seminar) were also investigated. In a sample of N = 337 students, we tested our hypotheses using structural equation model (SEM). Results confirmed mediation, but not moderation. The use of video chat (video call) seems to facilitate the provision of relatedness support but our data did not show that the format of a class was associated with relatedness. Our findings indicate that both teaching behavior and the technical format used to deliver lectures play important roles in student experiences with online classes. The results are discussed in light of other research conducted during the pandemic. Copyright © 2022 Capon-Sieber, Köhler, Alp Christ, Helbling and Praetorius.

AB  - In today’s vast digital landscape, people are constantly exposed to threatening language, which attracts attention and activates the human brain’s fear circuitry. However, to date, we have lacked the tools needed to identify threatening language and track its impact on human groups. To fill this gap, we developed a threat dictionary, a computationally derived linguistic tool that indexes threat levels from mass communication channels. We demonstrate this measure’s convergent validity with objective threats in American history, including violent conflicts, natural disasters, and pathogen outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the dictionary offers predictive insights on US society’s shifting cultural norms, political attitudes, and macroeconomic activities. Using data from newspapers that span over 100 years, we found change in threats to be associated with tighter social norms and collectivistic values, stronger approval of sitting US presidents, greater ethnocentrism and conservatism, lower stock prices, and less innovation. The data also showed that threatening language is contagious. In all, the language of threats is a powerful tool that can inform researchers and policy makers on the public’s daily exposure to threatening language and make visible interesting societal patterns across American history. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: The aims of this paper are to explore the rise of cyberhate on the Zoom video conferencing platform at the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine victimized cases of Zoombombing where it was used as a cyberhate tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only impacted our lives and modes of working and studying, but also created new environments for cybercriminals to engage in cybercrime, cyberhate and hacking by exploiting tools such as Zoom. This new phenomenon called “Zoombombing” was first reported in mid-March 2020, when the social distancing and stay-at-home policies in the United States were nationally introduced. Design/methodology/approach: This research conducted a news media content analysis on cases of Zoombombing. To conduct this analysis empirically, a dataset with all of the reported Zoombombing cases from March to April 2020 was created. Google Trends, news media and tweets were used to analyze Zoombombing as a form of cyberhate, particularly digital racism. Findings: The results reveal prevalent Zoom-mediated racism toward Asian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans. This study understands Zoombombing from a sociopolitical/cultural perspective through news reporting of victimized cases and explores various ways that Zoombombing shapes, mediates, transforms and escalates racism. Originality/value: This study is one of the very first studies to analyze Zoombombing in a way that builds upon an emerging body of literature on cyberhate. This paper considers Zoom as a space where curious young people, cybercriminals, extremists and hackers impose their ideologies and beliefs upon newly established online learning and working environments and engage in a struggle for identity recognition in the midst of increasingly accessible vulnerable software and cyberspace. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - To facilitate effective targeted COVID-19 vaccination strategies, it is important to understand reasons for vaccine hesitancy where uptake is low. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer an opportunity for real-time analysis of public attitudes, sentiments, and key discussion topics from sources of soft-intelligence, including social media data. In this work, we explore the value of soft-intelligence, leveraged using AI, as an evidence source to support public health research. As a case study, we deployed a natural language processing (NLP) platform to rapidly identify and analyse key barriers to vaccine uptake from a collection of geo-located tweets from London, UK. We developed a search strategy to capture COVID-19 vaccine related tweets, identifying 91,473 tweets between 30 November 2020 and 15 August 2021. The platform's algorithm clustered tweets according to their topic and sentiment, from which we extracted 913 tweets from the top 12 negative sentiment topic clusters. These tweets were extracted for further qualitative analysis. We identified safety concerns; mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies; and accessibility issues as key barriers limiting vaccine uptake. Our analysis also revealed widespread sharing of vaccine misinformation amongst Twitter users. This study further demonstrates that there is promising utility for using off-the-shelf NLP tools to leverage insights from social media data to support public health research. Future work to examine where this type of work might be integrated as part of a mixed-methods research approach to support local and national decision making is suggested.

AB  - Face masks (FM) play a role in limiting the spread of viral infections; despite this, their role is influenced by the population's adherence to wearing the FM. However, the impact on the effectiveness of the FM is variable in various communities. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward FM use during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. This observational “cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.” The data was collected using an online questionnaire survey from September 8–21, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices using single choice questions and a five-point Likert scale. Among 1,356, respondents' the rate was 678 (50%), 207 (30.5%) were males and 471 (69.5%) females. Among the participants, Saudi citizens were (649; 95.7%), with University education (502; 74%) and were mostly (368; 54.3%) between 16 and 24 years of age. The participants (384; 56.6%, p < 0.001) had good knowledge about face masks, and more than half of the respondents, 531 (78.3%) (p < 0.001), showed a positive attitude. Most of the respondents (477, 70.2%) believed that everyone could use the face mask to minimize the spread of the disease; however (111; 16.4%) reported that they would not wear a face mask if the government did not recommend wearing it in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic. Saudi citizens have above-average knowledge and optimistic attitudes toward using face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The community is convinced about the face masks and believes that face masks play a predominant role in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Purpose: Purpose of this study is to investigate the role of learner readiness in enhancing transfer of training by empirically testing a moderated mediation mechanism in which learner readiness influences transfer through motivation to transfer, and this indirect impact is moderated by supervisor support. Design/methodology/approach: The perception of trainees about the constructs considered has been captured through a survey of 250 employees of a unit of a manufacturing organization in India. For hypotheses testing, PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013) has been used. Findings: Results have confirmed the significant role played by learner readiness in predicting transfer. This apart, supervisor support has been proved to moderate the indirect impact of learner readiness on transfer. Practical implications: Trainees need to have pre-requisite knowledge to learn the content of a training programme, which would enable them to grasp such content and transfer the same subsequently to work. It is also essential that trainees are willing to attend any training voluntarily. Specific interventions may be designed for supervisors to bolster their catalytic role in training transfer. Originality/value: An interactionist approach has been adopted by focussing on learner readiness as a less-studied trainee characteristic and supervisor support as a situational factor of transfer. This is construed as a significant contribution of this study to training literature. The potential overlap between learner readiness and motivation to transfer as trainee characteristics is seen to be neutralized by the presence of supervisor support as a moderator. Findings help in understanding how a trainee’s readiness and motivation, together with supervisor’s positive attitude, can enhance transfer. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Consumers mainly acquire information through social learning in online shopping environment, and social presence as a media attribute generated by real-time interactions in live streaming commerce is more conducive for consumers’ social learning. Therefore, it is worth investigating the roles of social presence and social learning on consumers’ purchase intention (PI) in the strong interactive environment. Based on social cognitive theory (SCT) framework and drawing on social presence theory and social learning theory, this study investigates the relationships among social presence, social learning process, and PI. Social presence is operationalized into social presence of others (SPO) and social presence of interactions (SPI), whereas social learning process contains external interaction process [exploitative learning (ETL) and exploratory learning (ERL)] and internal psychological process [cognitive appraisal (CAP) and affective appraisal AAP)]. The results from a survey of 372 consumers of live streaming commerce indicate that SPO and SPI positively affect ETL and ERL and then contribute significantly to the building of CAP and AAP, which can lead to PI. The findings also provide guidance for brand managers and retailers in building more effective interactive atmosphere and promoting consumers’ positive attitude toward brands in live streaming marketing.

AB  - Purpose: To discover how UK academic libraries sought to support student mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The data was from a 24-question survey of UK universities distributed in May 2021 which received 56 responses from 47 different Higher Education Institution libraries. Descriptive statistics are combined with thematic analysis of open text comments. Findings: Libraries were undertaking a wide range of activities, targeted chiefly at students and broadcast via Twitter, other social media and library web sites. The problem being addressed was the stresses of studying in the context of the pivot online and isolation caused by social distancing. Digital well-being seemed also to be an increased concern. COVID-19 had proved the value of digital support but created a number of challenges such as loss of physical space, communication barriers and lack of extra resource. The role had a somewhat informal place in the organisation. Overall library activities were aligned but not strongly integrated into institutional efforts. Research limitations/implications: This was a study in one specific national context with a relatively limited number of total responses. There could be a non-response bias where respondents were doing more than was typical in the sector. Originality/value: The paper is one of the first papers to gather sector wide data and move beyond case studies of what individual libraries due to support to mental health and well-being. It also offers a case study of the impacts of COVID-19 on management pointing to its catalysing the digital shift, creating constraints on resources and communication and prompting the emergence of staff well-being as a consideration in management decision making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to measure the level of public awareness about the threat of the emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among the Omani population. It also aims to investigate the mediating effect of the Omanis’ attitudes and behaviors with underlying conditions of COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data via an online survey of Omani citizens and residents from various geographic areas in Oman, 305 responses were received. SPSS and partial least square-structural equation modeling were used for data analysis. Findings: The study revealed that public awareness regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly influenced by people’s perceived risk, information source and health-related knowledge. Further, preventive behavior during the disease spread has a significant direct and indirect impact on their awareness. However, an insignificant mediation effect of public attitude was found between the source of information and public awareness. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited by the scarcity of related literature in the Omani context. It is recommended that future research complete an in-depth study of public awareness regarding COVID-19, using other constructs and/or other data collection techniques. Practical implications: This research will provide governmental health authorities and policymakers with a guideline to establish more efficient pandemic containment strategies to control public behavior toward the COVID-19 pandemic and curb viral prevalence. Social implications: This research will help in improving prevention measures against COVID-19 are recommended to be more educated through a more effective mechanism to raise public attitude regarding pandemic prevalence positively. Originality/value: The originality of this research can be drawn from key findings that indicate that people overall gained knowledge about how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and the accuracy of information significantly impacts public awareness. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The covid-19 pandemic has impacted the health and well-being of millions across the globe. Strict social distancing policies and periodic lockdowns has led to an increased reliance on alternative online means of communication, including social media. Objectives: to examine (i) social media use and mental health in the general population 9 months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and (ii) mental health in relation to motives for and extent of social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Methods: A cross-national online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia. Participants (n = 3,474) reported extent of and motives for social media use and completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The data were analyzed by chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis. Results: Poorer mental health was associated with using social media to decrease loneliness and for entertainment motives, while better mental health was associated with using social media for personal contact and maintaining relationships. Overall increased daily time on social media was associated with poorer mental health. The social media use variables were responsible for a substantial proportion of the outcome variance explained. These findings were consistent across the four countries, with only minor variations. Conclusions: Motives for using, and time spent using, social media were associated with the participants' mental health. Guidance and recommendations for social media usage to the general public for prevention and intervention for behavioral health may be beneficial.

The first study tested the mediating role of biogenetic, psychosocial, societal, and personal attributions on the relationship between interconnectedness and social distance from people with schizophrenia. In the second study, an experiment with four conditions was employed to test the incremental effects of societal and personal attributions over biopsychosocial attribution. Study 1 showed interconnectedness is associated with less social distance only through personal attribution. Study 2 found levels of personal advocacy differ between pre and postexperiment among four conditions across time. Public responsibility at postexperiment mediated the relationship between conditions involving personal attribution and less social distance and greater personal advocacy at 2-week followup. These studies highlight the importance of accounting for societal factors and reminding all members of the society their interconnectedness to achieve stigma reduction. © 2022.

AB  - Objective To use the digital story completion method to prompt participants to describe thoughts, fears and mental health experiences in response to a story stem about COVID-19, to capture a specific sociohistoric moment. Design We used digital story completion, a qualitative research method, to gather narratives from Australians coping with physical distancing and social restriction measures. Our reflexive thematic analysis of the data was underpinned by a constructionist approach to reflect the importance of social context in understanding health experiences. Setting Australia. Participants 52 people living in Australia (aged 18 years and over). Results Four meta-themes were prevalent across 52 stories submitted: (1) expressions of mental distress linked to COVID-19; (2) various coping strategies offered by characters in stories; (3) narratives outlining social support offered to alleviate distress; and (4) specialised COVID-19 vocabulary. Conclusion We cautiously propose that points of convergence across stories indicate a level of shared experience among participants relating to COVID-19 in Australia. We suggest this is due to intensive media coverage of the pandemic, persistent public health messaging, engagement with social media and instant messaging technologies, and extended lockdowns that impacted the mental health of vast numbers of Australians. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the effects of brand components (CBBE, brand fit, brand image, brand reputation, brand familiarity) on consumers brand portfolio attitude via perceived risk (for two main portfolio strategies). Design/methodology/approach: The study used a structured questionnaire to collect primary data from 636 consumers who made purchases from companies using house of brand (318) and branded house strategy (318). By conducting reliability and validity analysis, the model of this study was tested with confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis methods, using structural equation modeling. Findings: According to the results of the path analysis, the effects of CBBE and brand reputation on brand attitude were confirmed for both house of brand and branded house strategy. Moreover, the full and partial mediating effect of perceived risk was proven in the relationships. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of the study is determining a portfolio of brands for each strategy and collecting data for these brands. In addition, since the number of consumers using brand portfolios could not be reached in the study, data could be collected using the purposeful convenience sampling method. For this reason, it is thought that research conducted with the data obtained through systematic sampling methods can yield more reliable results. Practical implications: Managers of companies with a brand portfolio should work on a main strategy that enhances CBBE and brand reputation regardless of the strategy they use. After these two variables, the variable that portfolio managers need to address is brand fit. Originality/value: It will offer different perspectives in terms of understanding which portfolio strategy is needed, and which predecessors and outputs can be produced. Also, the findings of the research will produce important results to reduce the perceived risks of consumers and increase their positive attitudes toward brand portfolios. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objective This study explored Frontline Health Workers' (FLWs) knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) on COVID-19 and their lived experiences, in both their personal and work lives, at the early stage of the pandemic in Bangladesh. Design, setting and participants This was a qualitative study conducted through telephone interviews in May 2020. A total of 41 FLWs including physicians, nurses, paramedics, community healthcare workers and hospital support staff from 34 public and private facilities of both urban and rural parts of Bangladesh participated in the interview. A purposive sampling technique supplemented by a snowball sampling method was followed to select the participants. The in-depth interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide, and we applied the thematic analysis method for the qualitative data analysis. Findings Except physicians, the FLWs did not receive any institutional training on COVID-19, including its prevention and management, in most instances. Also, they had no training in the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Their common source of knowledge was the different websites or social media platforms. The FLWs were at risk while delivering services because patients were found to hide histories and not maintaining safety rules, including physical distancing. Moreover, inadequate supply of PPE, fear of getting infected, risk to family members and ostracisation by the neighbours were mentioned to be quite common by them. This situation eventually led to the development of mental stress and anxiety; however, they tried to cope up with this dire situation and attend to the call of humanity. Conclusion The uncertain work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic simultaneously affected FLWs' physical and emotional health in Bangladesh. However, they showed professional devotion in overcoming such obstacles and continued to deliver essential services. This could be further facilitated by a quick and targeted training package on COVID-19, and the provision of supplies for delivering services with appropriate safety precautions. ©

AB  - Previous corporate social responsibility (CSR) studies at the employee level have focused on the influence of CSR on employees’ positive attitudes and behavior. However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between CSR and unethical behavior and the underlying mechanism. Based on social information processing theory, this study investigates how CSR affects employee cheating via employees’ organizational identification and perceived supervisor moral decoupling. Additionally, this study discusses the moderating effect of employee bottom-line mentality on these relationships. We test this two-path model using a sample of MBA students in China. The results indicate that both organizational identification and perceived supervisor moral decoupling mediate the relationship between CSR and cheating, and employee bottom-line mentality moderates the effect of CSR on perceived supervisor moral decoupling. Specifically, for employees low in bottom-line mentality, CSR has a significantly negative impact on perceived supervisor moral decoupling, but the same relationship is insignificant for employees with a strong bottom-line mentality. Overall, our results uncover the relationship between CSR and employee cheating and extend the understanding of the influence of CSR on employees. Copyright © 2022 Luan, Lv and Zheng.

AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports. The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok’s campaign have been evaluated. The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok’s campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate–e.g. sweaty, tired–there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - It’s not clear if and how social distancing measures to control COVID-19 transmission may result in more occurrences of child and adolescent abuse perpetrated by their parents. Information often comes from indirect estimates and media reports. More evidence is needed from multiple sources, particularly from the potential victims. The aim of this study was to compare the proportion of violence perpetrated on adolescents by their parents before, during and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Three different samples with adolescents aged 12–18 years were collected before (n = 1444), during (n = 1427) and after (n = 794) the lockdown and compared to verify variations concerning parental violence behaviors. Higher rates of aggressive parental behavior were found, but results showed that adolescents reported a reduction of psychological, physical, and sexual violence perpetrated by their parents during and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Implications and future research needs are discussed. © 2022 Associacao Portuguesa de Psicologia. All rights reserved.

AB  - Addressing the high prevalence of depression among university students and the need to motivate professional help seeking, we examine whether recovery stories featuring a similar – compared to a dissimilar – person sharing their personal experience of coping with depression will reduce stigmatization (attitudes, social distance, prosocial intentions) and the self-stigma of help seeking as mediated by perceived similarity and identification. We conducted a one-factorial between-subject experiment to test the effects of lifestyle similarity on stigmatization and self-stigma of help seeking. 169 students (74.6% female; Mage = 23.5, SD = 3.5) were randomly assigned to read either a recovery story about a similar or dissimilar author’s reflections on their experience of coping with depression or a control story. Contrary to expectations, recovery stories did not reduce stigmatization nor the self-stigma of help seeking, irrespective of whether they were told by a similar or dissimilar person. However, a significant indirect effect on prosocial intentions through perceived similarity and identification as well as several interesting exploratory results point to potential beneficial and detrimental effects of recovery stories and similarity that should be explored in future research. © Freya Sukalla, Ina Krack, Daniel Seibert, Ludwig Paeth, Olga Frank, Ronja Preißler, Philip Matias Block

AB  - Both the ownership and development of sex dolls and robots are passionately debated, with skeptics suspecting that their increasing human-likeness and the accompanying anthropomorphization (i.e., attributing human-likeness) reinforce the objectification of, and hostility toward, women. As empirical data are largely lacking, we scrutinized this hypothesis in a pre-registered study among doll owners (N = 217), comparing two user groups: “toy group” (n = 104; doll as sex toy) and “partner group” (n = 113; doll as partner). We related their objectification tendencies (i.e., seeing women merely as objects, e.g., to promote sexual desire) as well as their hostility toward women, to the anthropomorphization of their doll. Additionally, we collected qualitative data on how participants perceived their doll usage affected their attitudes toward women. The partner group expressed greater levels of hostility and anthropomorphization, moderate in magnitude. Objectification mediated the influence of anthropomorphization on hostility and a higher percentage described a change in attitudes toward women in response to doll use. These data provide the first empirical evidence that the tendency to anthropomorphize dolls is related to negative attitudes toward women. Given the ongoing development of sex robots designed to surpass dolls in human-likeness and anthropomorphization, this finding seems highly significant. © 2022 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to nationwide lockdowns and rigid measures of social distancing in Denmark. Such a situation provides the unique opportunity to study interruptions in training routines and scrutinise the significance of physical attendance, face-to-face interactions and collective engagement for sport and leisure-time physical activity. Drawing on Randall Collins’ micro-sociological theory of ‘Interaction Ritual Chains’, this article focuses on CrossFit–an activity, which is not only known for members’ high-intensity workouts but also for a tight-knit community. Specifically, we explored how CrossFitters in Denmark made sense of and experienced the changes of their leisure practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with 20 CrossFitters recruited from different CrossFit boxes showed that not only activity levels but also emotional energy and group solidarity dropped considerably during COVID-19 as members lacked interactions within the CrossFit boxes which had been crucial for their participation before the pandemic. Notably, new training situations, specifically online workouts, could not replace the highly successful interaction rituals in the CrossFit box, which stresses the significance of face-to-face interactions for continuous leisure-time physical activity. In so doing, this article contributes to discussions about whether online workouts and digitally mediated communities can complement or replace physical training. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The video introduces Hubei Province to the world in the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic stage to erase the prejudiced “Wuhan virus” and “China virus” painted by Western media. Drawing upon MIPVU (the Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universitei), multimodality of metaphors, and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this study analyzes how the Chinese government attempts to reframe Hubei as a place of courage, prosperity and humanity via metaphors like WAR, BRIDGE, HAND and BACK. The benefits and drawbacks of such metaphor usage are also discussed with appropriate contextual and socio-cultural relevancies. The study provides a hands-on practice of the CDA-based analysis of multimodal metaphors and justifies the feasibility of integrating translation, metaphor and semiotic studies through the sociological theory of framing. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The growing need for more stringent methods of safe blood transfusion has engendered blood banks in Brazil. The transfusion appears, then, as an alternative path for blood-related pathologies and their components. Followed by the enforcement of altruistic principles, blood donation has become resistant within society due to its myths and prejudices. Thus, the implementation of public policies became more evident in tracing the social profile of blood donors, and the public power started regulating, supervising and controlling the rational use of blood and blood products. This way, the indices of blood donation in the Unified Health S ystem (SUS) result from various means of interaction with both the potential donor and with the loyal donor, through digital media, school lectures, symposia, congresses and visual media. This process hitched the recruitment to the peculiarities of potential donors, mostly promoted by Health professionals. There is a need to gradually increase such measures to facilitate the donation process, adapting it to the reality of these people, to amplify the number of loyal donors. © 2022 Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - U.S.P..

AB  - Pressure injury is a serious and preventable problem in intensive care units. Translating guidelines into clinical practice can reduce the incidence of pressure injury. Identifying clinical status, barriers and facilitators contribute to guideline implementation. To identify the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pressure injury prevention in Chinese critical care nurses. Secondary data were extracted from a multicentric clinical trial. Knowledge and attitudes toward pressure injury prevention were assessed by a fourteen-item questionnaire. The observed practices were recorded using a case report form. The report complies with the STROBE statement. A total of 950 critical care nurses in 15 hospitals from six provinces of China were investigated. A total of 53.1% of nurses received a median score of 6 points or less. Knowledge regarding the repositioning procedure, risk assessment, and heel pressure injury prevention was insufficient. Over 99% of nurses strongly or somewhat agreed that pressure injury prevention was very important and that they were willing to take measures to prevent pressure injury. A total of 27 781 patient days of pressure injury prevention practice were recorded. Repositioning was the most commonly used prevention measure, followed by support surfaces and prophylactic dressings. A combination of repositioning, support surface, and prophylactic dressing was lacking. Chinese critical nurses showed a low level of knowledge and a positive attitude toward pressure injury prevention. Practices of pressure injury prevention were unsatisfactory. There is a clear gap between the guidelines and clinical practices. The barrier (low-level knowledge) and facilitator (positive attitude) were identified in this study. According to these findings, strategies need to be developed to promote guideline implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - In a prospective cohort study of Latinx adolescents living in an agricultural county in California, we examined perceptions of federal immigration policy and its effects on community and individual wellbeing. From May to December 2017, 565 youth responded to an open-ended item integrated into ongoing surveys. Median age was 14 (range 13–16 years), 53% female, and 94% Latinx. About 12% were immigrants, 71% children of immigrant parents, and 52% had a parent employed in farm work. Most (78%) indicated they directly experienced or observed effects of current federal immigration policies. Adolescents described anti-immigrant sentiment as heightening discrimination, isolation, fear, and mental health changes. They also perceived constraints on future educational and employment opportunities. These findings suggest that the federal immigration policy environment can negatively impact the wellbeing of youth in Latinx communities and that immigration policy should be considered a social determinant of health. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Educational reform is essential. The revolution of multimedia technology and network technology is having a profound impact on the traditional teaching system, teaching methods, and training content. The learner-centered online learning model is rapidly developing. Research shows that, based on new media concepts and technology applications, music teaching platforms can be created and researched through limited forms of music teaching in colleges and universities and new media platforms. The survey results of the practice and role of new media in the process of assisting music teaching in colleges and universities show that most students have a positive attitude towards the new media teaching assistant method in public music courses in colleges and universities and are very interested in this method. Students' aesthetic, analytical, expressive, and collaborative abilities are also enhanced at all levels. The average score of the test class was 8.8 points higher than that of the control class, and the average score was 10.78% higher. The results show that the application of new media in college music teaching is effective. © 2022 Yunzhang Xu.

AB  - Background: The proliferation of information through social media and on other communication networks during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era altered information transfer in many countries. The content of the messages from government officials, media coverage and alternative narratives, affected the level of compliance in adhering to the various health protocols amongst the public. Aim: This article aimed to determine the relationship between the message used, media coverage, alternative narratives, the public’s attitude towards staying at home and their commitment to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic campaign period in Ghana. Setting: A total of 352 respondents was sampled from the Kumasi metropolis. Methods: A survey sample strategy and a convenience sampling technique were used while structural equation modelling with Partial least square (PLS) version 3.0 was used for the analysis. Results: The study revealed that the nature of media coverage employed and the alternative narratives had a significant positive effect on the attitude of the respondents, whilst the content of the message had insignificant effects on the attitude of the public. Finally, the attitude of the people had a significant positive influence on their respective commitment to stay home. Conclusion: Developing countries in Africa need to fight pandemics using purely subsidised health officials or directorates rather than have government-appointed health experts and officials spearheading activities during a pandemic. Contribution: This study contributes to the clear understanding on some COVID-19 misinformation, the distinctive cost it poses to public health delivery in developing economies and the potential strategy of using neutral public health persons to curb the spread of the virus. © 2022.

AB  - The shelter-in-place orders across the U.S. in response to the COVID-19 pandemic forced many relationships once sustained by in-person interaction into remote states through computer-mediated communication (CMC). Work, school, holidays, social engagements, and everyday conversations formerly experienced through rich and contextual in-person interactions instead have taken place on messaging, voice, and video chatting platforms that diminish or altogether lack many social cues and other qualities critical to social interaction. The difficulties feeling connected to one another observed during this period have stressed the need for novel forms of communication that enable deeper interactions. Social biosensing, the interpersonal sharing of physiological information, has shown promise facilitating social connection at a distance. In the present research we document the experiences of nine pairs of friends (N = 18) who navigated living through a shelter-in-place order, reporting on their experiences sharing their electrodermal activity (EDA) in response to short videos. Participants described the artificial and unnatural nature of communicating using typical forms of CMC and a range of interpretations of EDA as both emotional response and as representative of personal characteristics. We implemented a phased approach to study the temporal nature of forming an understanding of unfamiliar yet intimate data like EDA. Our results indicate typologies of meaning-making processes: “stablers”, “broadeners”, and “puzzlers”. We also interpreted our findings through the lens of intersubjectivity, analyzing how analogical apperception and dialogical interaction both play a role in participants’ meaning-making about their own and their partner’s biosensory information. We conclude with implications from this work pertinent to intersubjectivity theorists, social biosensing researchers, and CMC system designers and developers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigates the mediating roles of psychological inflexibility and differential coping strategies on perceived stress and post-traumatic symptoms and growth in the context of COVID-19. Study one recruited 662 participants (54.8% women; Mage = 40.64 years, SD = 13.04) who completed a cross-sectional questionnaire. It was proposed that orientation to the problem, avoidance strategies, psychological inflexibility, and positive attitude were mediators for the positive association between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The fit indices for the path model were excellent: CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.950, RMSEA = 0.057 [90%CI = 0.043–0.081], and SRMS = 0.042. Gender and stressful events encountered had indirect effects on the endogenous variables. In study two, 128 participants (57.8% women; Mage = 42.30, SD = 12.08) were assessed for post-traumatic growth one year later. Psychological inflexibility and orientation acted as mediators between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, a novel path model was constructed in which psychological inflexibility and orientation to the problem as mediators for perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The indices for the path model were excellent: CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.055 [90%CI = 0.001–0.144], and SRMS = 0.49. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and orientation to the problem predicted post-traumatic growth. Specifically, both orientation to the problem (β =.06 [90%CI:.01;.13]) and psychological inflexibility (β =.14 [90%CI:.08;.26]) had an indirect effect on post-traumatic growth. Overall, these results significantly contribute to the literature as orientation to the problem positively predicted PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth one year later while psychological inflexibility predicted PTSD symptoms and less post-traumatic growth one year later. These results underline the importance of assessing both symptomology and psychological growth to determine adaptive coping strategies in specific contexts. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: Self-infrahumanization or perceiving oneself as lacking the experience of uniquely human emotions, and endorsement of Strong Black Woman (SBW) schema, or self-superhumanization, are two forms of dehumanization. Among African American women, SBW schema endorsement is associated with greater negative attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (ATSPPH) and poorer mental health. Self-infrahumanization is associated with fewer adaptive stress responses and poorer well-being. This research examines the relationship between self-infrahumanization and self-superhumanization on ATSPPH and mental health among African American women. We hypothesized that self-infrahumanization and self-superhumanization will be associated with greater negative ATSPPH and greater mental health symptomatology. We also hypothesized that ATSPPH will mediate the interactive effect of selfinfrahumanization and SBW schema endorsement on mental health symptomatology. Method: Four hundred and forty-nine self-identified African American women (Mage = 37.96; SDage = 15.55; age range: 18–87) completed an online, self-administered Qualtrics survey investigating the social and psychological determinants of health. Results: Self-infrahumanization was not associated with mental health symptomatology. Greater SBW schema endorsement was associated with greater mental health symptomatology. Self-infrahumanization and SBW schema endorsement were not associated with ATSPPH. ATSPPH mediated the interaction between SBW and self-infrahumanization on mental health symptomatology. At high and average—but not low—levels of SBW schema endorsement, greater self-infrahumanization was associated with lower positive ATSPPH, which was then associated with greater mental health symptomatology. Conclusions: Among African American women, believing that one lacks the experience of uniquely human emotions exacerbates the negative effects of endorsing SBW schema. We discuss the role of dehumanization processes in health disparities research. © 2022. American Psychological Association

The use of algorithms holds promise for overcoming human biases in decision-making, but they frequently make decisions that discriminate. Media coverage suggests that people are morally outraged by algorithmic discrimination, but here we examine whether people are less outraged by algorithmic discrimination than by human discrimination. Eight studies test this algorithmic outrage deficit hypothesis in the context of gender discrimination in hiring practices across diverse participant groups (online samples, a quasi-representative sample, and a sample of tech workers). We find that people are less morally outraged by algorithmic (vs. human) discrimination and are less likely to hold the organization responsible. The algorithmic outrage deficit is driven by the reduced attribution of prejudicial motivation to algorithms. Just as algorithms dampen outrage, they also dampen praise—companies enjoy less of a reputational boost when their algorithms (vs. employees) reduce gender inequality. Our studies also reveal a downstream consequence of algorithmic outrage deficit—people are less likely to find the company legally liable when the discrimination was caused by an algorithm (vs. a human). We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results, including the potential weakening of collective action to address systemic discrimination. © 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to identify and analyze nurses' patterns of knowing and experiences with the preparation of families for disclosure to children living with HIV seropositivity. METHODS: thirteen pediatric nurses from Rio de Janeiro participated in the research using the sensitive creative method. Data were treated with Orlandi's discourse analysis and Carper's patterns of knowing. RESULTS: nurses' speeches revealed socioculturally constructed imaginary and ideological formations. The personal pattern of knowing, under the influence of negative media about the disease in the 1980s, generated stigma and prejudice. Empirical, esthetic, and ethical patterns were built on training and professional practice of the 1990s-2010s. They composed a context of (in)security about competence, to contribute to preparing families to disclose HIV to children. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: nurses' experience demonstrates knowledge to intervene and many challenges for their practical appropriation.

AB  - Opinion polls regularly show that the vast majority of French people have a positive perception of the efficacy and safety of using medicines, including vaccines. Distrust or hostility towards them is only the fact of a small minority of the population, but active and noisy on social networks and overvalued by the media and public authorities. However, the pandemic due to Covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2) has confirmed to what extent the perception of drug risk by the public is unstable, sometimes irrational, how many and complex the determinants of this perception are and what role as a public resonance, fears play out in the media. We can even implicitly see the general underlying tendency of our society, which is to grant primacy to risk to the detriment of profit in the assessment of a technological innovation. The risk tree often masking the forest of efficiency. This polarization of minds on risks, associated with an overestimation of low probabilities, testifies to the impregnation of our mores by the ideology of precaution. To which are added distorting factors such as naturalistic prejudice, cultural relativism and the planetary extension of social networks which instantly spread false information that is more viral and better remembered than the true ones, hampering communication based on science data. Promoting the correct perception of drug risk requires recalling both the benefits and the risks linked to action but also those linked to inaction; to clarify institutional messages by making them as factual as possible; to limit the number of public broadcasters to achieve greater consistency in their messages; to have the frankness to sometimes say that we do not know, medicine by nature being practiced in a context of uncertainty. The Academy calls for an ambitious educational policy for young people: training in critical thinking and the acquisition of the basics of drug risk should be introduced from middle school. The Academy also believes that the public is entitled to expect quality-controlled information from the media, away from rumors, by calling on indisputable experts and by favoring objective data over subjective testimonies based on personal experiences. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine
Des enquêtes d'opinion montrent régulièrement que, dans leur grande majorité, les Français ont une perception positive de l'efficacité et de la sécurité d'emploi des médicaments, y compris des vaccins. La défiance ou l'hostilité à leur égard ne sont le fait que d'une petite minorité de la population, mais active et bruyante sur les réseaux sociaux ainsi que dans les médias et surévaluée par les médias et les pouvoirs publics. Pourtant, la pandémie due au SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) a confirmé combien la perception du risque médicamenteux par le public est instable, parfois peu rationnelle, combien sont nombreux et complexes les déterminants de cette perception et quel rôle de caisse de résonance des peurs du public ont pu jouer les médias. On peut y voir en filigrane la tendance générale de notre société qui est d'accorder la primauté au risque, au détriment du bénéfice, dans l'appréciation d'une innovation technologique. L'arbre du risque cache souvent la forêt de l'efficacité. Cette polarisation des esprits sur les risques, associée à une surestimation des faibles probabilités, témoigne de l'imprégnation de nos mœurs par l'idéologie de la précaution. A quoi s'ajoutent des facteurs de distorsion tels que le préjugé naturaliste, le relativisme culturel et l'extension planétaire des réseaux sociaux qui répandent dans l'instantanéité de fausses informations plus virales et mieux mémorisées que les vraies, entravant la communication fondée sur les données de la science. Favoriser la juste perception du risque médicamenteux impose de rappeler à la fois les bénéfices, les risques liés à l'action, mais aussi ceux liés à l'inaction; de tenir le plus grand compte de l’évolutivité des connaissances; de clarifier les messages institutionnels en les rendant les plus factuels possibles; de limiter le nombre des émetteurs publics en vue d'aboutir à une plus grande cohérence de leurs messages; d'avoir la franchise de dire parfois qu'on ne sait pas, la médecine s'exerçant par nature en contexte d'incertitude. L'Académie en appelle à une politique pédagogique ambitieuse auprès des jeunes: une formation à l'esprit critique et une acquisition des bases de la culture du risque médicamenteux devraient être instaurées dès le collège. Elle estime en outre que le public est en droit d'attendre des médias une information de qualité, prudente, contrôlée et indépendante des rumeurs, en faisant appel à des experts indiscutables et en privilégiant les données objectives par rapport aux témoignages subjectifs fondés sur des expériences individuelles. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine

AB  - Mental health concerns have increased in prevalence since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many turn to online resources for relevant information. The purpose of this study is to describe the availability of mental health information on YouTube, and to assess the relevance of the videos’ content in relation to the actual need of the population. The 100 most-watched YouTube videos in English resulting from a YouTube search of “COVID-19” and “mental health” were evaluated. Of mental health conditions, anxiety and depression were mentioned in over 50% of the videos. A positive correlation was found between videos that mentioned anxiety and those that mentioned depression (p < 0.001). The numbers of videos focused on anxiety and depression were correlated with themes such as life stressors and social distancing (p < 0.05). Videos that did not make recommendations for dealing with stressors had more positive ratings than videos that did make such recommendations (p = 0.002). The content of YouTube videos addressing mental health issues during COVID-19 reflects the actual prevalence of specific mental health conditions during this same time period. Viewer ratings may be indicative of the public need for information about mental health conditions and validation for difficult experiences on social media sites. YouTube must be better utilized to disseminate information about mental illness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Media exposure for dark consumption products mostly shows glamorized and positive portrayals, rarely showing the negative consequences of consuming those products. However, the Netflix series Squid Game addresses the issue of gambling in its most extreme forms and shows the negative consequences related to it in a shocking manner, which begs the question whether watching the series could act as a preventive tool to increase risk perceptions, de-normalize gambling and reduce gambling behavior. A pre-registered survey study (N = 271) examined whether watching the Netflix series Squid Game affected young adults’ (18 to 35 years old) gambling intentions and play behavior through risk perceptions, subjective norms and attitudes toward gambling, and what role audience involvement plays. Although the results show that watching Squid Game increased young adults’ subjective norms of gambling (i.e. belief that significant others approve of the behavior in question) and further increased their positive attitudes toward gambling and gambling intention, the study also found an important impact of audience involvement. Audiences who were more involved with the series saw greater risks of gambling and perceived gambling to be less common. This resulted in more negative attitudes toward gambling and further less gambling intention and more motivation to change gambling behavior due to watching Squid Game. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The paper examines the representations of Ukrainian refugees in Polish press at the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion. Using corpus linguistics methods (namely, collocation analysis) it shows that the displaced Ukrainians were mostly referred to as (war) refugees and discussed with respect to their movement and reception in Poland. The study contrasts the construal of Ukrainian refugees in media outlets with different ideological and business aims. The findings are also discussed with respect to how European media tend to cover immigration from other regions, notably the Middle East and North Africa, and how these two types of migration become linked in the analysed news reports. Altogether, while pointing to a potential of the media to shape positive attitudes towards refugees, as attested by their coverage of Ukrainians, the study also highlights the extent to which racism is likely to determine the construal of different groups of migrants. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: The patient’s understanding of the illness may mediate beliefs towards its treatment. There is a paucity of studies examining the relationships between these variables in depression. This study was conducted to know the relationships between explanatory models and attitude to medication in depression. Materials and Methods: 494 patients with depression in remission were assessed with sociodemographic proforma, Drug Attitude Inventory, and Mental Distress Explanatory Model Questionnaire. Results: A favorable attitude toward medication was observed in 57.49% of participants. Mean scores on MDEMQ subscales Stress, Western Physiology, Non-Western Physiology, and Supernatural were 32.96, 21.87, 10.06, and 47.55, respectively. Statistically significant associations were found between attitude towards medication and the patient’s marital status (more negative attitude with single status, χ2 = 11.72, df = 3, P = 0.008) and occupation (more negative attitude among unemployed patients, χ2 = 4.17, df = 1, P = 0.041). The scores of explanatory models did not differ based on positive or negative drug attitude. Conclusion: Though explanatory models are not linked to patient attitudes toward medication, patients who are single or unemployed have a negative attitude toward medications. Such negative attitude may impair compliance and worsen patient outcomes. © 2022 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch.

AB  - Even though gender inequality is evident across life domains, women often justify the gender hierarchy. We examined whether the very closeness that heterosexual women share with their male romantic partners predicts their justification of gender inequality. We drew on intergroup-related research, showing that positive perceptions that minority groups develop within harmonious intergroup interactions, generalize to affect their views of group-based inequality. We expected that to the extent that women experience their romantic relationships positively, they will be more accepting of gender inequality within their homes, and these perceptions will generalize to predict justification of macro-level gender inequality. Five correlational and two experimental studies supported this prediction. The more women rated (or were primed with) their relationship as positive, the more they justified the gender social system. This was mediated by women’s perception of their housework division as fair, and was less pronounced among feminists. Implications regarding social change are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Word embeddings provide quantitative representations of word semantics and the associations between word meanings in text data, including in large repositories in media and social media archives. This article introduces social psychologists to word embedding research via a consideration of bias analysis, a topic of central concern in the discipline. We explain how word embeddings are constructed and how they can be used to measure bias along bipolar dimensions that are comparable to semantic differential scales. We review recent studies that show how familiar social biases can be detected in embeddings and how these change over time and in conjunction with real-world discriminatory practices. The evidence suggests that embeddings yield valid and reliable estimates of bias and that they can identify subtle biases that may not be communicated explicitly. We argue that word embedding research can extend scholarship on prejudice and stereotyping, providing measures of the bias environment of human thought and action. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Although there has been considerable research about attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, there has been little research into how people first come to be aware of minoritized sexual and gender minority (SGM) identities. This study sought to address this gap. A sample of sexual minority (n = 150) and heterosexual (n = 802) young adults (N = 952; Mage= 18.88 years, SD = 1.75; 949 were cisgender, three were transgender), primarily recruited from a large southern university, were asked retrospectively to recount their first exposure to or awareness of SGM identities. Responses between SGM and heterosexual participants were compared through a variety of analytical approaches, including analyzing themes about the source from which participants first recalled encountering these identities, and whether understanding about these identities came through a personal connection to someone with these identities. SGM participants reported encountering minoritized sexual identities a year earlier than did heterosexual participants, with both groups encountering these concepts in middle childhood, on average. SGM participants were more likely than heterosexual participants to report learning about minoritized gender identities from someone with a minoritized gender identity, while heterosexual participants more often reported learning about these identities from media or celebrities. Heterosexual (vs. SGM) participants were also more likely to imply that minoritized gender identities were adopted to be popular, rather than being authentic identities in themselves. Framed by developmental intergroup theory (DIT), we discuss implications of these findings, especially potential interrelationships with the development of prejudiced attitudes about SGM identities. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The tendency of world media to villainize of sharks has likely contributed to a disparity in the distribution of research and conservation resources among threatened marine megavertebrates, with elasmobranchs losing out. Increased public knowledge on elasmobranchs can shape public attitude and foster and gain support for elasmobranch conservation. Through an online survey, this study aimed to evaluate the drivers of public knowledge and examine linkages between awareness of elasmobranchs and attitude toward their conservation. To explore the relationships and effects between the different predicting variables and public elasmobranch knowledge and attitude indices, bi and multi-variate analysis and a partial least squares path model were used. The results indicated that the average public elasmobranch knowledge of the Cypriot population was moderate and the average public attitude towards elasmobranchs was relatively low. Marine-related activities and marine-related education were highly correlated with increased public elasmobranch knowledge and were the strongest predictors of the partial least squares path model which explained a high degree of variation in elasmobranch knowledge. Public elasmobranch knowledge was highly correlated with public attitude towards elasmobranchs. The findings of this study highlighted the importance of ocean literacy and education and provide insights into the mechanisms for developing and designing successful advocacy actions for elasmobranch conservation. © 2022.

AB  - Since November 1999, people arriving in Ireland to seek asylum have been dispersed throughout the country and confined in Direct Provision (DP) accommodation centres. Though initially meant for a six-month stay, by May 2020 7,700 people were living in 85 DP and emergency accommodation centres, many of them for up to nine years. The centres are operated by for-profit private companies who have been paid 1.6 billion euros since 2000, and are mostly sited in remote locations outside cities, on the periphery of society. The confinement of asylum seekers has been disavowed by state and society and continues the disavowal by Irish state and society of the coercive confinement of unwed mothers and poor children in church-run institutions, where women and children were confined and enslaved until late in the twentieth century. This article is based on interviews with and publicly available testimonies of asylum seekers in Direct Provision and on public and social media statements by the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI). It theorizes the DP centres as racialized zones of nonbeing (Fanon 1967: 8) and the DP regime as racialized state violence. The segregation and racialization of asylum seekers in Direct Provision were poignantly demonstrated by asylum seekers’ inability to observe social distancing in overcrowded DP centres during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a considerable number of them being infected. © 2022 Pluto Journals.

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, the Internet has gradually become an interactive platform for people to exchange ideas, collide emotions, spread information, and release emotions. The openness, anonymity, and inclusiveness of the Internet have reduced the obstacles of information dissemination and triggered the conflict of public opinion on the Internet. In addition, students actively express their opinions, attitudes, and feelings on important topics in life and study on the Internet, forming a certain scale of online opinions reflecting students' unique political attitudes, moral concepts, and values. Because college students are immature physically and mentally and the network environment is full of phenomena, it is easy to arouse their emotional resonance. Therefore, the free and diverse network environment presents new challenges and higher requirements of the times for the stable operation of college network public opinion guidance. Therefore, how to form systematic education in universities combined with ideological and political network public opinions under big data has become an important problem to be solved. Based on this paper presents the communication pattern of network public opinion and model it, namely, the random network public opinion transmission model. By comparing the scope and influence of the two transmission paths of network public opinion, the paper draws the conclusion and strengthens the teaching practice of ideological and political courses. Finally, it is pointed out that the research of the ideological and political network public opinion communication path is a complex digital communication system project, which requires the government, the media, and the schools together to give suggestions in the guidance of the network public opinion. © 2022 Shengyu Xu et al.

AB  - Reading is a significant and mass phenomenon, but the scientific research of various aspects of reading culture, such as the attitude of students towards required reading assignments, is scarce. Research on assigned reading in Croatia is mainly requested by media outlets for the purpose of publishing sensational titles. The results provided to media outlets by research agencies are of questionable scientific and methodological validity. The aim of this paper is to analyse how students and teachers perceive the attitude of students towards fulfilling the requirements pertaining to reading assignments with the purpose of devising efficient reading strategies. The research was conducted on the sample of 451 final year students in five high schools in Zagreb and 102 teachers of those final year students in the 2017-2018 school year. The results of the research indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between students and teachers in the perception of students’ attitude towards assigned reading, where teachers believe to a greater extent than students that students in their school have a positive attitude towards reading assignments. © 2022, FACTEACHEREDUCATION.

AB  - Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as business restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns, had social and economic impacts on individuals and communities. Caremongering Facebook groups spread across Canada to support vulnerable individuals by providing a forum for sharing information and offering assistance. We sought to understand the specific impacts of Caremongering groups on individuals 1 year after the pandemic began. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach that included semi-structured interviews with group moderators from 16 Caremongering groups and survey data from 165 group members. We used a constant comparative approach for thematic analysis of interview transcripts and open-ended text responses to the survey. We used source theme tables as joint displays to integrate interview and survey findings. Our results revealed five major themes: providing food, sharing information, supporting health and wellness, acquiring goods and services (non-food), and connecting communities. Respondents of our survey tended to be 35–65 years of age range, but reported helping adults of all ages. Our findings illustrate the potential of using a social media platform to connect with others and provide and access support. The Caremongering initiative demonstrates a community-driven, social media solution to issues such as isolation, loneliness and community health promotion. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article focuses on the 2013–2016 exhibitions in Moscow Manege which were later transformed into a network of entertainment centres (“historical parks”) Russia–my (hi)story. The exhibitions are built on multimedia technologies and include no authentic artefacts/museum objects. There is a growing network of such centres all over Russia, all organized in a similar manner, appealing to the visitor’s emotions and creating a relation of affect through the unravelling of a nationalistic historical narrative. Claimed to present “the objective picture of the Russian history” the exhibitions are following the recent developments in Russian cultural policies and history curricula. By analysing narratives presented at the “historical park” exhibitions, in policy documents and in media, this article follows the changes in public attitude towards history, which heritage is perceived as ‘difficult’ and ‘contested’ and how the digital representations influence these perceptions. Based on this analysis I argue that the reduction of the museum mechanism to only digital and multimedia form can bring along very serious issues in different political contexts. Russian historical parks enterprise, which combines the methods of fostering patriotism by the means of historical narrative templates both from the 19th and the 20th centuries, enhanced with the 21st-century technology in a form of “multimedia museums,” is only one of such examples © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License

AB  - Disgust specific to sexual stimuli has been thought to be an adaptation that serves purposes of pathogen-avoidance, partner selection and social dominance. While the link between disgust responses and homonegative and transnegative attitudes has been relatively established, it is not yet clear why. Literature using evolutionary psychology perspectives of these phenomena is scarce in areas with substantial LGBT-related violence like Colombia. This research aimed to study the interplay of predispositional (e.g. sociodemographic, reported contact), affective (e.g. disgust sensitivity) and cognitive (e.g. Right-Wing Authoritarian) variables in homonegative and transnegative attitudes of Colombian adults. Participants (N = 272) had a mean age of 26.38 (SD = 9.47), women comprised 72% of the sample and men 28%. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that increased sexual specific disgust sensitivity and greater RWA predicted stronger homonegativity and transnegativity. The relationship between sexual disgust and prejudice was partially mediated by RWA. Findings suggest that sexual disgust sensitivity adaptations in homonegativity and transnegativity may respond to selection pressures that differ from pathogen-avoidance perspectives, and that are associated with maintaining social hierarchy and social dominance. Anti-prejudice initiatives would benefit from targeting emotional responses of sexual disgust, especially within communities and institutions that have historically endorsed conservative and traditional values. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to identify strategies that counteract these negative representations. Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70% more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130% increase in acceptance of sharks and a 46% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors), and negative framing influenced negative changes (25% more negative attitudes toward sharks, a 18% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a 3% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for encouraging tolerance for sharks. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Combating harmful misinformation about pharmaceuticals on social media is a growing challenge. The complexity of health information, the role of expert intermediaries in disseminating information, and the information dynamics of social media create an environment where harmful misinformation spreads rapidly. However, little is known about the origin of this misinformation. This article explores the processes through which health misinformation from online marketplaces is legitimized and spread. Specifically, across one content analysis and two experimental studies, the authors investigate the role of highly legitimized influencer content in spreading vaccine misinformation. By analyzing a data set of social media posts and the websites where this content originates, the authors identify the legitimation processes that spread and normalize discussions about vaccine hesitancy (Study 1). Study 2 shows that expert cues increase the perceived legitimacy of misinformation, particularly for individuals who generally have positive attitudes toward vaccines. Study 3 demonstrates the role of expert legitimacy in driving consumers’ sharing behavior on social media. This research addresses a gap in the understanding of how pharmaceutical misinformation originates and becomes legitimized. Given the importance of the effective communication of vaccine information, the authors present key challenges for policy makers. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The watchdog role has been one of the most widely discussed normative functions of the press. In this study, we examine the public’s attitudes toward the news media’s watchdog performance and how they correlate with trust in news and news avoidance, two important phenomena for democracy and the health of the public sphere. We further examine how individual predispositions (e.g. political interest, ideology) and contextual variables (e.g. press freedom) moderate these relationships. Based on data from the 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, and controlling for a range of factors, we find that across 38 countries, watchdog performance evaluations are positively associated with trust in news but that they are also positively associated with higher levels of news avoidance. Last, we find that evaluations of media in other functions like helping citizens understand the most important topics of the day and choosing relevant topics were more strongly associated to trust in news and lower news avoidance levels than watchdog performance evaluations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Venous malformations are frequently localized in the head and neck region. However, a cervical localization with an endocranial extension is rather a very uncommon occurrence. We present a case of a 4-year-old child who presented with a large posterior cervical mass evolving for a year, firm and painful at palpation. Imaging was required, revealing a posterior cervical mass with an extension to adjacent structures, a destruction of the occipital bone and an endocranial extension. A macrobiopsy of the mass showed numerous irregular vessels. A surgical treatment was performed due to the extension of the mass, the esthetic prejudice it caused and the uncertain diagnosis. Venous malformation diagnosis was confirmed by a histological examination of the resected piece. Surgical management was not associated with the mass recurrence in our case. Here, we aim at identifying the clinical and radiological features of venous malformations, and at describing the different therapeutic features of this condition. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Increased exercise is a marker of health in fibromyalgia (FM). However, patients frequently avoid physical activity as a way of minimizing the pain they feel. This deprives them of opportunities to obtain positive reinforcement, increasing functional impact. Aims: This study examines the mediating role of depressive symptoms between walking (as physical exercise), functional impact, and pain, at different levels of positive affect (PA) among women with fibromyalgia. Design: Cross-sectional correlational study. Settings: Mutual aid associations for fibromyalgia in Spain. Participants: 231 women diagnosed with FM. Methods: Moderate mediation analyses were conducted using PROCESS. Results: First, a simple mediation model showed that depression mediated the effect of walking on functional impact, but not on pain. Additionally, the moderated mediated model showed that this effect was significant at medium and high levels of PA, but not when levels of PA were low. Conclusions: Provision of resources focused on positive affect seem to increase the positive effects of walking on functional impact through the reduction of depressive symptoms. Nurses can improve adherence of patients with FM to walking behavior through increasing positive affect. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - The social distancing policy as the basis for implementing learning from home makes it difficult for some teachers and students to adapt due to sudden changes. Online practicum learning at SMK is more challenging to implement. Students must possess the demands cognitive, affective, and psychomotor competencies. The main challenge for online learning in vocational education is how to expand traditional practice laboratories to the internet. This article synthesizes the study of virtual laboratories for online practicum learning. Articles published in the last five years are systemically reviewed. The existence of a laboratory that is fundamental to the experimentation of an object needs to be confirmed for its existence. Initially, virtual laboratories were developed to manipulate the presentation of difficult-to-handle materials in natural laboratories and abstract overview concepts. Opportunities to manage content that resembles actual conditions, visualization of complex materials, limited resources that can be overcome, personalization of learning, the minimal possibility of work accidents, the flexibility of time are the advantages of a virtual laboratory. Students are assumed to experience real-life education in the laboratory. Pre-practicum demonstrations in natural laboratories provide an opportunity to increase the achievement of learning objectives. Types of virtual laboratories that can be developed in online practicum learning are video-based laboratories, web-based laboratories, and remote-based laboratories. With the existence of a comprehensive study, the research results can be a reference for the development of virtual laboratory media for vocational learning. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

AB  - Nativism is one of the defining phenomena of the contemporary era. Yet, we know little about how malleable citizen attitudes associated with nativism and nationalism are to priming effects when media frames which deal with key issues such as immigration are introduced. In this article, we present the findings from a survey experiment fielded to a nationally representative sample of voters in Australia in May 2019. In it, we explore whether the attitudes of voters for different political parties can be primed by introducing two contrasting media frames to measure these effects. We find positive and negative frames have no effect on the attitudes of voters for Australia’s populist radical right party, but that the former has an effect on centre-right voters in Australia. Such findings have important implications for our understanding of political communication and the malleability of political attitudes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Relatively little is known about how gender and sexual orientation intersect to predict young adults’ responses to unwanted romantic and sexual overtures from men and women suitors. To better understand these potential differences, and explore possible mechanisms that explain them, this pre-registered study used an online questionnaire to assess reactions to both hypothetical and recalled suitors among a sample of 855 cisgender heterosexual and gay young adults (18–35) from the United States. Results revealed that gay women and heterosexual men reported the most negative hypothetical reactions to men (versus women) suitors, while gay women, heterosexual men, and heterosexual women all recalled more negative reactions to men than women suitors. Gay men recalled relatively benign reactions to suitors of both genders. A desire to be seen as one’s true orientation was a mediating factor for both gay women’s and heterosexual men’s negative reactions to men suitors. These findings and their potential explanations highlight the complexity of how gender and sexual orientation intersect to shape responses to romantic and sexual overtures from men and women suitors. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Celebrity disclosures and narratives are popular strategies in health promotion. However, less is known about their joint effects and the mechanisms through which they function. A 2 (narrative type: celebrity vs. layperson) x 2 (personal relevance: low vs. high) online experiment (N = 248) tested the impact of different narrative types in increasing awareness about prescription opioid abuse. Results indicated that a celebrity narrative is more persuasive than its layperson counterpart. Also, personal relevance toward opioid addiction moderated the influence of narrative type. Celebrity narratives evoked more positive attitudes toward opioid prevention and greater behavioral compliance intentions with the recommended action for low-relevance individuals. Transportation and identification mediated the effects of celebrity narratives on participants’ issue attitudes and behavioral intentions, but only for low-relevance individuals. Practically, the data suggest that incorporating celebrities in health narratives about opioid addiction prevention facilitates behavioral compliance, especially for individuals to whom a pressing health issue like opioid misuse is currently of low relevance. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: There is a paucity of data on the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms among pregnant and postnatal women with COVID-19 infection. We, therefore, aimed to explore the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19 at tertiary-level hospitals. Methods: This was a qualitative phenomenological study conducted in 2021 with a sample size of 16 women admitted at two referral hospitals serving as COVID-19 admission facilities for pregnant and postnatal women in Lusaka, Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted via telephone to understand what these women experienced when diagnosed with COVID-19. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted using the six steps approach to develop emerging themes. Results: Two major themes emerged: psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms. The primary psychosocial issues were worry and stigma. Women worried about infecting their unborn baby or neonate, being separated from the baby, the general safety of the baby, and the health of other family members. Women also worried about the attitude of health care providers and faced discrimination or stigma because of their infection. Thus, some coping mechanisms were developed that helped them, such as a positive attitude, keeping the disease secret, reliance on family members for support and using positive information from social media. Conclusion: This study provides unique insights into the psychosocial experiences of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19. Women were particularly concerned about the unborn baby’s well-being and discrimination. This study suggests the need for policy and clinical practice to consider the integration of effective mental health services into the provision of maternal health and COVID-19 services. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - A longitudinal field study tested the long-term effects (three years) of intergroup contact on both explicit and implicit outgroup attitudes. Participants were majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high-school students, who were tested at four waves from the beginning of their first year in high-school to the end of the third school year. Results revealed, first, a longitudinal association of quantity (but not quality) of contact with lower intergroup anxiety and more positive explicit attitudes, as well as bidirectional effects over time between explicit attitudes and intergroup anxiety, on the one hand, and quantity and quality of contact, on the other. Second, reduced intergroup anxiety mediated the association between quantity of contact and improved explicit attitudes over time. Third, the product of quantity and quality of contact longitudinally predicted more positive implicit outgroup attitudes over school years. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of findings. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The two major challenges facing people with mental health conditions (MHCs) are stigma and discrimination. This study focused on the Amitim program’s nationwide integrated arts-based groups that not only aim to impart knowledge and skills in the arts (e.g., theater, writing, music, poetry, visual art, etc.) but also reduce public and self-stigma, and promote personal recovery. This study, composed of a sample of 642 Israeli adults, examined whether people with MHCs and nonclinical community members who attended the integrated groups would report greater adaptive changes in outcomes than those who did not participate, the association of change process factors and in-group factors with these outcomes, and candidate mediators in the association between participation in the groups and the outcomes. The findings showed that change in creative self-efficacy (CSE) significantly predicted adaptive change in outcomes in people with MHCs who participated in these integrated arts-based groups. Participants with MHCs in groups facilitated by arts therapists reported significantly more positive outcomes than participants in groups with facilitators from other professional human services. Nonclinical community members in the integrated groups reported higher postprogram CSE and less desire for social distance from people with MHCs compared with the control group. Finally, change in the desire for social distance significantly mediated the relationship between group participation and change in public stigma. Overall, direct intergroup contact while engaging in arts-based activities appears to be a promising way to promote positive changes in people with MHCs and nonclinical community members. The implications and future directions are discussed. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - Are philosophical arguments as effective as narratives in influencing charitable giving and attitudes toward it? In four experiments, we exposed online research participants to either philosophical arguments in favor of charitable giving, a narrative about a child whose life was improved by charitable donations, both the narrative and the argument, or a control text (a passage from a middle school physics text or a description of charitable organizations). Participants then expressed their attitudes toward charitable giving and were either asked how much they would hypothetically donate if given $10 (Experiment 1) or told they had a 10% chance of winning $10 and given the opportunity to donate from their potential winnings (Experiments 2–4). Across the four experiments, participants in all of the narrative conditions and in some of the argument conditions tended to express more positive attitudes toward charitable giving and donated about $1 more on average than did participants in the control conditions. These effects appear to have been mediated by the “narrative transportation” scale, which suggests that appeals to donate can be effective if they engage participants’ emotions, imagery, and interest. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Jeremy Lin, an Asian American basketball player, achieved his meteoric stardom by giving outstanding performances and leading the Knicks to constant wins. Intense media coverage and scholarly work about Lin had been done during this starring time, while this research focuses on media representations of Lin during regular seasons. This article employs textual analysis and examines 461 articles from the first and last NBA seasons Lin played. The thematic analysis shows media representations of Lin became more diverse while rarely using racialized narratives. However, untrust and low expectations of Asian American masculinity are discovered in the analysis. In addition, stereotypical narratives such as “see someone Asian, say something Asian,” and the model minority myth beautify stereotypical impressions of Asian Americans and exacerbate their “otherness.” Such flattering compliments embedded in media coverage obfuscate Asian American identity, making it more difficult for them to prove their personality and masculinity. Although the media create and maintain hegemonic masculinity and stereotypes, they are also powerful to break down prejudice and discrimination and reshape people’s impressions of Asian American athletes, and even their whole community. © 2022 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of religiosity on luxury and counterfeit purchase intentions and to determine the role of consumer ethics in the context of counterfeit purchase intention. The conceptual framework is based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In the context of counterfeit consumption, religiosity is proposed to be an added component to the theory, while ethical consumption is proposed to mediate the relationship between religiosity and counterfeit purchase intention. In the context of luxury consumption, religiosity is proposed to precede TPB components which then affect luxury purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: This is a descriptive study; this study uses a mixed-methods approach, where eight semi-structured in-depth interviews and 500 surveys were conducted and distributed to Egyptian luxury consumers. Findings: The major results suggest that religiosity and ethical consumption negatively affect counterfeit purchase intention as proposed. The results also reveal that religiosity did not necessitate a negative attitude toward luxury consumption. Religiosity was found to have a positive effect on attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Only subjective norms had significant effect on luxury purchase intention in the research context. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the TPB by adding religiosity to the theory components as well as integrating the theory of planned behavior with Consumer’s Ethics theory in the context of counterfeit consumption. The study is an attempt to compare between luxury and counterfeit purchase intention while considering the role of individual’s religiosity in these purchases. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Bangladesh has experienced the hardest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact on the socioeconomic sector. The underprivileged group, rickshaw pullers, faced extreme situations due to the pandemic. This rapid cross-sectional study was conducted among 190 rickshaw pullers of Dhaka city. Knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey was carried out to evaluate their view and COVID-19 response level. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Statistical analyses such as Kruskal–Wallis or Mann–Whitney U tests, Spearman’s rank correlation, the linear regression model, Chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test were performed where appropriate. The majority of them rated the high impact of COVID-19 on their income and mental health. Age, living with family, accommodation type, income, and COVID-19 infection history were found as associating factors with these impacts. A large number of the study population demonstrated low knowledge level (42.63 percent), moderate attitude level (57.37 percent), and moderate practice level (58.95 percent) toward COVID-19 and the vaccination. Positive attitude could reduce their mental health concern due to the pandemic. The study population mostly used their surrounding people as the main source of COVID-19 information. However, digital media have played a crucial role to disseminate authentic information. Ensuring better socioeconomic conditions can help these highly vulnerable people to be effectively prepared and respond against the pandemic. © 2022 Weston Medical Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the era of COVID-19, travel decisions are influenced by social norms, which is a deciding factor between one's perception of risk and their travel intention. Moreover, serious safety measures, such as increased aircraft cleaning, social distancing during the boarding process, and the use of face masks are critical factors that influence passengers' trust in air travel. This study examines the direct effects of safety and preventive measures and social norms on passengers' trust in travelling with airlines. A total of 210 responses were obtained online. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the study hypotheses. Based on the result, social norms are the most influential predictors of passengers' trust, followed by safety and preventive measures. Furthermore, the study suggests that media coverage and social circle influence can be critical elements in transferring information to passengers, influencing their decision, and instill trust to travel during the pandemic. Notably, apart from exercising social norms, the airline industry also needs to focus on safety and preventive measures consisting of staff safety practices towards the passenger and new standard operating procedures (SOPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings assist the airline industry in understanding passengers' post-pandemic travelling behaviour. Notably, the implementation of health security protocols at airports, supported by the provision of continuous safety information, is indeed an important feature for passengers. © 2022 Center for International Scientific Research of VSO and VSPP.

AB  - Pride events challenge hegemonic notions of sexuality and gender within places they are held. This is particularly the case in rural communities that are perceived, rightly or wrongly, as prejudices towards individuals with a diverse sexuality or gender identity. However, although academic literature has extensively explored Pride events within an urban context, limited attention has been paid to the rural context, and still little to those in their infancy. This article examines how stakeholders responded to the cancellation of a Pride event in the Australian rural township of Wagga Wagga due to COVID19. The pandemic, in this context, provided an opportunity to understand attitudes towards the event and its cancellation. Through this process, eight topics were identified as: council funding, cancellation as homophobic, last-minute cancellation, cancellation regretted, cancellation supported, organizers acknowledged, LGBTIQI+, and Pride event. Based on these findings, implications for the cancellation of social contentious events in response to such circumstances are identified. These implications suggest the need for a more considered approach to communicating about the cancellation to prevent allegations of prejudice and demonstrate the value of such events © 2022.

AB  - The long months of social distance to which the pandemic has forced us have certainly accelerated the idea that the re-mediation of the concept of distance in a digital horizon can open up new spaces of negotiation for many social and cultural practices in the future. But it has also, dramatically, highlighted the limits and risks contained in the very idea that the experience of the meta-universe can really do without the mediation of physical reality and human direct intervention. The reflections and design experience proposed here therefore aim to reflect on the role that the new technologies and traditional professionals are playing in relation with the phygital cultural experience. The idea of the contemporary museum is indagated, questioning, however, the quality of the 'relationship' between the work of art and the user and the ways in which design can respond creatively to the demand for cultural consumption by activating new processes of attribution of meaning. © 2022.

AB  - The paper analyses popular geographical imageries of the European migrant crisis. It focuses on visualities that shaped discussions about the event among Czech Facebook users with anti-immigration attitudes. The paper elaborates on the co-production of migrants’ visibility and visualities that depict them in certain ways. Visuality influences visibility and shapes what it means for people (who are represented by images) to be visible in certain ways when seen by another people (who observe and consume the images). Here, we analyse how cartographic visualizations and the practice of montage of images produce meanings and affects that make migrants either visible only as abusers of the Czech social welfare system (linking migrants in a racist way to the Roma minority) or visible only as dehumanized raging Muslim invaders that resemble more machine-like beings. These interpretations are explained with references to historical specificities of the Czech context. A user-made, film-like sci-fi video of the crisis is also analysed carefully to demonstrate its imaginary of a collapsing Western Europe, where raging invaders dominate. Presenting migrants’ visuality as invaders links these racist and Islamophobic attitudes to migrants’ visibility as enemies and targets to be killed, not pitiable human beings to be helped. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Do discussions in echo chambers break down barriers on the acceptance political violence? We know from research within political science, social psychology and communication that deliberation in echo chambers—called enclave deliberation—works as a driver for the amplification of existing political attitudes. Moreover, scholars of radicalization have argued that enclave deliberation can lead to extremist ideas and the acceptance of political violence in response to political grievances. Yet, amplification of attitudes, even into extremist ideas, is not the same as accepting violence. We still lack causal backing for the widespread claim that enclave deliberation fuels acceptance of political violence. Utilizing a novel laboratory experiment with 188 participants, this article delivers causal evidence suggesting that enclave deliberation increases politically aggrieved group members’ acceptance of violence. In addition, I find causal evidence supporting the claim that enclave deliberation amplifies existing political attitudes and makes group members’ opinions less diverse. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper affords an insight into an important phenomenon related to the current worldwide increase in xenophobic behavior. In the past as well as in the present, the issue of anti-Semitism was the topic to be discussed; we note the dangers of the return and growth of populist and racist political parties and social movements while observing similar discussions today, especially in Eastern Europe (including Slovakia). They are linked to the current anti-vaccination and anti-war movements. This study had three objectives: (1) To present the critical antiSemitic narratives that survived communism and were re-mediated after the establishment of an independent Slovakia in 1993; (2) to identify inherited mechanisms that continue to determine the forms of negative attitudes of Slovaks towards Jews; (3) to identify and analyze current narratives representing new forms of digital anti-Semitism in the current disinformation media in Slovakia. This paper employs a structured interview method with thirteen Slovak multi-disciplinary experts to research crucial inherited and current anti-Semitic narratives. Our research identified ten anti-Semitic narratives that remain in the current disinformation media. The research also points to two former mechanisms from the communist era that still influence the attitudes of Slovaks towards Jews. This also influences the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism: the generational influence, under which intolerant attitudes pass from generation to generation, and the influence of (inherited) power and economic “remorse”, accompanied by the common notion of the “exploitation” of countries (including Slovakia) by the Jewish community. Finally, four new and current narratives have been identified through structured interviews with experts, determining the nature of current digital anti-Semitism. © 2022 Hedviga Tkáčová

AB  - The secondary transfer effect proposes that contact with an outgroup impacts attitudes towards another, secondary outgroup. For positive contact, three pathways have been identified for the effect: attitude generalization, multiculturalism, and ingroup reappraisal (deprovincialization hypothesis, operationalized here as national pride). Research on negative secondary transfer effects is still scarce. Using data from a German nationally representative survey, we investigated negative secondary transfer effects from foreigners to refugees. The three pathways were compared while considering positive and refugee contact. Negative and positive secondary transfer effects both occurred (partially) mediated via attitude generalization and multiculturalism but not via national pride. We conclude there might be a risk of generalizing prejudice from unrelated negative experiences via these two mechanisms. Research on forced migration and intergroup contact should further explore them with the ultimate goal of preventing negative secondary transfer effects. Longitudinal or experimental research is needed to address causality, ideally involving various outgroups. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Identity fusion with the community has been previously found to mediate altruism in post-disaster settings. However, whether this altruistic response is specifically triggered by ingroup threat, or whether it can also be triggered by global threats remains unclear. We evaluated willingness to sacrifice in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic across three survey waves. Against expectations, participants fused with the nation (vs. non-fused) did not differentially respond to a national versus global threat condition. Conversely, social norms decisively influenced willingness to sacrifice in this sample, with fused individuals with stronger norms about social distancing reporting the highest altruistic response during the first weeks of the pandemic. Longitudinally, after an initial peak in the altruistic response, deteriorating social norms mediated decreases in willingness to sacrifice in individuals fused with the nation (vs. non-fused). Implications of these results for the development of interventions aimed to address global challenges are discussed. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the perspective of persons with disabilities (PWDs) and of key stakeholders concerning the contents and genre of media that should be used to promote a positive attitude of society towards PWDs. The participants were Facebook and LINE users who were purposively selected by snowball sampling through the announcement on the Facebook page. Eight key informants participated in this study, including two PWDs, a private media producer, two general social media users and three researchers (one with disability and two without disability). Four focus groups and information sharing among participants via LINE group were conducted. Transcriptions from the participants were analyzed. The findings illustrate that a negative image of PWDs still persists in various plots in current and existing media. New media presenting the image of PWDs as multi-dimensional human beings should be promoted and created. Socialization and cultivation of inclusive living since childhood between PWDs and able bodied persons in the society are important to promote understanding, leading to positive attitudes. A short film is a current suitable media type to promote a positive attitude of society towards PWDs. Facebook and LINE platforms should be considered for data collection, particularly with PWDs who have limited mobility and difficulty to be transported. © 2022.

AB  - In light of the prolonged period of social distancing and highly mediated communication patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study sought to understand how pandemic-related fear affects social connectedness. Drawing from the Internet-enhanced self-disclosure and fear-eliciting affiliation hypotheses, survey findings from a stratified sample collected among Hong Kong university students (N = 310) revealed that pandemic-related fear positively influences social connectedness not only through self-disclosure but also through the combination of information seeking and self-disclosure. Social interaction, however, does not mediate the relationship between fear and social connectedness on its own. Overall, we argue that fear motivated people to seek information, self-disclose, and articulate connectedness with society. During this process, social media provided an essential ground and self-disclosure proved a viable tool. This study demonstrated that negative emotions aroused in crisis situations might result in constructive behaviors, which is contingent on how people react to mitigate the negative consequences.

AB  - Self-esteem (a positive attitude toward oneself) and self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to perform actions that lead to desired outcomes) are predictors of affective well-being. However, there is a lack of longitudinal research on their relative importance in predicting positive and negative affect. This study sought to examine the relative strength of these 2 variables in predicting affective well-being. Data from the German Aging Survey (DEAS), collected in 4 waves between 2008 and 2017, were used. The random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used for data analysis. Within-person results showed that self-esteem and self-efficacy did not predict future levels of negative affect. Self-esteem, but not self-efficacy, was found to be a predictor of future levels of positive affect. In addition, positive affect predicted future self-efficacy. A longitudinal mediation model showed that self-esteem predicted future self-efficacy via positive affect. Thus, self-esteem contributes directly to future levels of positive affect and indirectly to future levels of self-efficacy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rape victims are frequently blamed for their own victimization, which adds to their psychological distress. However, Chinese scholars have generally not paid attention to the public’s attitudes toward, and attributions for, rape. In this study, we explored the effects of gender, rape myth acceptance, and situational factors (victim-perpetrator relationship, victim resistance, victim reporting) on rape attributions among Chinese observers. A sample of 1,011 participants from the Chinese community completed a series of questionnaires after reading one of 12 vignettes. Our results indicated that the relationship between gender and victim blame was moderated by reporting and suppressed by rape myth acceptance, while the relationship between gender and perpetrator blame was mediated by rape myth acceptance. In addition, both higher rape myth acceptance and non-stranger rape can increase victim blame and decrease perpetrator blame. We also found interactions between rape myth acceptance and resistance and between reporting and the victim-perpetrator relationship. These results suggest that it is critical to investigate the complex interplay between individual and situational factors that influence rape attributions. Rape attributions showed both cross-cultural consistency and patterns unique to the Chinese context, and our evidence provides ideas for reducing the negative social reaction of the public to rape victims. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Dementia awareness initiatives aim to promote helping behaviors toward people living with dementia. We applied the bystander intervention process model in the context of the general public's helping behaviors toward people living with dementia, and we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying the association between dementia knowledge and helping behaviors. Research Design and Methods: In a survey featuring vignettes for the general public in Japan (N = 904), we presented four situations in which people could exhibit helping behaviors toward a person with dementia. Guttman scale analysis was used to test this sequential ordering of the bystander intervention process model: (a) interpreting the need to help, (b) perceiving personal responsibility, and (c) intention to provide help. Mediation analysis was used to examine whether the effects of knowledge on helping behaviors were mediated by attitude toward people living with dementia and the bystander intervention process. Results: The results support the two-step model in which interpreting the situation as one where assistance is required is a prerequisite of helping behavior. Dementia knowledge had a significant total effect on intention to provide help (β = 0.136, p <. 001). Interpretation (indirect effect: β = 0.092, p <. 001), as well as attitude (indirect effect: β = 0.044, p <. 001), was found to completely mediate the effect of dementia knowledge on intention to provide help. Discussion and Implications: Dementia awareness initiatives designed to promote helping behaviors should focus on knowledge transfer, improving the general public's attitudes toward people living with dementia, and their ability to interpret when such people need assistance. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Given the growing importance of social media (SM) for tourism promotions, the present study examined a destination image model that includes SM as image formation agents (IFAs) (autonomous, induced, and organic), cognitive image (attractions and support), affective image, and social distance as a moderator, grounded in construal level theory. With the sample of tourists (N = 699), structural equation modeling revealed that each IFA group had different patterns of effects in shaping cognitive image, which in turn influenced affective image. Latent moderated structural equation modeling analysis showed that social distance had a negative interacting effect with each of the IFA groups in forming the attractions image, highlighting the significant moderating role of social distance in the process. This study enriches an understanding on the crucial roles of IFAs and social distance in the image formation process within the SM context. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With the global evolution of COVID-19, and Malaysia’s efforts in containing it, the onus of curtailing spread depends on the efforts of Malaysians to comply and adapt to the emerging new social norms. Our aim was to study the attitudes and practices of residents in Penang and Kedah towards COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted in late October 2020 via an online self-reported structured questionnaire. A five-point Likert scale was used in both 12-item attitudes and 10-item practices questionnaires. Data scored was converted into categorical data based on median value of good and bad attitudes and practices. Spearman’s correlation was used to analyse the relationship between attitudes and practices, while Chi-square test was used to determine the differences of attitudes and practices between the two states. RESULTS: A total of 834 respondents were enrolled, who were mostly aged 20 to 30, of Malay and Chinese ethnicity, and were from the green zone (40.9%). The mean attitudes score was 44.5 for Kedah and 44.3 for Penang. The mean practices score was the same for both states at 10.8. Gender was significantly associated with good attitudes (p=0.007) in Penang. Gender: Penang (p=0.007) and Kedah (p=-0.001), marital status (p=0.003) and employment status (p=0.001) in Kedah were significantly associated with good practices. Overall, 94.8% agreed to strict enforcement of social distancing and masking. A weak but positive correlation (r=0.30; p<0.001) was found between attitudes and practices. Shortfall in practices relating to not wearing mask properly, not disposing of masks properly and poor cough etiquette. CONCLUSION: Level of compliance to the new norms was generally good with little difference between the two states. A small proportion of people still had poor practices. We need to ensure that the social norms are sustained by the community. © 2022. IIUM Medical Journal Malaysia. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This article offers an analysis of scholarly attempts to make sense of the nexus of race and migration in Brexit-era UK discourse. To illustrate my arguments that intend to challenge and extend existing scholarship, I discuss exemplary snapshots from news articles, blog posts and social media sources. Building on critical race and postcolonial studies as theoretical background, I trace the phenomenon of naming the discrimination against East Europeans – which is undeniably one of the driving forces of the Brexit discussion – ‘racism’. Sometimes, and this shows the pattern of the overgeneralization of the term, ‘racism’ gets extended to name the post-Brexit exclusion of any EU nationals. This use of ‘racism’, however, is based on methodological nationalism and conceptual whiteness as my analyses show. To make sense of the overlapping racist, anti-immigration and anti-EU rhetoric that marks the pre- and post-Brexit moment in the United Kingdom, this article introduces the concept of ‘migratism’ – a name for the power relation that ascribes migration to certain people, constructing them as migrants and discriminating against them. The terms ‘migratism’ and ‘migratization’ function grammatically in an analogue way to ‘racism’ and ‘racialization’. If racism is the power relation that racializes (=ascribes race to) people, migratism if the power relation that migratizes (=ascribes migration to) people. The terms are not symmetrical but have a complicated interdependent relationship. Racism and migratism are bound to each other and play a crucial role in organizing the Western nation state. The suggested concepts foreground a postcolonial understanding of race and racism and make it possible to analyse both migration-based discrimination and discrimination based on perceived migration in violence and hate crimes connected to the Brexit referendum. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the Indian context, women, especially Dalit women, have been subjected to scripturally and culturally sanctioned misogyny. These deep-rooted prejudices are manifested at both the societal and the institutional levels. In such a scenario, any assertion of justice by Dalit women is fraught with tensions. The sexual violence against them is routinized, normalized and invisibilized. For the victims, it is a lonely struggle as civil society scarcely registers such crimes; for the law and judiciary, it is another claim for meagre compensation. Their bodies are bereft of honour, and their sexuality is viewed with suspicion, easily accessible to any male of the dominant communities who can lay claim to it. This article explores two case studies—Khairlanji and Nirbhaya, geographically distinct spaces, where Dalit women were brutally raped and mutilated, and the perpetrators were let off lightly. The mainstream media largely ignored the developments. The article also focuses on the fissures within the feminist movement vis-à-vis caste and the politics of sexuality. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Presence of gay men in mainstream media may have a positive impact on viewers’ attitude change. However, gay male characters are often stereotypically portrayed as feminine, and no research has yet explored audiences’ reactions to counter-stereotypical gay characters. Heterosexual Italian men (N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants’ prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character. Findings are in line with the social identity theory prediction that when gay men (outgroup) are perceived as too similar, and potentially threaten the group identity, heterosexual men would attempt to restore ingroup distinctiveness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients in individual psychotherapy needed to suddenly transition to telepsychotherapy (TPT), and for many patients it was their first experience of remote treatment. Since TPT appears to be here to stay after the pandemic ends, it is crucial to understand which factors determine whether TPT is a good fit for patients. We aimed to examine patients’ relational predictors, both trait- (attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety) and state-like (working alliance, real relationship) of patients’ attitudes towards TPT, and the potential mediating role of state-like relational variables between trait-like variables and attitudes. We used a longitudinal design, where patients (N = 719) who were in individual TPT participated in an online survey at the beginning of the pandemic and at follow-up three months later. Patients completed measures of symptom severity, Covid-related distress, attachment anxiety and avoidance, perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and attitude towards TPT. Results suggested that higher levels of attachment avoidance predicted more negative attitudes towards TPT, and that patient-reported quality of the real relationship in their TPT sessions mediated this negative relationship between attachment avoidance and attitudes towards TPT. Patient’s attachment avoidance and the real relationship are important predictors of patients’ attitudes towards TPT, and could indicate suitability of the TPT format, as well as inform clinicians’ efforts in building a real and genuine connection with their patients online. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Democratic school climate, critical reflection, and student participation at school have been linked to the development of civic and political attitudes. The study aims to identify the contribution of these characteristics to the development of civic and political attitudes and their impact on students’ participation (civic, political, activist, and lifestyle/online). Questionnaire data were collected in two waves with 1589 students from four European countries (Italy, Sweden, Germany, and the Czech Republic). Structural equation modelling tested the effects of school characteristics on different types of participation, mediated by institutional trust, political efficacy, and political interest. The results highlight the importance of opportunities for active involvement and critical reflection in fostering interest, efficacy, and all forms of participation activities. Democratic school climate was found to positively impact institutional trust and efficacy, but not participation. The findings highlight the need for a school environment that invites critical reflection and gives value to students’ participation. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Abortion is seen as a violation of a woman’s presumed role of being a mother. As the female population grows diverse, women are acting in multiple social roles outside traditional motherhood. Whether this development will challenge social perceptions of women and further affect public attitudes toward abortion remains less known. Based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), this study found both stereotypical and attributional factors influenced attitudes toward abortion. Female and male perceivers differed in terms of compassion as an emotional mediator of attitudes. The study provides empirical evidence and theoretical implications that explains the stereotypical processing toward women with abortion. © 2022 Atlantic Journal of Communication.

AB  - Previous research has neglected media audiences’ and citizens’ opinions on how the media should be organized, how they should function in society and what individual, corporate and state responsibilities should be in regard to these questions. In an attempt to understand the relationship between citizens’ broader political attitudes and their attitudes on media-related politics and responsibilities, this study uses a survey (n = 2003) of the adult Swedish population to investigate the distribution of a range of media political attitudes in the contemporary space of political positions. The results reveal overlaps between the space of media political attitudes and the broader political space, where support for a Nordic ‘media welfare state’ corresponds to leftist and GAL-oriented values, while TAN-oriented and right-wing attitudes link to scepticism towards state interventionism in the media landscape. A small but highly opinionated right-wing and TAN-oriented segment displays laissez-faire views on media policy that are reflected in current policy propositions from right-wing political parties in parliament. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes towards pediatric dental radiography and its associated factors among Turkish parents seeking dental care for their children. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 483 parents of children aged 6–15 years. Data were collected using the questionnaire including socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes based on The Health Belief Model and planned behavior theory. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were performed. Results: More than half of parents had correct knowledge on their rights to access health information, the radiation risk and exposure from dental X-rays, children’s vulnerability to radiation, and using lead apron. Most parents (70.4%) perceived dental X-rays as valuable. They had limited knowledge regarding the permanent damage and negative attitudes regarding its safety and goodness. There were positive correlations between knowledge-attitudes, knowledge-perceived benefits, and attitudes-perceived benefits (all p values < 0.01). Having a previous dental X-ray (p = 0.014) and not having parents’ information needs (p = 0.007) were associated with higher attitudes. Increasing education levels, having a educational need and higher perceived benefit were found to be predictors of higher parental knowledge. Conclusion: Turkish parents had some knowledge and positive attitudes towards pediatric dental X-rays but not at optimum levels. Parents’ education levels, information needs, and beliefs were the most important factors affecting parental knowledge. Attitudes towards radiation safety and goodness should be improved. Clinical relevance: These findings may provide useful insight to clinicians when developing theory-driven health education interventions on pediatric dental X-rays and identifiying the parents with low knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Digital contact tracing (DCT) has become an efficient method for authorities to curb COVID-19. However, the current public opinion studies on the adoption of DCT primarily focus on Western countries and rarely explore citizen attitudes in Asian contexts where DCT is often mandatory. Moreover, the existing literature extensively explores how privacy concern negates the adoption of DCT without illuminating the solutions to such barriers. To unveil the mechanisms of DCT adoption, this study explores how Singaporeans’ privacy concern, political trust, and technology literacy can influence their attitudes toward TraceTogether (a local DCT program). An analysis of survey data suggests that privacy concern is positively associated with negative attitudes toward DCT. Those with high levels of political distrust also hold negative attitudes toward DCT. Political distrust is also found to positively mediate the relationship between privacy concerns and negative attitudes toward DCT. Finally, moderated mediation findings suggest that the indirect effects of privacy concern on negative attitudes toward DCT via political distrust increase with an increase in technological literacy. Simply put, the indirect effects are stronger for those with higher-tech literacy. We discuss the tension between privacy concerns and public health during the pandemic and propose policy suggestions. © 2022 Central States Communication Association.

AB  - Introduction: This survey of wound care specialists in the UK aims to be the first study to establish the prevalence of mobile wound app use and the perceived barriers to their implementation in wound care. This article presents the quantitative findings of the study. Method: A cross-sectional survey of UK-based wound clinicians was undertaken to explore the current use of mobile applications in the field of wound care. A 40 question SurveyMonkey survey was used and distributed via closed Facebook groups for clinicians working in UK-based wound care services. Data analysis included calculation of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for attitude scales, summary statistics and thematic analysis of free text responses. Not reported in this paper The STROBE checklist was considered within the methodology of the study. Results: Overall, n=250 survey responses were received. Complete survey responses were received from n=153 wound clinicians. This included responses from 121 nurses and 29 podiatrists and from clinicians from all four devolved nations of the UK. Only 21–24% of clinicians reported using mobile applications for wound care at the time of this survey. Almost all (99.5%) of clinicians responding to the survey have access to a smartphone with most (58.7%) having both a personal and work smartphone Conclusions: It is evident that UK-based clinicians currently use mobile smartphones regularly, including within their clinical work, but do not currently use wound care focussed mobile applications. Barriers affecting the implementation of mobile applications in wound care services include a lack of interoperability between mobile applications and other IT infrastructure, poor Wi-Fi signal, negative attitudes towards technology, a lack of workforce diversity and bureaucratic obstructions. Implications for practice: Clinical leaders in wound care should consider the factors identified within this study when developing implementation strategies for new mobile application technologies into wound care services. © 2022, OmniaMed Communications Ltd.

AB  - Dadvertising—advertisements that portray dads as active caretakers—is predicted to be particularly relevant to men who are new or first-time fathers. This research tests a conceptual model for understanding the effects of anxiety, wishful identification, and emotional response on new and expectant dads’ empowerment, attitude toward the dadvertisement, and attitude toward the brand. Six hypotheses were tested through a between-groups experimental design utilizing two ad stimuli—one that showed a progressive/nurturing dad and one that showed a hypermasculine/traditional dad. Findings indicate that dadvertisements depicting nurturing fathers were evaluated more positively on emotional responses, wishful identification, and progressive ad perceptions than hypermasculine/traditional portrayals. Increased anxiety was related to less positive emotions toward, and weakness perceptions of, the modern fatherhood ad stimulus, as well as less positive perceptions of, and wishful identification with, the advertisement. Finally, mediation effects were found among positive emotional responses, positive dad perceptions, and wishful identification on dadvertising outcome variables, including more positive attitudes toward the ad, brand, and empowerment. This research contributes to the understanding of consumer responses toward dadvertisements and the differing responses toward the portrayals of fatherhood in ads. © 2022 Advertising Association.

AB  - The current study assessed how the extent to which a gay man resembled a prototypical gay man influenced the judgements others made about them. We hypothesized that highly prototypical gay men would be perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes of gay men, engage in more activities within the gay community, viewed less positively by others, and receive more discrimination. Additionally, perceived group identification and negative stereotypes attributed to the gay man were expected to serially mediate the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, positive attitudes, and discrimination from others. Participants (N = 364) were randomly assigned to view stimuli depicting either a low or high prototypical gay man. High prototypical gay men were perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes, and engage in more stereotypical immoral activities, than low prototypical gay men. Moreover, perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution serially mediated the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, attitudes toward target, and discrimination. Implications for the Prejudice Distribution Account are discussed. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - Children being vulnerable, have special protection under the law through their parents or guardian who are responsible for them; and make decisions for them because they lack legal capacity. One of these decisions a parent/guardian makes is determining the religion of a child. Once the parent/guardian chooses the religion of the child, the child may become bound by its practices throughout childhood. While the right of parents to determine the religion of their children is recognised by domestic, regional and international laws, the way courts in Nigeria treat this recognition suggests that the right is not absolute. This paper adopts the doctrinal methodology in interrogating the extent to which Nigerian Courts permit the observation by a child of the religious practices of his/her parent in relation to submission to medical treatment in order to protect the child's right to life. This paper argues that law and morality are media of social control but have their convergence and divergence. It further argues that sanctity of human life which for many forbids suicide, requires that even adults should not be allowed to object to medical treatment which refusal may result in death which can be seen as "disguised suicide." These authors examined the Supreme Court decision in Medical Dental Practitioners Disciplinary Council v. Okonkwo and found that; Nigerian Courts recognise parent right to choose their children religion and practices however, any religious practice prejudicial to the child based on the "best interest" principle provided under the Child Right Act and its States equivalent will be jettisoned. It examines the practice in Britain and Canada and draw lessons for Nigeria. This paper recommends public enlightenment, prohibition of harmful religious beliefs such as objection to life-saving medical procedure by parents for minors as means of balancing parents/guardian right to choose their children religious beliefs and preservation of the children right to life. © 2022 Universidad de Jaen.

AB  - Attitudes toward same-gender parenting are of timely relevance, given increasing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights around the world. Two studies examined the influence of 2 predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The first was informational influence, which was manipulated via a newspaper-style article dispelling misconceptions about gender identity of children reared by same-gender parents. The second was social influence via parasocial contact measured as prior exposure to a same-gender adoptive parents TV show. Religious fundamentalism (RF) was assessed as an individual difference moderator of informational or social influence. Outcome variables were beliefs about same-gender parenting, perceived problems with same-gender parenting, and social distance from same-gender adoptive parents. We studied these relationships in Canada (Study 1, where same-gender couples’ adoption is legal) and in Italy (Study 2, where same-gender couples’ adoption is not legal). RF moderated the results of informational and social influence in the Canadian context, such that those high in RF tended to be favorably influenced. In Italy, results of informational influence were typically observed among those low in RF, and social influence directly predicted favorable attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Informational and social influence can improve attitudes toward same-gender parenting, but RF and legal/cultural context are also important to consider. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This paper addresses what variables predict and mediate relationships involving accessing telemedicine in the form of online birth control websites that are often advertised online on social media. Basic Procedures: This is a survey study of N = 252 under 60 women (Mage = 24.71); multiple linear regression and mediation analyses were done to examine the influence of IBM variables on behavioral intentions. Main findings: Women who currently use contraceptives report comfort and likelihood to use telemedicine services if they have positive attitudes about telemedicine and DTC advertising. Comfort with using an online contraceptive prescription service mediated the relationship between contraceptive use and likelihood to use telemedical services and between positive telemedicine attitudes and likelihood. Principal conclusions: Women who are positive about telemedicine and DTC ads are comfortable using these resources, and comfort is a salient mediator. Comfort and its antecedents are important predictors and facilitators of telemedicine intentions and behaviors. Using telemedicine can improve the patient experience by offering alternatives to face-to-face visits (i.e., removing barriers to provider-to-patient communication). © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all societal domains, including sports. Social distancing measures and the closure of sports facilities posed especially severe challenges for grassroots sports clubs, which thrive on joint activities and member social contact. Drawing on mediatization theory, the study examines the communication challenges faced by grassroots sports clubs and the perceived potential of digital media to overcome these obstacles during and beyond the pandemic. Based on in-depth interviews with 32 club officials of German grassroots sports clubs, the study identified ongoing uncertainty about COVID-19 regulations, preserving members’ sense of belonging during social distancing, and involving everyone in formal processes as the major communication challenges. While most of the interviewees valued the potential of digital media to address these challenges, they acknowledged that the benefits of digital media for individual members would depend on their skill, motivation, and concerns, as well as on the availability of digital infrastructure. For that reason, digital media were not considered a substitute for face-to-face social contact or sporting activity but were seen to extend opportunities for communication and training. More generally, these findings raise new questions about the relationship between mediatization and social cohesion. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the manifestation of the damage caused by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), the extreme FASD manifestation, show both facial dysmorphology and mental retardation. Alcohol consumed during gestational age prejudices brain development by reducing, among others, the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors and neuroinflammatory markers. Alcohol drinking also induces oxidative stress. Hypothesis/Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the potential association between neurotrophins, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress in 12 prepubertal male and female FASD children diagnosed as FAS or partial FAS (pFAS). Methods: Accordingly, we analyzed, in the serum, the level of BDNF and NGF and the oxidative stress, as free oxygen radicals test (FORT) and free oxygen radicals defense (FORD). Moreover, serum levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, MCP-1, TGF-β, and TN-F-α) involved in neuroinflammatory and oxidative processes have been investigated. Results: We demonstrated low serum levels of NGF and BDNF in pre-pubertal FASD children with respect to healthy controls. These changes were associated with higher serum presence of TN-F-α and IL-1α. Quite interestingly, an elevation in the FORD was also found despite normal FORT levels. Moreover, we found a potentiation of IL-1α, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-1α1 in the analyzed female compared to male children. Conclusion: The present investigation shows an imbalance in the peripheral neuroimmune pathways that could be used in children as early biomarkers of the deficits observed in FASD. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction. From the students' perspective, social loafing has also become a major challenge and problem in group tasks in the classroom. Social loafing may affect students' enthusiasm and attitude to share knowledge. Aim. This study aims to investigate the mediating effects of knowledge sharing (KS) attitudes on the relationships between KS intentions, perceived social loafing, and learning goal orientation. Methodology and research methods. This study used a game-based team learning situation to explore the students' KS attitudes and intentions. Questionnaires were also delivered to 336 students in business colleges in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The authors used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) with bootstrapping estimation to test all the hypotheses. Results and scientific novelty. The findings show that (1) perceived social loafing has a negative influence on KS attitudes and intentions; (2) learning goal orientation has a positive influence on KS attitudes and intentions; (3) KS attitudes have mediating effects on the relationships of perceived social loafing, learning goal orientation and KS intentions. Scientific novelty. This study uses business simulation games as team learning activities to verify the impact of students' attitudes and intentions on KS in the context of perceived social loafing. Practical significance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 among residents/citizens of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey on 3,920 citizens/residents from three Gulf-countries (KSA, UAE, and Kuwait) was conducted between June 15 and August 25, 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 4 items on attitudes, and 7 items on practice towards prevention and control of COVID-19. The Survey link was constructed to be available in Arabic and English. Descriptive statistics of frequency distribution and percentages were calculated, and non-parametric tests were applied to compare the mean knowledge, attitude, and practice scores among different countries. RESULTS: This study included participants from KSA (2,938, 74.9%), UAE (403, 10.3%), and Kuwait (579, 14.8%). The study subjects from KSA, UAE, and Kuwait showed significant differences in the mean knowledge (10.13, 10.52, and 9.19, p<0.001), attitude (2.84, 3.12, and 5.98, p<0.001), and practice (6.11, 5.98 and 5.38, p<0.001) scores towards COVID-19. In addition, Kuwaiti citizens and residents showed significantly lower knowledge, attitude, and practice scores toward COVID-19 than UAE and KSA participants. Participants from Kuwait showed significantly lower knowledge, attitude, and practice scores than the UAE and KSA. However, in general (38.2%), the study participants were optimistic about controlling Coronavirus. Nearly 48.6% started to take an immune-boosting diet to protect themselves from the Coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: Study participants from KSA, UAE, and Kuwait demonstrated adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and acceptable practices towards COVID-19 control. Electronic and social media should be effectively utilized to spread awareness of COVID-19 among the public. © 2022 Verduci Editore s.r.l. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Negative public perceptions of mental diseases and even therapists are among the most important obstacles to patients' therapeutic progress. Such attitudes are constructed by cultural and social structures. Through continuous reproducing and representing these attitudes, the media can strengthen the negative attitudes toward mental patients. On the other hand, the critical representation of social and cultural clichés in the media can reduce mental illness stigma. Psychiatrists should interact with the media regarding their concerns about mental illness stigma to achieve this goal; as a result, they must learn how to communicate with the media. Methods: A 5-day workshop was designed and implemented with the participation of 11 facilitators and 16 psychiatry residents from five universities in Iran. Then, a focus group session was held. Results: According to the results of the quantitative data analysis, the trainees prefer online media over traditional media, implying that they prefer interactive media platforms. Before the workshop, the trainees had believed that media coverage of psychiatry is biased and erroneous and that they should oversee the entire process of health content development by journalists. Besides, they were also interested in communicating with society. After the workshop, the focus group interview showed that the participating psychiatry residents felt that this activity improved their media literacy, enhanced their skills at interacting with the media, and encouraged them to interact more with the media in the future on health-related issues. Conclusion: Residents in psychiatry have a higher tendency for communicating with the media in the field of mental health in general. They stated that they needed to engage in the creation of popular mental health content. © Iran University of Medical Sciences

AB  - Background: Although telemedicine services have been adopted on a large scale in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a little is known about the public experience. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate consumers’ patterns, nature, and predictors of telemedicine utilization and consumers’ attitude toward this technology. Methods: A quantitative, self-administered questionnaire was developed, validated, and delivered randomly to adults living across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between January 2021 and January 2022. The questionnaire included questions about categories of telemedicine used, purpose of use, challenges encountered during the use of telemedicine, and reasons for not using telemedicine technology. We adopted a proportionate random sampling technique to recruit participants by 3 ways: social media, phone calls, and face to face. Results: The final dataset included 1584 participants, of which 496 (31.3%) used telemedicine during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The most common reasons for not using telemedicine during COVID-19 was having no idea that telemedicine exists (38.3%, 417 of 1088) or having no idea how to use it (33.5%, 365 of 1088). Telemedicine users reported that that telepharmacy (89.7%), teleconsultation (78.2%), and telediagnosis (23.0%) were the most frequently used telemedicine services during the COVID-19 crisis. Of the 496 telemedicine users, 469 (94.6%) reported using telemedicine for seeking a pharmacist advice about medication instructions, 422 (85.1%) for ordering nonprescription drugs, and 401 (80.8%) for seeking a physician advice. Those with high activity on social media were less likely to be associated with telemedicine users versus nonusers. Discussion: Although telepharmacy has been increasingly used by consumers, more attention is needed to fix its limitations and improve patient safety. Conclusion: This study shows a positive attitude and a general acceptance of telemedicine services among the UAE population. Some sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were significantly associated with the use of telemedicine during the pandemic. © 2022 American Pharmacists Association®

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccinations have reignited optimism in many cultures devastated by the pandemic's tremendous loss of lives and livelihoods. Vaccination hesitancy is a critical and growing international problem in the global effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. To successfully handle vaccination hesitancy concerns, it is necessary to understand the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to understand people’s knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes about COVID 19 and its related vaccines. Methods: In October 2021, a cross-sectional study with 232 participants was conducted. A standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Results: Most respondents in the present survey heard about COVID-19 between January and March 2020. Social media and newspapers are the most effective sources of information on COVID-19, reaching 34.48 % of the population. Basic COVID-19 knowledge was reported to be moderate. Nearly half of the respondents (48.3 %) thought SARSCOV-2 was man-made, while 36.21 % were unsure. Good preventive behaviors were indicated by 49.14 % of subjects. Overall, we find that around 65 % of people are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Male gender, low education, and occupation were shown to be more hesitant about vaccination. In this study, healthcare workers were averse to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The reasons for vaccination hesitation were "unknown safety" of the vaccines (17.4 %) and "unknown long-term consequences" of the vaccines (18.97 %). Almost a third (27.59 %) of those interviewed said they had no intention of being vaccinated. Conclusion: We report moderate knowledge on COVID-19, as well as effective preventive practices, but negative attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination, resulting in low vaccination rates of 6.9%. Misinformation regarding COVID-19 appears to play a key role in vaccination reluctance. © 2022, National Institute for Medical Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, the advertising industry has struggled to adapt to a new reality. The current study aims to explore the impact of emotional advertising during this pandemic on The Lebanese consumers’ behavior. We are particularly interested in fast-food chains due to the contradiction between their unhealthy offerings and their empathetic marketing. A convenience sample of 270 respondents was analyzed. Findings show that positive attitudes towards emotional marketing create positive actions towards the brand, which are mediated by more positive emotions towards the brand–even in times of crises. However, there was no effect of perceived lack of authenticity on attitudes or actions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Effective health communication requires various strategies. This study focused on two framing strategies closely relevant to health issues. Specifically, it examined how temporal framing moderates the effects of gain-loss framing on social distancing with particular attention to the underlying affective mechanisms of these interactions. A 2 (temporal framing: proximal vs. distal) X 2 (gain-loss framing: gain vs. loss) randomized experiment was conducted with 114 undergraduate students in Korea. The results showed that loss-framing was more effective than gain-framing when presented in temporally proximal frames, but such differences diminished when presented in temporally distal frames. The interaction effects of temporal framing and gain-loss framing had indirect effects on attitudes via fear and anger. They also had an indirect effect on intentions via fear. This study’s results enhance our understanding of framing effects by testing the interaction effects between two types of framing in the context of social distancing and clarifying affective mediating processes through which framing exerts its effects. These findings have practical implications for designing effective health messages. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study heightens the understanding of response efficacy as a determinant of engagement in preventive behavior during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve a more nuanced conceptualization of response efficacy, this study proposes and examines a time-based coping appraisal framework, drawing upon a part of the extended parallel process model (EPPM). The current study investigates how the temporality of coping response message features work in generating social distancing behavioral intentions and explicates the role of anticipated emotions in this motivational process. Results of the experimental study (N = 584) indicate that proximal future framed coping response message (vs. distant future message) led to greater response efficacy, which in turn led to greater anticipated guilt and pride, and by extension increased social distancing behavioral intentions. Mediation analyses also demonstrated the indirect effects of the temporality conditions (proximal future-oriented message vs. distant future-oriented message) on social distancing intentions through response efficacy, anticipated guilt, and anticipated pride. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Understanding when, to what extent, and in which contexts high-profile police actions influence trust in and legitimacy of the police is important because police perceptions are associated with cooperation, compliance and, eventually, trust in the state itself. The current study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess changes in public attitudes toward the police after the violent police dispersal of a protest movement against a new railway station project in Stuttgart on 30 September 2010. We found little to no change in several dimensions of perceptions of police and legitimacy, specifically measures of trust in police, moral alignment, procedural fairness, and obligation to obey the police. However, respondents interviewed after the event saw the police as more unduly influenced by political pressure. The results suggest that the impact of high-profile incidents of police violence may depend on institutional context, media response, and post-incident reconciliation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Islamist terrorist attacks and existing terror threat can seriously affect intergroup relations and policy making. Drawing on hostile media effect theory and intergroup threat theory, we hypothesized that perceived threat of terror influences perceived news media bias in favor of Muslims as well as support for surveillance policies that are perceived to be restrictive for Muslims. In addition, we assumed that media bias positively predicts surveillance policy support. Results of a quota-based two-wave panel survey (N T2 = 524) revealed that perceived threat of terror increased perceived media bias in favor of Muslims over time, but did not have a direct effect over time on support for surveillance policies. However, perceived media bias was found to be a positive predictor of support for surveillance policies over time. In addition, support for policies was a positive predictor of perceived terror threat over time, suggesting a vicious cycle. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: The effectiveness of the national drug safety monitoring program directly depends on the active participation of healthcare professionals in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aim of the study was to explore community pharmacists’ comprehension of pharmacovigilance, their perspectives toward reporting ADRs and investigate the current practice of ADR reporting among pharmacists in Serbia. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of pharmacists in Serbia between November 2019 and March 2020 using a pre-tested questionnaire distributed online. Eligible participants were community pharmacists in Serbia who were willing to participate in the study during the data collection period. Non-parametric statistical tests were performed in the analysis of knowledge, perspectives and ADR reporting. The validity and reliability of the survey were measured by exploratory factor analysis. Results: The median knowledge score was 6 out of 10 (interquartile range 5–7, range 2–10). No significant differences in the knowledge scores of pharmacists were found based on weekly working hours (U = 24,805, p =.374), working experience (χ 2 = 4.011, DF = 2, p =.135), being a member of a professional organization (U = 24,312, p =.209), or highest level of pharmacy qualification obtained (χ 2 = 3.233, DF = 3, p =.506). Only 28.8% of pharmacists reported ADR at least once a year, while the majority of them have never reported any ADRs. Conclusions: Despite the community pharmacists’ positive attitude toward adverse drug reporting and their role in the process, they show limited knowledge regarding the issue and highly prevalent under-reporting of ADRs. Educational programs are necessary to increase ADRs reporting. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the rise of social media in people’s lives, the tendency to donate through social media platforms has increased tremendously. The positive attitudes of social media users towards online charity initiatives, such as ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, are also gaining traction. Therefore, it is of great value for the charitable organizations to identify the motivational factors that encourage social media users to participate in blatant benevolence. Drawing on costly signalling and self-presentation theories, this study undertakes a multi-method approach with the aim to explore social media users’ motivation of posting prosocial behaviour on social media platforms by identifying the antecedents of blatant benevolence. Using the interview data from 126 social media users, the study first applies rigorous grounded theory analysis to identify factors that lead to blatant benevolence, and subsequently employs a survey method approach, comprising data from 342 social media users, to empirically test the factors identified. Our findings show that desire for social network enhancement and warm glow attainment are the significant drivers that motivate people to post prosocial behaviours on social media. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings for social media behaviour researchers and charity organizations are also discussed in the paper. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - To maintain social distancing in the long term, in the current COVID-19 scenario, people’s motivation must be strong and of high quality. Many governments adopted measures enforcing social distancing. Enforcement, however, can produce feelings of defiance and backfiring effects. The present work aims at investigating the relationship between autonomous motivation and intentions to maintain social distancing, through adherence to recommendations and feelings of defiance. A sample of 502 Italian residents, from different parts of Italy, completed an online survey assessing their present behavior, levels of autonomous motivation and feelings of defiance, as well as intentions to observe social distancing in the short and long term. Results support the hypotheses that autonomous motivation is related to stronger intentions to maintain social distancing, particularly in the long term, and that feelings of defiance mediate this relationship. These results underline importance of promoting understanding and internalizing reasons for social distancing, beyond norms. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: The first national COVID-19 lockdown in the United Kingdom between March to July 2020 resulted in sudden and unprecedented disruptions to daily life. This study sought to understand the impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing and quarantine, on people's lived experiences, focusing on social connections and relationships. Methods: Data were generated through 20 in-depth online and telephone interviews, conducted between May and July 2020, and analysed using thematic analysis informed by an ecological framework. Results: Findings show that the use of NPIs impacted social relationships and sociality at every level, disrupting participant's sense of self; relationships with their partners, household members, neighbours, and communities; and polarising social and political views. However, experiences of personal meaning-making and reflection, and greater social connectedness, solidarity, and compassion - despite physical distance - were also common. Conclusions: Participant's lived experiences of the first UK lockdown underscore the interconnectedness of relationships at the individual, community and societal level and point towards the important role of trust, social cohesion, and connectedness in coping with pandemic stress and adversity. Where infectious disease prevention measures rupture sociality, support for social connection at every relational level is likely to help build resilience in light of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. © 2022 Schneiders ML et al.

AB  - Background: Levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate are common emergency oral contraceptives (EOCs). Lack of knowledge and negative attitude toward EOCs pose barriers to the EOCs access and utilization. Aim: This study aimed to summarize the studies on the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare providers and patients on the use of EOCs. Method: A systematic search was conducted from conception to April 2022 using the following databases: CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Thai Journal Online. Data were extracted independently and were meta-analyzed using DerSimonian and Laird method for the binary random-effects model. Results: 121 articles with a total number of 92,484 participants were included. The awareness of levonorgestrel as an EOC was 66.7% while the awareness of ulipristal acetate as an EOC was 36.9%. EOCs users received EOC information mainly from the internet, media, and friends. We found that 32.2% of EOCs users and providers agreed that EOCs acted post-fertilization, and 39.8% of the prescribers know the correct time to take the pill postcoital. Negative attitudes toward EOC use were found in 25.4% of the participants. For example, 39.4% of the participants agreed that EOCs users had increased sexual activity. Conclusion: The awareness of EOCs was low and misunderstandings or negative attitudes towards the use or prescription of EOCs were still prevalent. Educating healthcare providers, using media as educational tools, and improving education and economics can be useful in improving EOC users' awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards EOCs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objective – This research project sought to determine if audio feedback in literature searches can increase the social presence of the library and create a positive view of the library service. It also explored the process of recording and sending audio feedback; tested its practicality, sustainability, and accessibility; and ascertained whether audio feedback enhanced the library’s communication, thereby creating a positive attitude toward the library and its services. Methods – The research was conducted in a small virtual library and information service. The research sample consisted of all library users and clinicians who requested a mediated literature search between July 2019 and July 2020. All participants were sent an audio commentary on their search results, recorded by the librarian, and were asked to respond to an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of five statements. The study participants indicated their agreement or disagreement with each statement on a five-point Likert scale. Results – The researcher sent out 96 audio commentaries, generating 31 responses to the questionnaire. The results indicated that users felt the audio feedback improved their understanding of the results of their inquiry, made them feel more comfortable about using the library, enhanced their experience of communicating with the library and provided a better experience than just receiving an email. The responses broadly supported the contention that audio commentaries created social presence and generated a positive view of the library. Conclusion – The researcher found that delivering audio feedback was both practical and sustainable. Some consideration was given to individual learning styles and how these made audio or text feedback more or less effective. Specifically, audio feedback enhanced communications better than an email alone. © 2022. Holland.

AB  - This paper revisits the longstanding question of why segregation douses ethnic tensions in some places but exacerbates them in others. Anchored on the concept of social distance and drawing on empirical evidence from Jos, Nigeria’s hotbed of ethnoterritorial conflict, this article provides a nuanced analysis of why segregation mediates both the emergence and the prevention of ethnic conflict. In the examined case study, the role of social distance in conflict mitigation varies according to neighbourhood type. Animosity was already deep-seated across the region when social distancing–the effect of partition and segregation–was cemented following the outbreak of conflict in some communities in 2001. Yet the conflict spread to some ethnically unmixed neighbourhoods but not others. In conflict-affected areas, social distance did not avert future conflicts compared to neighbourhoods where the initial conflict was avoided. However, past conflict is not a predictor of future outbreaks in socially distanced neighbourhoods given that in the areas that avoided future conflicts, social distance occurred simultaneously with extensive informal bi-communal leadership engagements. Therefore, the paper shows that even imperfect unmixing can dampen violence when combined with observable leadership engagement. © 2022 Global South Ltd.

AB  - From the mid-1940s to the fall of the Colonels’ Dictatorship in 1974, Greek society was defined by an official anti-communist discourse that divided it into ‘nationally-minded’ Ethnikofron citizens and left-wing ‘enemies of the nation’. The article shows how this power discourse deployed visual media to construct an emotional regime of fear around communism during and after the Greek Civil War. It uncovers a large volume of propaganda imagery, including posters, illustrations, book covers, photographs, newsreels and feature films, which was used alongside texts and corporeal practices to vilify the Greek left. The article argues that the visual language of Ethnikofrosyni patterned itself on older scripts of negative othering embedded in Greek popular culture, such as lycanthropy, teratology, witchcraft, Islamophobia and Orientalism to discredit communism without engaging with its twentieth-century ideas and policies. Communists were therefore portrayed as monsters, beasts, barbarians, Muslims, Turks, Jews and unfeminine women to arouse primordial fears that threatened the deepest symbols of Greek national identity. The article stresses the centrality and relative autonomy of images in the discourse of Ethnikofrosyni and uses comparisons to unveil the processes of circulation and domestication operating across different national strands of anti-communism in the Cold War. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines how characteristics of victims and types of incidents described in a media account of gun violence affect public support for three categories of policies that regulate firearms. Methods: A randomized experiment with a sample of US public (N = 3410). Results: Victim race, particularly if the victim was Black, was a strong predictor of less public support for all tested categories of firearm regulation. Respondents were less supportive of policies to address gun suicide or accidents and more supportive of policy solutions to mass shootings, compared to street-level gun homicides. Depictions of victim gender, mental illness, prior incarceration, and age were less salient to support across categories of firearm regulation, compared to race and type of incident. Conclusions: Media coverage of gun violence has heterogenous effects on public support for firearm regulation and may influence support for policies aimed at reducing specific types of gun violence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Existing literature tends to analyse the long-term evolution of the far right’s world-view rather than how it responds to short-term events. This exploratory study, however, analyses how the far right in Norway framed the unprecedented global crisis of COVID-19. The data encompasses 149 Facebook posts, online op-eds, columns, letters to the editor and YouTube videos about COVID-19 published between 1 January and 31 May 2020 by two radical-right parties, three anti-immigration/anti-Islam groups, one neo-Nazi social movement, one long-time neo-Nazi solo activist and a leading alternative media website in Norway. They represent the full range of established and new, minor and leading, and radical and extreme far-right actors from the last four decades. Based on the material analysed, Mjelde identifies four overarching frames related to the world order, governance, immigration and conspiracies, as well as nine subframes. A main finding is that conspiratorial distrust of the government constitutes a master frame that both the radical and the extreme right combine with other frames that reflect key tenets of their world-view. The findings underscore, first, the rigidity of the far right’s world-view; second, contradictory views within the far right about the remedy for the pandemic and the state’s role; and, finally, that China is emerging as a bogeyman on the US/Trump-friendly far right. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The relationship between Islam and Portugal is intimately tied to processes of national formation and diverse in terms of the key protagonists, historical periods, and political conjunctures that it evokes – hence it is particularly suited for the contextualised study of Islamophobia. Drawing on a larger European study, and specifically on discourse analysis and empirical research on the Portuguese context, this article examines, on the one hand, narratives on Muslims and Islam circulating in the academic literature and in cyberspace (2000–20); on the other, different expressions of Islamophobia – individual and institutional (Sayyid 2014a): i) a case of mosque vandalism and practices of media reporting; ii) concerns regarding educational equality raised by research participants, namely regarding school organisation and history teaching. Engaging with the intrinsic instability of the category Muslim – across historical junctures, political contexts, and academic disciplines – this article calls for an engagement with Islamophobia beyond the national register (Vakil 2010), revealing how the wider circulation of public discourse and interventions constrains the possibility of articulating Muslim political subjectivities. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

AB  - Objective: To report alcohol consumption during the first month of social home-isolation and physical distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in an public University in Mid-West Brazil. Methods: We designed an online observational study. Initial data of 2166 participants was obtained between April and May, 2020, less than a month after University’s measures of social distancing with remote work and classes. We used Poisson regression model with robust variance to identify the significant factors associated with self-reported increase in alcohol consumption during social and physical distancing measures. Results: Increased alcohol consumption during social and physical distancing was reported by 22.9% of 1371 alcohol drinkers. Factors associated with reporting increased alcoholic consumption during University’s physical and social distancing measures were: not professing any religion (1.52, 95% CI 1.25-1.83), having signs/symptom suggesting SARS-COV-2 infection (1.56, 95% CI 1.26-1.93), missing social interaction with peers carried out without any mediating technology (1.57, 95% CI 1.13-2.20), experiencing financial distress/hardship (1.25, 95% CI 1.02-1.54), perceiving duration of social isolation as long (1.62, 95% CI 1.10-2.41), reporting worsening of emotional/mental wellbeing (1.76, 95% CI 1.34-2.33), and previous psychological disorders (1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.52). Conclusions: This study highlights several individual, psychological, and social determinants of increase in consumption of alcoholic beverages during physical and social distancing measures due to the pandemic and the results may reflect the presence of emotional changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It urges that sanitary authorities adopt measures to avoid excessive alcohol consumption during social distancing measures. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The social distancing and lockdown measures enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic entailed an unprecedented shift to digitally-mediated communication. The move to remote learning at schools was one of such important changes. Drawing on privacy and STS literature, we investigate the role of different privacy cultures during the initial moment of turbulence, when schools had to quickly adapt to remote teaching. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with teachers in Israel and Germany. Our interviews carved out three distinct phases: A moment of turbulence, a period of negotiation and a phase of temporary closure, leading to the dominance of Zoom and Google Classroom in Israel, and government-mandated open-source tools for German teachers. These different pathways are shaped by considerations of vertical privacy among German teachers, and the absence of such considerations on the part of Israeli teachers. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Based on Bourdieu’s cultural capital theory, our study examined the engagement of newly arrived children (NAC) with ICT and e-sports both at home and in school in the context of Hong Kong. Our in-depth case study of a Hong Kong secondary school revealed that the selected NAC typically came from disadvantaged school and immigrant family backgrounds. They had limited access to technology and little parental mediation at home. The results also showed that as these NAC excessively used ICT at home for multiplayer online games, they became active e-sports players with good ICT skills. These students created an e-sports culture in the school, which was supported by their teachers and the principal. Contrary to their parents’ conservative and negative attitude towards a career in e-sports or the ICT industry, the principal and teachers viewed e-sports as an alternative way for their students to accumulate capital and provide them with opportunities for upward social mobility. The findings demonstrate the importance of education in bridging the digital divide of NAC and helping them accumulate the digital dimension of cultural capital. © 2022, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Aims: Little is known about the influence of parents’ screen media habits and attitudes towards screen media on children’s screen use. We investigated associations of parental screen use, their smartphone addiction and screen media attitudes, with children’s recreational screen use. Methods: This study was based on a population-based cross-sectional survey sent between May 2019 and November 2020 to a random sample of 6820 Danish parent–child dyads who answered questions regarding their screen media habits. Children were 6–11 years of age and had to reside with the parent. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were conducted (in October 2021) separately for screen media use on weekdays and weekend days. Results: The analyses included 5437 parents (41.0 years, 67.6% girls) and 5437 children (8.9 years, 48.2% girls). The adjusted relative odds of excessive amounts of screen use of children (>3 hours/weekday and >4 hours/weekend day) was 5.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6; 7.3) on weekdays and 7.2 (95% CI 5.9; 8.8) on weekend days comparing the fourth and first quartile of parental screen use. Children of parents in the fourth quartile of parental screen use had 2.1 (95% CI 1.7; 2.5) and 2.5 (95% CI 2.2; 3.0) greater odds of screen use before bedtime on all week and weekend days, respectively. Children of parents who had a positive attitude towards their child’s screen use or were at high risk of smartphone addiction had significantly higher screen use and more frequent problematic screen use. Conclusions: Parent’s screen media habits and attitudes were strongly associated with their children’s recreational screen use. © Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Adolescents with positive attitudes towards the legal authorities are unlikely to adopt delinquent behaviours. To examine the role school can play in shaping such attitudes, we questioned 465 middle school students to assess how their emotional relationships with teachers (teachers’ compassionate love, teachers’ esteem) relate to their attitudes towards authority (trust in the justice system, positive evaluation of the law). We also assessed whether these associations were mediated by school belonging. Results showed that teachers’ compassionate love and teachers’ esteem were (respectively) directly and indirectly linked to students’ attitudes towards authority. In both cases, school belonging acted as either a partial or a total mediator. This is consistent with the group engagement model and suggests that students’ attitudes towards legal authorities are linked to their affective relationships with teachers, partly because their positive perceptions of teacher-student relationships strengthen their feelings of school membership. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - National identity is the cognition of citizens regarding to which political community they belong, and the tendency to accept the political, cultural and ethnic values of the state. Previous studies have found that national identity is heterogeneous at the subnational levels. Why do people hold different degrees of nationalism and patriotism in the subnational units? In this paper, we offer a political economic explanation of national identity, which links the state capacity with political attitudes. We employ a nationalism-patriotism framework to decompose the concept of national identity, then use the supervised learning approach to measure nationalism and patriotism based on a massive number of Weibo posts dating from 2011 to 2017. Automated text analysis shows that the state capacity plays an important role preventing the national identity from being weakened by globalization and the diversity of social information. Specifically, with the progress of China’s globalization, multiculturalism and various information have crossed the national boundaries, which undermines China’s national identity. In order to maintain this identity, the Chinese government utilizes its redistribution capacity to reinforce both nationalism and patriotism, and also its information capacity to strengthen nationalism. © 2022, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered before and during the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. METHODS: This is an ecological, time series study based on data from the National Immunization Program. Differences between the median number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered in Brazil and in its regions before (from April/2019 to March/2020) and after (from April/2020 to March/2021) the implementation of social distancing measures in the country were assessed via the Mann-Whitney test. Prais-Winsten regression models were used for time series analyses. RESULTS: We found a reduction in the median number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered in Brazil and in its regions: North (-34.71%), Midwest (-21.72%), South (-63.50%), and Southeast (-34.42%) (p < 0.05). Series showed stationary behavior in Brazil and in its five regions during the covid-19 pandemic (p > 0.05). Brazilian states also showed stationary trends, except for two states which recorded an increasing trend in the number of administered yellow fever vaccine doses, namely: Alagoas State (before: β = 64, p = 0.081; after: β = 897, p = 0.039), which became a yellow fever vaccine recommendation zone, and Roraima State (before: β = 68, p = 0.724; after: β = 150, p = 0.000), which intensified yellow fever vaccinations due to a yellow fever case confirmation in a Venezuelan State in 2020. CONCLUSION: The reduced number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered during the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil may favor the reemergence of urban yellow fever cases in the country. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original author and source are credited.

AB  - This paper analyzes the relationship between the Mexican President's discourse on Covid-19 and the use of Twitter by state officials at the start of the pandemic, through content analysis and supervised machine learning. Analyzing all tweets by state-level agencies during the first 6 months of the pandemic, we found that accounts belonging to the ruling party tweeted consistently less about Covid, compared to the opposition. Furthermore, the social-distancing hashtags endorsed by the Health Department were underused by the party's own officials. We hypothesized that the president's skeptical discourse on Covid-19 had a chilling effect on party officials' use of Twitter during this period. Two random forest machine learning models were trained using the president's words as predictors not only of the officials' political alignment, but also of the amount of Covid tweets they posted. The models proved reliable, and the words most significant for prediction are markedly indicative of populist rhetoric. This illustrates how populist discourse from heads of government can undermine communication between institutions and citizens. © 2022 Universidade Nova de Lisboa - Center for Media Research and Journalism.

AB  - This study tests whether the consequences of cross-cutting exposure (CCE) to political news on affective polarization depend on the type of media individuals consume. Findings from the 2020 American National Election Studies panel data suggest that CCE to cable TV news, a medium frequently described as uncivil, may increase negative affect toward the out-party candidate, and that such effect may be mediated by feelings of anger and certainty in one’s political attitudes. These insights draw attention to elite incivility, in addition to citizens’ partisan predispositions, as a potential contributor to the growing affective divide in American politics. © 2022 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - The popular concept of “finding common ground” suggests that recognizing similarities, as opposed to differences, can lead to positive interactions among group members. This adage is supported by the literature on intergroup contact theory, with research indicating that a key pillar in mitigating intergroup bias is positive and meaningful intergroup contact. Similarity attraction theory suggests similar findings—primarily that individuals are attracted to those similar to themselves, which elicit positive affect in interpersonal interactions. This literature offers valuable insights for individualswho take part in interactions inwhich favorable outcomes are dependent on effective intergroup interaction, such as negotiation. While thorough research has been conducted on the benefits of similarity in interpersonal interactions, surprisingly little work has examined how perceptions of similarity affect one’s evaluations of a negotiation counterpart or the negotiation process when the negotiating counterpart is an out-group member. The present study tests the effect of focusing on similarities versus differences on attitudes toward a forthcoming negotiation and perceptions of the negotiation partner, and whether perceived similarity mediates the impact on attitudes toward the negotiation. Drawing from the research on imagined contact, we simulated a negotiation via vignette, gave U.S.-based participants (N = 530; female = 306, male = 223, nonbinary = 1) a writing task manipulation, and asked them to complete measures to assess similarity, perceptions of their negotiating counterpart’s intelligence, reluctance to compromise, and optimism toward negotiation. Results showed that focusing on similarities between oneself and one’s negotiation partner significantly improved attitudes toward the negotiation process, willingness to compromise, and perceptions of the other’s intelligence. Perceived similarity mediated the relationship between our manipulated writing task and both the participants’ willingness to compromise and their optimism toward the negotiation. Our findings add to the research on the effects of similarity salience in the specific context of negotiation settings and suggest that focusing on similarities with out-group members in negotiations presents practical benefits for conflict resolution processes © 2022.

AB  - Background: Food labeling is a fundamental educational tool for advocating for public awareness. It emphasizes knowledge of the nutrient content of food and thus directs the choice towards the healthiest food products. This cross-sectional survey aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding nutrition label use in Lebanon through a valid questionnaire. Methods: Overall, 768 participants (mean age: 30.8 ±12, males: 60.2%) were recruited randomly between February and May 2020. We used word of mouth and social media to recruit our sample population. Results: Social media was the most accessed tool to attain nutrition information by responders (39.8%). More than half the participants expressed positive attitudes to check information related to sugars (66.4%), vitamins (64.9%), total fats (61.7%), proteins (59.1%), and calories (58.7%) on the food label. Expiry date, price, and brand name were the top three considerations while reading food labels. About half (46.5%) reported to 'always' look at the food label. Responders reported reading labels related primarily to sugars (44.3%), calories (38.8%), and total fats (36.8%). The optimal total KAP score was 46; our findings revealed a mean KAP score of 14.46 ±7 (31.4%). When categorizing the KAP scores, 15% had high scores, and 85% scored low. Spearman's coefficients showed positive correlations between knowledge-attitude, knowledge-practice, and attitude-practice scores, with p<0.001. The regression analysis revealed that gender, age, BMI, residency area, educational level, university degree, health and diet statuses, and activity level were significant predictors of the KAP score. Being on a diet had the highest odds (OR=3.107, CI=1.904-5.072, p<0.001). Conclusion: The low awareness of food labels leads Lebanese people to choose unhealthy food options. A planned educational program is recommended to ease the interpretation of these labels. © 2022 Hoteit M et al.

AB  - This qualitative study was conducted using a content analysis approach. Purposeful sampling was performed with 28 participants (21 mothers and seven fathers) through in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews, two focus group discussions, and five interviews with key informants. All interviews were recorded and typed. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and software MAXqda2010. Analysis of participants’ perspectives and experiences showed the three categories including (1) Challenges of sexual health education (challenge between tradition and modernity, poor parental self-efficacy, cultural resistance, inadequate parental sexual knowledge and matching with socio-cultural developments, lack of access to valid educational references and government counseling services, parents’ negative attitude towards sexual issues and poor parent-child interactions), (2) The necessity of sexual health education (strengthening of self-control skill in adolescents, reduction in high-risk behaviors, enhancement of sexual self-esteem, emotional and sexual damage, reduction in media and cyberspace and satellite misuse), and (3) Parents’ educational needs for sexual health (physical changes of puberty, psychological characteristics of puberty, cognition and ways to prevent high-risk behaviors, ways to manage offspring’s sexual behaviors, communication skills between parents and children, mutual perception and building trust, and commitment and responsibility of parents towards the sexual education of the offspring). © 2022 College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists.

AB  - The efforts to promote healthy eating remain ineffective. The inability of these campaigns to counter the marketing resources of the mainstream fast-food chains is among the primary explanations for such failures. However, from the information processing perspective, the message’s features may also play a significant role. Cue reactivity research has shown the importance of evaluating visual and verbal cues to avoid undesirable addictive behavioral outcomes. Bridging the evaluative space model (ESM) and the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP), the goal of this experiment is to further explore how food-related visual and verbal cues elicit psychophysiological reactivity and how this reactivity in turn affects attitudes toward the promotion. Multilevel modeling results showed that healthy food images paired with encouragement words elicited an uncoupled pattern of the appetitive system activation and received a predominantly positive attitude from audiences (N = 180). Results suggested that thematic congruent messages are preferred in health communication settings. Junk food images, regardless of being paired with encouragement or discouragement verbal cues, should be avoided due to their automatic activation of the appetitive motivational system. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and correlations of the perceived religious affiliation on a fictitious terrorism case. Participants were 402 French adults who completed a questionnaire after reading a scenario involving the arrest of a person (French vs. North African; man vs. woman) wearing an explosive belt. They indicated the level of the perpetrator’s religious affiliation and judged her/him and the act. The participants’ level of social dominance orientation (SDO) was measured and studied along in its two dimensions. The results showed an effect of ethnicity on perceived religious affiliation, which was correlated with judgment and mediated the effect of social dominance on judgment. The implications of this study are discussed in terms of intergroup interactions and religious prejudice. © 2022 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.

AB  - Stereotyping has always permeated inter-ethnic understanding, conflating knowledge with prejudice. The seventeenth century European image of the Cape indigenous peoples was bound by a sustained ideological bias. The so-called “echo chamber of the discourse of the Cape” captured the Cape Khoi as primitive beasts in a negation of Christian values, and meant that knowledge about the Cape Khoi did not actually advance (Coetzee). In this paper I show that the Dutchman Jan Willem van Grevenbroek, VOC clerk at the Cape from 1684 to 1694, did in fact challenge the prevailing European image about the Khoi, then commonly called “Hottentots.” In a Latin letter, he positions himself against negative primitivism and interprets Khoi customs as authentically Christian. However, Grevenbroek thus risks being drawn into an oppositional discourse that limits the possibilities for renegotiating stereotypes (Hall; Matusitz). At the same time, he strategically demonstrates that the stereotype contains no inherent knowledge about the people and thus exploits one of the few possibilities to open ideological discourse up to renegotiation (Hall). Grevenbroek’s position challenges the very notion of there ever having been a single, colonial discourse (White), which makes Grevenbroek a valuable voice in Cape history, post-colonial discourse, and the history of knowledge in South Africa and beyond. © 2022 Critical Arts.

AB  - Objective: We argue the January 6th, 2021, insurrection represents the culmination of a breakdown of intergroup dialogue in the U.S.We further argue that group psychologists and group psychotherapists can help us understand the antecedents and outcomes of this breakdown and provide a productive way forward through fostering and facilitating intergroup dialogue and researching the process and outcomes of this small group intervention. Method: We review research related to some of the antecedents of a breakdown of dialogue across groups in the U.S. (e.g., affective polarization and social media) to highlight a need for more meaningful intergroup contact that reduces political and other identity-based (e.g., racial) segregation and builds intergroup understanding and empathy. Results: We illustrate how intergroup dialogue, a small group intervention, can help begin to address some of the antecedents and consequences of the breakdown in dialogue that preceded the insurrection on a local level. Conclusion: We conclude that group psychologists and group psychotherapists should devote efforts to understanding the process and outcomes of difficult intergroup dialogues (including how to increase participation in these dialogues), and use their group work skills to facilitate these dialogues on a local level. © 2022.

AB  - When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, countries around the world began enacting lockdown measures and enforcing social distancing rules. Almost at the same time, the use of drones also began to see a spike, especially in the hands of civilian users. This article examines the phenomenon of the drone video as a genre of the pandemic. While drone imagery is not endemic to the COVID-19 crisis, in the face of mass deaths and lockdowns, drone users globally began to turn to the drone as a mobile archive machine. Drawing on recent scholarship on drones, I examine how the drone’s vertical vision afforded a form of pandemic witnessed by proxy. Despite the increasing use of drones for policing, surveillance and warfare, in the case of India, drone imagery also played an important role in countering government narratives about the pandemic and its body counts. Examining the drone images captured by the late photographer Danish Siddiqui, I demonstrate how the drone’s ‘vertical play’ facilitated the emergence of a counter-archive of the pandemic. © 2022 Screen South Asia Trust.

AB  - Background: Organ transplantation is the most effective medical procedure to save people who are suffering from terminal organ failure. However, shortages of transplantable organs remain a universal problem. Although more than 90% of the U.S. population supports the concept of organ donation, only 60% are registered donors. Method: A 2 (other-benefit appeal vs. self-benefit appeal) × 2 (nonscarcity vs. scarcity appeal) online experiment (N = 312) was conducted to examine how sympathy and fear mediate the interplay between benefit and scarcity appeal in organ donation messages. Results: Other-benefit appeal message generated more sympathy than self-benefit appeal message in organ donation. The nonscarcity condition generated more positive attitudes toward organ donation than the scarcity condition. Sympathy and fear, respectively, exerted a significant impact on attitude and organ donation intentions under the nonscarcity and scarcity conditions. Conclusion: The results revealed that both sympathy and fear are underlying mechanisms that can change people’s attitudes and intentions of organ donation through different routes. Sympathy motivates people through altruism to reduce others’ suffering, whereas fear motivates people through viewing organ donation behavior as a value to help themselves cope with the fear of death. Because organ donation can remind people of their own death, resource scarcity can exacerbate people’s self-related fear of death, which may motivate them to suppress organ donation-related thoughts, rather than use organ donation as a defensive mechanism to cope with fear of death. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the way Americans deal with death and dying. Social distancing restrictions prevented or delayed end of life services for families who lost loved ones to COVID-19. Alternatively, some took to the internet to express their grief through online memorialization. Using content analysis, this study analyzes 200 randomly selected online memorials from the COVID Memorial website, a website created to share the stories of those lost to COVID-19 on social media. Our findings offer insight into memorial author demographics, how memorial authors framed and understood death due to COVID-19, and the COVID-19 pandemic through online memorialization. Two major themes emerged during data analysis, “references to COVID-19 death” and “COVID-specific directives to readers.” The former, details how memorial authors framed and understood the death of a loved one to COVID-19. The latter details “advice” or “directives” authors gave to readers about social distancing guidelines and other guidelines meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Vaginismus is a sexual dysfunction occurring in females presented as a contraction of the muscles around the vagina as a reflex, causing the failure of vaginal penetration. Although many psychological, social, and cultural factors that may cause vaginismus have been suggested, its underlying mechanisms are not clear. The aim of this study was to determine the sexual attitude, sexual self-awareness, and sociocultural status of women with and without lifelong vaginismus. This is a case-control study. A total of 148 women were included in the study: 74 women with a lifelong vaginismus diagnosis and 74 women without a history of vaginismus/painful sexual activity controls. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, the Sexual Self-Consciousness Scale, and the Hendrick Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale. Sexual shyness (OR = 0.854), sexual self-focus (OR = 0.888) and birth control (OR = 1.279), communion (OR = 1.198), and instrumentality (OR = 1.330; the sub-dimensions of the Sexual Attitude Scale) were associated with (χ2 = 96.130, p &lt;.001) vaginismus at the rate of 63%. Those who did not receive sexual information; those who obtained information about sexuality from the social media; those who had negative thoughts about sexuality due to religious reasons; those who found the genitals and sexuality as disgusting; and those having more feelings of fear and pain are more likely to have vaginismus. Some socio-cultural factors may negatively affect women and cause vaginismus. Women with vaginismus had low sexual self-consciousness and negative attitudes toward sexuality. It may be incomplete to consider vaginismus only as a vaginal entry problem. Therefore, in the treatment of vaginismus, women’s sexual attitude, sexual self-awareness, and sociocultural factors should be evaluated in a holistic manner. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: Following the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing restrictions limited access to face-to-face mental health services in Western Australia (WA), necessitating a rapid transition to non-face-to-face alternatives, including telehealth. The current study investigated barriers and facilitators to telehealth access and engagement, and preferences for child and youth mental health service delivery during and beyond COVID-19. Methods: Three participant groups were recruited via social media and partner organisations, and completed a tailored online survey: i) young people (14–25 years) who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services (n = 84), ii) parents of young people with a child aged 0–25 years who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services with or on behalf of their child (n = 68), and iii) professionals working in the child or youth mental health sector (n = 167). Results: Regarding barriers to engagement, young people were primarily concerned with the privacy implications of telehealth and its efficacy relative to face-to-face alternatives. Parents and clinicians were more concerned with the technological pitfalls of telehealth (e.g., internet-connectivity, picture/sound issues). Telehealth’s accessibility was highlighted as a facilitator for all groups. Although certain participant groups were considered to be more suited to telehealth than others, most participants endorsed a blended approach to the future provision of mental health services. Conclusions: To facilitate a blended approach to the delivery of child and youth mental health services, participants recommended more reliable and affordable internet access, implementing funding models that support telehealth delivery, and training for clinical staff. KEY POINTS: What is already known about this topic: At the time of writing, Western Australia has been fortunate enough to resist a large-scale outbreak of COVID-19, making the state relatively unique in its experience of the pandemic. Despite this, the state has experienced periods of social distancing requirements and associated impact on mental health service provision. Young people have been especially susceptible to mental health decline during the pandemic. Social distancing requirements have necessitated the rapid transition of mental health service provision from face-to-face to non-face-to-face alternatives. What this topic adds: Findings from this study provide localised insights into barriers and facilitators to engagement with non-face-to-face service delivery from the perspective of children and young people, carers and mental health professionals. Despite concerns about the relative efficacy of telehealth compared to traditional face-to-face services and challenges with technology, the majority of young people, parents, and mental health professionals in the study felt that moving forwards, child and youth mental health services should be provided using a flexible, blended approach where both face-to-face and non-face-to-face options are available. © 2022 Australian Psychological Society.

AB  - Supporters of American Indian mascots claim that these mascots honor American Indians. If this is the case, then those who have more contact with, and are more supportive of, these mascots would logically demonstrate support for American Indian Peoples in other ways. In this study, we break new ground by employing a cultivation and social learning approach to examine possible associations between greater exposure to American Indian mascots and prejudice toward American Indians, as well as support for their rights. We used an online survey of 903 White Americans to examine associations between long-term exposure to American Indian mascots, attitudes toward Native appropriation, and support for American Indian Peoples. We found that greater exposure to sport media and more contact with American Indian mascots were associated with more prejudice toward and less support for American Indian rights, via double mediators—first via less opposition to American Indian mascots, and second via less opposition to other types of Native appropriation. These findings provide further evidence that American Indian mascots are harmful to American Indians, in this case via their association with higher levels of modern prejudice, less feelings of warmth, and less support for American Indian Nation sovereignty and trust relationship with the United States government. Further, our findings suggest that this harm may be related to lessons learned from the general phenomenon of Native appropriation, which includes acceptance of objectification and dehumanization of American Indians, disregard for their feelings, and legitimation of White settler colonial power. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examines the Twitter network discussing the inclusion of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans woman Olympian, during the 2020 Tokyo Games. By analyzing the Twitter reactions, top opinion leaders, and the modularity of the network, this study uncovers that (a) the majority of the top 10 most-liked tweets and the top influential social actors hold a negative attitude toward Laurel Hubbard’s participation in the women’s category; (b) compared to traditional news agencies, social media influencers and newly launched digital media agencies play a more important role in facilitating the flow of information in this network; and (c) the observed Twitter network is highly clustered, indicating that individuals tend to interact with people more frequently within their segregated subgroup, whereas information diffusion across clusters is more restricted. This research contributes to the understanding of how Twitter users perceive the inclusion of trans athletes at international sporting events by empirically exploring the Twitter network of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans female athlete in Olympic history. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant percentage of people are vaccinated. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes toward vaccines. Objective: This study aims to identify if the social media usage factors can predict Arab people’s attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries, and 217 Arab nationals participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants, 56.2% (n = 122) were willing to get the vaccines, and 41.5% (n = 90) were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usage factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. However, some social media usage factors could predict public attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, compared to infrequent social media users, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 was being exaggerated (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 0.86–9.45, p =.046). On the other hand, participants with more trust in vaccine information shared by their contacts were less likely to agree that decision-makers had ensured the safety of vaccines (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.276–1.012, p =.05). Conclusion: Information shared on social media may affect public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated information about the COVID-19 vaccines on social media is important to increase public trust and counter the impact of incorrect misinformation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The present study investigated the process by which family context shapes social media use and relationship violence. Qualtrics online panel data was self-reported by a representative sample of 18-year-old men and women (n = 702). Results show that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are significantly associated with youth feeling disconnected from parents. ACEs were also associated with higher-risk online behaviors (such as sexting and cyberbullying). In turn, cyberbullying victimization was associated with recent experiences of relationship violence. Parent-youth disconnectedness also contributed to less positive attitudes toward social media and hindered future-oriented thinking among youth. This lack of future orientation was directly associated with increased reports of relationship violence. Findings illustrate how childhood patterns of interpersonal difficulties can perpetuate into youth peer and romantic relationships. This is consistent with a toxic stress response where sources of strain, such as negative family or online experiences, can elicit negative emotions and affect, contributing to emotional, behavioral, or interpersonal problems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background and objectives: Enteral nutrition (EN) support plays a vital role in reducing malnutrition in hospitalised patients, and its provision is primarily a nurse’s role. Therefore, nurses need to have adequate knowledge and a positive attitude regarding EN. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding enteral nutrition of nursing personnel at 1 Military Hospital and to determine the need for updated in-service training. Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with an analytical component was used to collect data from military nurses through a validated self-administered questionnaire. A score of 80% and above was rated as adequate knowledge. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the results and correlations were used to determine relationships between continuous variables. Results: In total, 207 (86.2% response rate) questionnaires were completed. The median knowledge score was 46.3% (mean 45.8 ± 13.7%, range 6.3–81.2%). Only one participant achieved the target score of ≥ 80%, and 16.3% scored ≥ 60%. No significant differences were found between knowledge and professional rank (p = 0.14) and knowledge and years of working experience (r = −0.01; p = 0.85). A positive attitude towards EN was found and 96.1% of participants expressed the need for additional in-service training. Conclusion: The nursing personnel have inadequate EN knowledge, irrespective of their professional rank and experience. However, they are perceived to have positive attitudes towards the importance and administration of EN. Therefore, in-service training should be conducted regularly to mitigate the gap in knowledge. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to understand students’ ability to search the Internet for COVID-19 information and apply it to evaluate the veracity of specific statements. Participants: Undergraduate students (N = 239) at a US university completed a Web-based questionnaire in September–October 2020. Methods: The questionnaire included self-reported measures of online health information literacy, COVID-19 knowledge, and anxiety along with exercises on searching and evaluating COVID information online. Results: Students reported moderate levels of information literacy (76%, 3.8 out of 5), but did not perform as well while searching the Internet for COVID-19 information (average accuracy: 65%, 10.5 out of 16 points). Students with higher Internet exercise scores reported higher GPA, higher household income, and liberal political views, and were more likely to follow public health measures [ie, social distancing, mask wearing, and not self-medicating with (hydroxy)chloroquine]. Conclusions: University students may overestimate their information literacy while struggling with searching the Internet for accurate COVID-19 information. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of talent management (TM) practices on employee performance (EP) and to explore the mediating role of employee engagement (EE) on the relationship between TM practices and EP in Malaysian private universities (MPUs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper used both descriptive and quantitative approaches, and the unit of analysis of this research consists of MPUs academic staff. The research sample consists of 314 MPUs academic staff, and a questionnaire was used to collect data from the target respondents, while partial least squares-structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the study hypotheses through bootstrapping approach. Findings: The research outcome revealed that TM practices that comprise of talent recruitment practice (TRP), training and development practice (T&DP), compensation practice (CP) have a significant effect on EP. Furthermore, EE partially mediates the relationship between T&DP, CP and EP, while EE does not mediate the relationship between TRP and EP in MPUs. Practical implications: The research suggests that universities management should focus on TM practices as a tool to achieve and maintain EE and positive attitudes (EP) in relation to work. Originality/value: The research makes substantial contributions to the literature by investigating the effect of TM practices on EP through the role of EE as mediation in MPUs. The research is one of the very few studies undertaken in MPUs. Therefore, the results of this research serve as a guide for the universities management to develop their institutional strategies and policies in a manner in which their employees’ success can be achieved and encouraged.International Journal of Business and Society. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The research studied the effectiveness of the integration of Facebook as a flexible ubiquitous learning space into the educational process for speaking skills development of undergraduate students learning English as a second language. For this purpose teaching was organised via a specially created and moderated Facebook group where various media resources, uploaded materials, links to different applications and other social networking opportunities were accumulated. It was designed to achieve the educational programme objectives and address the specifics of digital age learning. A set of specially designed materials posted on the Facebook platform for language input, structured output, and communicative output activities was applied in experimental teaching to develop talk as transition, talk as interaction and mediation, and talk as performance. The results of the quasi-experiment (students’ speaking performance) were assessed in the form of the post-test with the data being analysed and interpreted based on descriptive and inferential statistics (independent samples t-test) by means of SPSS. The results revealed higher achievement scores of the experimental group in comparison to the control group in terms of expanding vocabulary, increasing English grammar literacy, developing interactive skills, discourse management, and pronunciation. The survey administered to find out the learners’ impressions of the successfulness of the FB-assisted activities revealed their overall positive attitude to the new methodology and usefulness for the development of all speaking qualifications checked. © 2022, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions of the Digital Twin (a three-dimensional digital representation of an anatomical body) on a mobile health application, and the potential mechanisms that are important for behaviour change, with a focus on health and weight management. An explorative and participant-led approach was taken using semi-structured online interviews to explore the experiences of people, in this case non-users and users wanting to independently manage their health. An opportunity sample of forty participants from the United Kingdom (20 who had not used digitally assistive technology and 20 who had) were recruited from social media platforms (22 females and 18 males; mean age was 30). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two main themes were elicited: Initiators of behaviour change (i.e., autonomous choices, social influences, and personalisation) and Barriers to behaviour change (i.e., adverse reactions, weight management norms and negative attitudes). Overall, it was suggested that the Digital Twin should be representative of a user’s personalised health information and BMI. These results can inform an intervention designed to use the Digital Twin to initiate and maintain lifestyle behaviour change. It can also develop our understanding of how such technology can be applied as a tool for health management. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to analyze the impact of convenience motivation on behavioral intention of food delivery apps' users with the mediating role of attitude. The research object is three major Food Delivery Apps (FDA) in Indonesia namely GoFood, GrabFood, and ShopeeFood. Primary data was collected through online questionnaire to 195 samples of FDA users. Data was then analyzed with path analysis with three hypothesis. Findings show that user first assess the ease of use in operating FDA above anything else, in which driving in adopting FDA, as well as emerging the intention to purchase food through FDA. However, attitude was found mediate the relationship between convenience motivation and user's behavioral intention. The impact of convenience motivation on behavioral intention of FDA users is mediated by attitude. It means that users' intention to order food through FDA at first emerges because there is a positive attitude, where that attitude is formed when users feel that using FDA is easy. FDA are expected to prioritize ease of use from the application from its design, writing style, symbol, map, and process sequences. Small food enterprises might consider placing their products in existing FDA as consumer prefer to order from the application that familiar with. © 2022 Editura Universitatii din Oradea.

AB  - Background These studies aimed to determine whether a stronger preference for order, structure, and predictability in the urban environment (measured by the Space Intrusion subscale of the Urban Socio-Spatial Disorder Sensitivity Scale) and a higher score on the Out-Group Visual Encroachment scale are associated with more aversive reactions towards the idea of people of another race, ethnicity, or religion settling in the neighborhood. participants and procedure Participants were recruited through online snowball sampling (pilot study) as well as from among university students. Students were also asked to send links to the study to their acquaintances. The pilot study, as well as Study 1B, were conducted online, whereas in Study 1A the paper-pencil method was used. results Scores on the Space Intrusion subscale and the Out-group Visual Encroachment scale were associated with outgroup negativity. Out-group Visual Encroachment was found to mediate the relationship between Space Intrusion and environmental distance toward Muslims. conclusions Perceiving out-groups as out of place is a joint product of environmental features (visual cues of belonging) and characteristics of the individual (sensitivity to urban disorder). The challenge for neighborhoods in times of increased migration is how to shape the public domain to increase the chances of strangers becoming more familiar. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: Concept mapping is used to promote critical thinking and meaningful learning in health professions education. This study aimed to evaluate dental undergraduates' perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for oral radiographic interpretation competency. Methods: A total of 39 third-year undergraduates at a dental college participated in the oral radiological interpretation session. The students received 1 hour of instruction before creating their concept map (CM). Participants were provided an assignment of four relevant clinical cases to draw an individualised CM. The students' draft and final CM were submitted. The instructor evaluated the CMs to identify whether students could analyse, connect and organise the information in a meaningful way. Among them, 37 completed the questionnaire about their experiences and responses to concept mapping. Results: Students perceived concept mapping positively. The instructor's feedback helped them recognise their misconceptions and fostered greater motivation to learn. Students attempted to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and clinical features through cross-linking. However, they also expressed negative attitudes toward concept mapping regarding time consumption and heavy burden. Conclusions: Concept mapping motivated students' directed learning and gave them the opportunity to recognise their misconceptions. This study suggests the potential use of CMs as an adjunctive learning strategy in the oral radiographic interpretation class. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Most countries did not have a consolidated digital health structure before the pandemic. Both social distancing and mental health problems resulting from the situation justify the urgency of discussions on web-mediated interventions. The objective of this work is to present the panorama of technological mediation in mental health services and their specificities in the context of the pandemic. This paper is grounded on a critical look at the migration from face-to-face care to the Internet environment, highlighting: the international experiences using digital technologies in the pandemic context; the challenges in online consultations, emphasizing the importance of the ethical, technical/technological, and clinical domains, which are recurring issues in the international literature; the challenges and perspectives in the use of technologies. It is essential to develop strategies aligned with government incentives, aiming at the quality of the offered services and the guarantee of an adequate hybrid qualification. © 2022.

AB  - Using open-source data, we show that despite significant reductions in global public transit during the COVID-19 pandemic, ∼20% of ridership continues during social distancing measures. Current urban transport data collection methods do not account for the distinct behavioural and psychological experiences of the population. Therefore, little is known about the travel experience of vulnerable citizens that continue to rely on public transit and their concerns over risk, safety and other stressors that could negatively affect their health and well-being. We develop a machine learning approach to augment conventional transport data collection methods by curating a population segmented Twitter dataset representing the travel experiences of ∼120,000 transit riders before and during the pandemic in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Results show a heightened increase in negative sentiments, differentiated by age, gender and ethnicity associated with public transit indicating signs of psychological stress among travellers during the first and second waves of COVID-19. Our results provide empirical evidence of existing inequalities and additional risks faced by citizens using public transit during the pandemic, and can help raise awareness of the differential risks faced by travellers. Our data collection methods can help inform more targeted social-distancing measures, public health announcements, and transit monitoring services during times of transport disruptions and closures. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The perpetual increase in social media data due to social distancing policy in practice and the low cost of communication has acquired an interest in rumor detection in social media. During the togetherness of the globalized world in the pandemic situation of Covid-19, social media applications drive excellent value to the analysts and journalists working in different domains. However, the unmoderated nature of social media users often leads to the spread of rumors due to a variety of opinions on government decisions, which becomes notoriously hard to detect. Also, the users may deny rumors as soon as they are debunked. This research extracts diffused information such as word cloud, hashtags, re-tweets and so forth and uses it as features. These features are applied in the sliding windows of data streams to detect tweets that may be rumors by validating using credible news sources. To address the challenge of veracity, tweets are classified into rumors and nonrumors. A modified unsupervised VADER sentiment classifier is proposed to further classify rumors tweets into amalgamated, unauthoritative, or exaggerated. It is revealed from the results that the proposed classifier is quite efficient in finding and classifying rumorous tweets that arise in critical situations. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - For many years, media and political discourses in Austria have claimed that the Muslim population rarely takes pluralist positions, but instead adopts a negative attitude towards other faiths and people of another religion. The Islamist terror act that took place in Vienna on 2 November 2020 fuelled this stereotype. In order to approach this debate objectively, this article examines Muslims' attitudes towards the religious other in an evidence-based manner. For this purpose, an empirical data set has been reprocessed and reanalysed. The present article reveals the ways in which exclusivist, inclusivist and pluralist attitudes are taken by Muslims; which religious schemes they prefer; and how they interact with non-Muslims in their social environments. In this way, the article sheds light on the diversity of Muslims' positions regarding the religious other and people of another faith; the impact of contextual conditions; and the role of media and its reception. © 2022 Jonas Kolb.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected educational institutions worldwide, resulting in frequent mandatory lockdowns and social distancing rules. After waiting for a brief period, most organizations, including educational institutions, moved their operations from traditional in-class to virtual, web-based teaching-learning. As a result of unprecedented change, faculty, students, and administrators faced several challenges. However, how the educational institutions were coping with this challenging situation remained an important question. To address this, we present Knowledge Management Process (KMP), Knowledge Management System Infrastructure (KMSINF), and Knowledge Management System Quality (KMSQU) as resilient strategies to convert the challenges into opportunities. Using the KM processes and practices, a complex model is constructed to positively influence employee commitment, performance, and job satisfaction. A survey instrument was used to collect data from 747 faculty members from 14 higher educational institutions in the southern part of India. After testing the measurement properties using the Lisrel package of structural equation modeling, the complex model was tested using Hayes PROCESS macros. The results indicate (i) KMP is positively related to performance and employee commitment, (ii) employee commitment mediates the relationship between KMP and performance, (iii) KMSINF moderates the relationship between KMP and employee commitment, (iv) KMSQU moderates the moderated relationship between KMP and KMSINF in influencing the employee commitment, and (v) performance is positively related to job satisfaction. The results suggest that KM processes, system infrastructure, and system quality are effective, resilient strategies to bring educational institutions to normal functioning during the present global pandemic. The implications for KM, employee commitment, and job satisfaction are discussed. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Due to their racialized identity and immigrant status, African immigrants face increased risk for social exclusion and other negative outcomes. Research indicates that discrimination, social and economic disadvantage increase risk for substance use among Black populations in the United States. While emerging studies on African immigrants have explored consequences of social exclusion on psychological health, little is known about how these conditions impact substance use patterns. This study examined the effects of social exclusion on alcohol and/or other drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drugs among African immigrants, and explored whether perceived discrimination mediated this relationship. Data were collected between 2019 and 2020 from a cross-sectional survey examining experiences of first and second-generation African immigrants across the United States (N = 597). The majority of the sample identified as female (71%) and Black (82%). Structural equation modeling was conducted with probit regression paths to examine the direct and indirect effects of three dimensions of social exclusion (sociocultural, economic, and structural) on alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs, with perceived discrimination as the mediator. Increased sociocultural and structural exclusion significantly increased the likelihood of alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs through the perceived discrimination pathway. Structural exclusion also had direct effects on substance use. Findings highlight the importance of examining social stressors when exploring risk for substance use, and point to the need for prevention efforts that reduce negative attitudes and promote inclusivity of this marginalized population. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Media portrayals of sex offenders are often negative, suggesting that public attitudes share a one-dimensional portrait. But past scholarship has regularly relied on a single newspaper or combined national-regional newspapers when investigating the media framing of sex offenders, which has possibly masked the disparate discourse of sex crimes across geographies and outlets. Our qualitative content analysis of sex crime depictions in articles published between 2012–2016 from six daily newspaper outlets of major metropolitan areas demonstrates that the media framing of sex offenders is varied and multidimensional. Our analysis indicates four salient sex offender frames: the monstrous sex offender, the psychotic sex offender, the sex offender versus the victim, and the humanized sex offender. Each frame is constructed by distinctive scripts, or a sequence of events and actions to describe sex offenders and their offenses. As parts of the interpretative repertoire, sex offender frames and scripts are connected to specific policy initiatives from a conservative to a progressive orientation. © 2022 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - Introduction: As of December 1, 2020, when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices published their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and prioritization recommendations, health care workers (HCWs) and the elderly were deemed to be at greatest risk of contracting the coronavirus. Limited extant research suggests that most HCWs are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and findings from studies examining vaccine uptake in non-HCW samples also have reported high vaccination willingness. The health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) suggest that beliefs about severity and susceptibility of disease, perceived benefits of and obstacles to vaccination, and normative beliefs of others affect vaccine uptake. Further, perceptions of safety, side effects, and demographic factors can uniquely impact COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Method: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited 526 participants via social media, through snowball emailing methods, and from university settings. Results: The present findings demonstrate that 37% of participants intend to get the vaccine, and 35% reported that they might get the vaccine. No relationships among demographic factors, willingness to receive the vaccine, and level of intent were observed. However, those who reported that they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated fewer positive attitudes, less agreement, fewer normative views, and less anticipatory regret regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Also, perceptions of susceptibility, severity, and barriers were associated with participants’ willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Discussion: Our results suggest that factors related to the HBM and TPB might uniquely impact COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and could guide the crafting of interventions meant to encourage vaccine uptake. © 2022.

AB  - To counter ongoing NES/NNES, NEST/NNEST dichotomies and the essentializing of NNESs (Ellis, 2016), we examine the personal and professional tensions of an Indigenous Ecuadoran NNES teaching in a dominant Spanish-speaking context. We attend to the ways Roberto (pseudonym) responds to his students and his peers through the lens of his Kichwa identity, the historic oppressed positionality of and ongoing prejudice toward Indigenous peoples in Ecuador. In such contexts, Roberto cannot share “insider” cultural references to enhance his EFL instruction; rather, he is perpetually set as an outsider—both in the broader frame of NNES movement and more singularly and powerfully within his own professional context. We draw upon Esteban-Guitart and Moll's (2014) “funds of identity” and teacher professional identity development (Sachs, 2005) to explore the following central tensions in Roberto's evolving professional teaching identity: (1) Roberto's sense of himself as (il)legitimate speaker of English, (2) role of structural oppression toward Kichwa as it mediates his perceptions and interactions, and (3) the increased use of communicative-based language instruction. Attending to the multiple facets and resources that comprise “funds of identity,” EFL teacher educators can better account for the complex identity formation for EFL teachers and students. © 2022 TESOL International Association.

Beyond the general physical health, financial, and social repercussions of the pandemic, the adopted mitigation measures also present significant challenges in the population's mental health and health programs. It is complex for public organizations to measure the population's mental health in order to incorporate it into their own decision-making process. Traditional survey methods are time-consuming, expensive, and fail to provide the continuous information needed to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of governmental policies on the population's mental health. A significant portion of the population has turned to social media to express the details of their daily life, rendering this public data a rich field for understanding emotional and mental well-being. This study aims to track and measure the sentiment changes of the Mexican population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we analyzed 760,064,879 public domain tweets collected from a public access repository to examine the collective shifts in the general mood about the pandemic evolution, news cycles, and governmental policies using open sentiment analysis tools. Sentiment analysis polarity scores, which oscillate around -0.15, show a weekly seasonality according to Twitter's usage and a consistently negative outlook from the population. It also remarks on the increased controversy after the governmental decision to terminate the lockdown and the celebrated holidays, which encouraged the people to incur social gatherings. These findings expose the adverse emotional effects of the ongoing pandemic while showing an increase in social media usage rates of 2.38 times, which users employ as a coping mechanism to mitigate the feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. The findings have important implications in the mental health infrastructure for ongoing mitigation efforts and feedback on the perception of policies and other measures. The overall trend of the sentiment polarity is 0.0001110643. © 2022 Edgar León-Sandoval et al.

AB  - Covid-19 has changed consumer behaviour, probably forever. Initial consumer stockpiling led to stockouts, threat and uncertainty for consumers. To overcome shortages, consumers expanded their use of channels and many consumers started buying online for the first time. In this paper, we aim to address important research gaps related to consumer behaviour during the pandemic and especially stockpiling. Our paper starts by presenting the findings of our pre-study, which used social media to elicit or confirm potential constructs for our quantitative models. These constructs complemented the protection motivations theory to explain stockpiling behaviour, forming the basis for study 1, the stockpiling preparation stage and study 2, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic disruptor on customer service logistics and lockdown shopping channel preferences. For studies 1 and 2 we gathered data via a UK online panel-structured questionnaire survey (n = 603). Results confirm that consumer-driven changes to supply chains emanate largely from consumer uncertainty. Lockdown restrictions led to consumers feeling socially excluded, but enhanced consumers’ positive attitudes towards shopping online and increased consumers’ altruism. In response, consumers stockpiled by visiting physical stores and/or ordering online. Lockdown restrictions led to feelings of social exclusion but, importantly, stockpiling helped to minimize consumer anxiety and fear and even increase wellbeing. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: In order to halt the progression of COVID-19, governments of many countries including India implemented national lockdown. In view of the sudden closure of educational institutions, remote teaching was implemented with the help of online learning or E-learning. Thus, the aim of the study was assessing the attitudes and perceptions of MBBS students regarding the effectiveness of e-learning and the impact of COVID-19 on the student’s mental wellbeing and learning. Methods: The survey instrument was a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 17 close ended questions and 3 open ended question. It has 3 sociodemographic questions, 13 questions assessing their attitudes and perceptions regarding the effectiveness of e-learning and 4 questions investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the student’s mental wellbeing and learning. The data obtained was analyzed using SPSS (version 20). Results: A total of 404 undergraduate students studying in FMHS, SGT University, Gurugram participated in the survey. A major part of the students (57.1%) was using their Mobile phones for e-learning followed by 24.6% using their Personal computer or Laptop, 12% were using combination of these devices and 6.3% using tablets. Due to inconsistent internet connection, most of the students (71.5%) were facing challenges. 64.9% of the respondents faced distraction during the class such as lack of audio clarity, internet connection problems, lack of environment, concentration issues, notifications and social media, student teacher interactions, practical aspect not covered and lack of physical interaction with the teacher. The continuous screen time posed a major problem for students who suffered from strain in the eyes (58.3%), headache (18.7%), neck pain (8.8%), back pain (6.3%) or all of the above problems (7.7%). Thus, 84.1% of the undergraduate students preferred conventional Classroom learning to e-learning. Conclusions: Implementation of strict social distancing and lockdown in COVID-19 era, has mandated the pedagogy of remote learning which remains the only viable option for teaching and learning in these difficult times. The students should be advised to follow good ergonomic practices to maintain their ocular health and should be motivated to enhance their mental well-being and learning amid COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 International Medical Sciences Academy.

AB  - For older adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic and UK restrictions arrived during a critical period in the transition to adulthood. Early research exploring impact of the pandemic paints a picture of worsened adolescent wellbeing and mental health. We explore the subjective experiences of 16- to 19-year-olds during the first UK lockdown, with an emphasis on wellbeing and coping, to complement quantitative evidence and inform strategies and provision for support. In May 2020, we invited UK-based 16- to 19-year-olds to share written accounts of their experiences of the initial UK lockdown for The TELL Study. A total of 109 participants engaged, submitting anonymous written accounts via an online survey portal. We used inductive reflexive thematic analysis to develop rich experiential themes. We constructed seven main themes: heightened emotionality; feelings of loss, change, and uncertainty; recognizing the value of self-care; efforts to think positively; opportunities for relief, growth, and development; the importance of togetherness; and frustration with government and media. Findings highlight the multifaceted nature of adolescents’ lockdown experiences, and offer insight into emotional impact and new concerns alongside the value placed on self-care and staying connected. We offer directions for supporting adolescents as pandemic consequences continue. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Journalists can play a pivotal role in promoting a population’s security amid a health crisis such as a global pandemic. This role becomes of enhanced importance for marginalized populations as they face a compounded threat due to preexisting social inequalities and exclusion. This study focuses on the utilization of Twitter by ultra-Orthodox journalists during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel. The study applies a thematic analysis of 23,110 tweets from the 20 most popular ultra-Orthodox journalists on Twitter. Findings reveal that ultra-Orthodox journalists utilized Twitter in an “ambassadorial” role to advocate their community’s security through six strategies: (1) explaining the challenges endangering ultra-Orthodox Jews during COVID-19, (2) dispelling COVID-19 accusations directed against ultra-Orthodox Jews, (3) encouraging social distancing and health guidelines, (4) highlighting the social contributions of ultra-Orthodox Jews to the general public during the pandemic, (5) criticizing wrongdoers who violated the health guidelines, and (6) calling out acts of hatred and bigotry that have been directed toward ultra-Orthodox Jews. These findings reveal the professional ethos of ultra-Orthodox journalists and their aspiration to protect their community. Furthermore, these findings shed light on the vital role Twitter can play in journalistic work through inter-social interactivity and the enablement of capabilities, particularly the capability “to be secure.” Lastly, this study expands the understanding of the social media resource contributing to policymakers tasked with formulating its fair distribution in society in accordance with the capabilities approach and its objective of promoting well-being. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper discusses the results of a research1 that integrates Digital Interactive Storytelling (DIST), competenceoriented mathematical activities, and argumentation called DIST-M. The general aim is to support a reflective knowledge of mathematical concepts by implementing a digital educational device based on collaborative and dialogical activities proposed by researchers. Within a dialogical dimension of interactions (Bakhtin, 1981), argumentative practice is considered a social activity, where the acquisition and elaboration of new knowledge take place within a social space with multiple interlocutors in a dynamic process. The participants are engaged in constructing and negotiating mathematical meanings within a specific context. This dialogical approach to argumentation tends to create an authentic argumentative culture that is a system of implicit and explicit rules where the exchanges and interactions among participants require a joint elaboration of new meanings, within a given mathematical context, through a dialogical exchange. Learning and development result from a dialogical negotiation process during which new knowledge is developed and those already possessed are re-organized and systematized (Bakhtin, 1981; Vygotskij, 1978). In the current pandemic circumstances, technologies are the main tools to uphold the educational processes. Despite the fact that the DIST-M was implemented and tested before the Covid-19 era, its epistemic bases of dialogism mediated by technology could significantly keep alive the dialogic interaction in educational settings that have been heavily affected by the social distancing and promote mathematical thinking. The articles focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal n. 4," Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. © 2022 University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

AB  - Emerging evidence suggests medical and social models of disability, or sets of assumptions regarding the cause and treatment of disability, and contact with people with disabilities, influence attitudes about people with disabilities. This study tests disability models and contact as an avenue for disability attitude intervention. Three psychology undergraduate classes were examined. Education + contact focused on social construction of disability, challenged the medical model, and was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 52). Contact did not include disability content but was taught by an instructor with a disability (n = 45). Control did not include disability content and was taught by an instructor without a disability (n = 53). Participants completed measures of disability models and attitudes at the beginning and end of each 10-week course. Results showed medical model beliefs were associated with negative attitudes while social model beliefs were associated with positive attitudes. Participants in the education + contact group reported greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs, and greater reductions in medical model beliefs at posttest than participants in the contact or control groups. The contact group also showed greater increases in positive attitudes and social model beliefs and greater reductions in medical model beliefs compared to the control group. Change in medical model beliefs mediated the relationship between course and attitude change. This is the first study to demonstrate that disability models can be intervened upon and can explain disability attitude change. Such interventions may prepare psychology students to interact with this large minority group. © 2020. American Psychological Association

AB  - Objectives: Using the Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework, we investigated the association between attitudes towards COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy and change in these variables over a 9-month period in a UK cohort. Methods: The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results: Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions: Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - The containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, including social distancing, lockdown or quarantining, have led to a paradigm shift in people's life. In the wake of the pandemic, many people have begun adopting technology as a way to maintain their daily activities and limit face-to-face human interactions. While the pandemic has facilitated the widespread use of technology, little attention has been paid to how consumers' intention to continue using technology is affected by their rational evaluation and habitual response, simultaneously. To address this knowledge gap, this study employs the expectation-confirmation model as a theoretical lens to propose the research model and explain the antecedents of technology continuance intention from both perspectives of conscious versus unconscious responses. The conscious response is reflected in perceived value and satisfaction, whereas the unconscious response is characterized as habit. The proposed research model and hypotheses are supported by the data collected from 308 online food delivery service users. Our results show that habit is driven by perceived value and satisfaction, and then mediates the effects of them on continuance intention. Moreover, habit exerts the strongest effect on continuance intention and weakens the importance of perceived value as well as satisfaction to continuance intention. This study is expected to set the theoretical foundation for more future research that focus on the exploration of the conscious versus unconscious nature of consumers' technology continuance. The study concludes with practical implications and suggestions for catering businesses and relevant stakeholders. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To assess the depression, anxiety and stress levels among the adult population in response to COVID 19. Methodology: This online study was conducted between the months of March to June 2020. A DASS-21 questionnaire was utilized in order to screen out the depression, stress and anxiety patients. Results: Out of 248 participants, 157 (63.30%) showed depression, 184 (74.19%) showed anxiety and 148 (59.67) showed stress. The individuals were showing significantly (p < 0.05) more stress who felt they could be infected or those who read COVID-19 related post regularly. Individuals who were worried about, to have infection in their family/friends or suffering financial burden were more in stress, anxiety or depression. Conclusion: There was high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress during COVID-19 pandemic because of changes in life style. © 2022, Pakistan Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Members of a minority population are expected to evaluate political authorities through a different spectrum than majority members. Still, only a few studies have explored the role of local conditions as determinants for political attitudes among a linguistic minority population. This study focuses on the role of linguistic homogeneity, local economic conditions and community size as determinants for corruption perceptions and political trust at the individual level among members of a linguistic minority population: the Swedish-speaking Finns. Moreover, this study differs empirically between evaluations of the local and national authorities. Combining data from a panel survey collected by Barometern (2019–21) with varying contextual-level factors in a multilevel model, we show that evaluations of local authorities are related to local contextual factors, in particular municipal unemployment rates and median incomes, while national evaluations are largely unrelated to local conditions. In contrast to theoretical expectations for an in-group bias among minority members, however, we find no effect for linguistic homogeneity on corruption perceptions and political trust after controlling for economic conditions. The results make an important contribution to our understanding about the role of local conditions for political attitudes among a well-assimilated minority population. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Mental illness (MI) stigma has been characterized as multi-dimensional including problems of knowledge (stereotypes), attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination); however, most research practice is predominantly applying unidimensional behavioral measures such as social distance scales. Moreover, specific types of MIs and different forms of discriminatory behaviors are not being differentiated. The Stereotype Content Model predicts that group stereotypes (warmth, competence) are linked with different forms of discriminatory behaviors (harm or facilitation) via emotional prejudices (pity, envy, contempt). The present study sought to establish how differential stereotypic perceptions of MI subgroups elicit distinct forms of behavioral discrimination via emotional prejudices. A community sample (N = 60) was randomly assigned to one of three conditions representing MIs across the warmth-competence stereotype space. Patterns of self-completed measures for stereotypes, emotions and behaviors differed significantly between conditions. The association between stereotypes and behaviors were largely mediated by emotions. Systematic patterns of stereotypic perceptions, emotional prejudices and behavioral discrimination are present for individuals with different types of MIs. Hence, generic measures of discrimination, such as social distance scales, may be misleading. Intervention strategies should consider the systematic variation of the factors involved in stigma, differentiating by type of MI and discriminatory behaviors. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Bounded Generalized Reciprocity (BGR) hypothesizes that expectations of reciprocity provide the foundation for ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. These expectations can be influenced by interaction with outgroup members, including vicarious interaction through media. This analysis examines how non-Black participants view helping behavior by Black individuals, and how their interpretations of helping scenarios influence intergroup attitudes. Participants (n= 211) were randomly assigned to view a news clip in which a Black or White hero saves someone White, or whose race was not portrayed. When viewing a clip with an ambiguous victim, participants were significantly more likely to report that the victim was not White when the hero was Black–indicating an expectation of helping behavior between Whites and Blacks. However, when a Black hero saved an unambiguously White victim, participants were more accurate in their recall. Victim race recall and hero race interacted to predict future reciprocity expectations, such that Black heroes saving a victim recalled as White (regardless of accuracy) resulted in increased positive reciprocity expectations. Positive reciprocity then predicted motivation to avoid prejudice and prejudiced attitudes. These results have implications for how media depictions of helping behaviors may impact intergroup beliefs and attitudes. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of smartphone addiction in young adults, and to investigate the relationship between smartphone use, depression, anxiety, and social appearance anxiety. Materials and Methods: Sociodemographic data form, Smartphone Dependence Scale-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care-Short Form, Beck Anxiety Scale, and Social Appearance Anxiety Scale were applied face to face in this cross-descriptive study. Results: A total of 259 subjects, 128 (49.4%) female and 131 (50.6%) male, were included in the study. 25.9% of the participants were smartphone addicts. There was a high positive correlation between smartphone usage time and smartphone addiction score. The social appearance anxiety average scores of the social media users (30.8±13.9) were higher than those of subjects who do not use social media (28.8±11.3). Smartphone addiction scale had a positive correlation with anxiety and social appearance anxiety scores, while not with depression. Conclusion: Our results revealed that the purpose of smartphone usage affects people more than smartphone usage or smartphone addiction. The internet, and especially programs related to sharing one’s appearance and lifestyle and applications that create an unrealistic appearance that conforms to virtual norms, can add hard-to-repair prejudices to the mind. This situation should be seen as a threat, especially for the younger generation, and is a new sociological problem worth investigating. © 2022 Istanbul University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) from low income diverse communities are experiencing the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic most acutely. Method: To better understand the impacts of the pandemic on the wellbeing of adults with IDD from an urban US region and how they are managing the associated disruptions, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 participants. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze data. Results: Participants experienced stress in response to pandemic media reports and attempted to cope by sanitizing and wearing masks. These did little to reduce stress and may have added to frustration with non-compliers. Social distancing limited access to family, leading to isolation. Participants who engaged in spiritual practices, physical fitness and creative activities were more successful in coping. Conclusions: People with IDD may benefit from mindfulness practices or developing creative hobbies to be better equipped to cope. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions for visitors and caregivers in healthcare settings and long-term care (LTC) facilities were enacted in the larger context of public health policies that included physical distancing and shelter-in-place orders. Older persons residing in LTC facilities constituted over half of the mortality statistics across Canada during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the poststructuralist work of Agamben, Foucault and Mbembe we conducted a thematic analysis on news reports. The extracts of media stories presented in our paper suggest that the scholarship on (bio)power and necropolitics is central for understanding the ways the COVID-19 crisis reveals the pragmatic priorities - and the € health' and political values - that undergird the moral imagination of the public, including the educated classes of advanced Western democracies. Our critical analysis shows that by isolating individuals who were sick, fragile, and biologically and socially vulnerable, undifferentiated population management policies like social distancing, when piled on the structural weakness of health systems, reproduced inequities and risk for those in need of medical care, advocacy, and social companionship in acute moments of illness, death and grief. Considering the unprecedented deployment of governmental power via public health interventions based on social regulation to protect the population during the crisis - how can we understand so much death and suffering among the most vulnerable? © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

AB  - The objective of this study was to survey pregnant and lactating toward COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan and determine the predictors of this attitude This study used a 10 min anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey to collect data. The survey was carried out between September and October 2021. Eligible study participants included all pregnant and lactating women in Jordan. The participants were recruited through social media, midwives, and gynecologists. Survey was used to collect data from the participants. The mean attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID vaccination was moderate 71 (SD=100.5). Many factors were predicted the attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination. The factors were source of data regarding COVID-19 (B=-0.140, p=0.009), level of income (B=-0.141, p=0.009), and social status (B=0.130, p=0.034). These results mean lower income, people who frequently hearing news from news channel or ministry of health and married are showed more positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination for children. This is a large national study regarding attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. This study found that more than 50% for the parents were hesitant to allow their children to receive COVID-19 vaccination. There were no differences between pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination. © 2022

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by a persistent propensity to generate recurring epileptic seizures. Young adults such as university students can bridge the gap and improve attitudes toward patients with epilepsy and reduce stigma. This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of university students in the city of Makkah about epilepsy. Methods: This cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out at main universities in the Makkah region of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted after getting approval from Umm Al-Qura University’s ethics and research committee. A total of 394 participants were enrolled in the study, and a stratified random sampling (probability sampling) technique was used to select respondents. Results: The study included students with a mean age of 20.9 ± 4.6 (18–28 years), 271 (68.8%) students were females, 374 (94.9%) of the students agreed that epilepsy is not contagious, and 215 (54.6%) refused the impact of epilepsy on patients’ marital status, relationships and fertility, respectively, 213 (54.1%) of the students reported that they feel scared to witness a seizure. About 334 (84.8%) respondents believed that epilepsy is an affliction, and 123 (31.2%) reported that they thought epilepsy was a supernatural phenomenon or black magic. Conclusion: The study concluded a satisfactory level of awareness among university students in Makkah related to dealing with patients with epilepsy. Further scientific studies will help build student’s positive attitudes through simulation programs and interventional studies. © 2022 Alkhotani and Alkhotani.

AB  - Introduction: Substantial distribution of information, education, and communication related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the most cost-effective means to deliver desirable behavioral changes to stop/diminish the spread of the disease. Material and methods: In the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula. Collected data was processed with SPSS version 22.0 statistical software, and descriptive method of data analysis was used. A total of 363 participants were included from March to June 2020, using stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique. Results: The findings revealed that, major source of information used by university students on HIV/AIDS was radio (52.3%), followed by television (47.1%). From the study subjects, 60.3%, 39.4%, and 31.9% of them labeled currently available information sources as group specific, fear arousing, and boring, respectively. Students from College of Medicine and Health Sciences showed a better understanding of the virus. Moreover, a small number of the study subjects, i.e., 66 (18.2%), had a negative attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Conclusions: Most participants had fair knowledge about definition, transmission, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. However, knowledge by itself could not guarantee a change in behavior, as students were involved in different risky activities. In nearly all the cases, academic years of the participants and their field of study had an influence on the magnitude of behavioral changes delivered. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - Background: Managing high levels of acute COVID-19 bed occupancy can affect the quality of care provided to both affected patients and those requiring other hospital services. Mass vaccination has offered a route to reduce societal restrictions while protecting hospitals from being overwhelmed. Yet, early in the mass vaccination effort, the possible impact on future bed pressures remained subject to considerable uncertainty. Objective: The aim of this study was to model the effect of vaccination on projections of acute and intensive care bed demand within a 1 million resident healthcare system located in South West England. Methods: An age-structured epidemiological model of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered type was fitted to local data up to the time of the study, in early March 2021. Model parameters and vaccination scenarios were calibrated through a system-wide multidisciplinary working group, comprising public health intelligence specialists, healthcare planners, epidemiologists and academics. Scenarios assumed incremental relaxations to societal restrictions according to the envisaged UK Government timeline, with all restrictions to be removed by 21 June 2021. Results: Achieving 95% vaccine uptake in adults by 31 July 2021 would not avert the third wave in autumn 2021 but would produce a median peak bed requirement ∼6% (IQR: 1-24%) of that experienced during the second wave (January 2021). A 2-month delay in vaccine rollout would lead to significantly higher peak bed occupancy, at 66% (11-146%) of that of the second wave. If only 75% uptake was achieved (the amount typically associated with vaccination campaigns), then the second wave peak for acute and intensive care beds would be exceeded by 4% and 19%, respectively, an amount which would seriously pressure hospital capacity. Conclusion: Modelling influenced decision-making among senior managers in setting COVID-19 bed capacity levels, as well as highlighting the importance of public health in promoting high vaccine uptake among the population. Forecast accuracy has since been supported by actual data collected following the analysis, with observed peak bed occupancy falling comfortably within the inter-quartile range of modelled projections. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Hate crime legislation is a divisive issue in America. While many Americans agree that hate crime laws are necessary, roughly one-third of Americans do not support such legislation. Some research suggests that one reason for this variation in support may be differences in political attitudes. Other research suggests that variation in support may be attributable to differences in prejudicial attitudes toward those minority groups that hate crime laws are intended to protect. Importantly, however, prior research has also indicated a relationship between political affiliation and prejudice, yet research has not considered the potential for there to be a joint relationship between prejudice, political affiliation, and hate crime law support. Following this, the current research examined these relationships using data from 1,935 survey respondents across the United States who voted in the 2016 election, shared who they voted for, and expressed opinions regarding hate crime laws. Our results indicated at least three important findings. First, we found that political attitudes were uniquely associated with hate crime law support, such that more conservative voters were less likely to support hate crime laws. Second, indicators of anti-Hispanic, anti-Asian, and anti-Black prejudice were each negatively associated with hate crime law support. Finally, each of these prejudicial attitude measures significantly mediated the association between political affiliation and hate crime law support. These results suggest that politically conservative resistance to these laws may be partially rooted in prejudicial attitudes. By understanding these patterns, this research can inform important policy debates surrounding these issues moving forward. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Many of the individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, attack on theU.S. Capitol did not have ties to far-right extremist groups, leading some pundits and researchers to speculate that extremism has become mainstream and much more common in the current political environment. In this article, we discuss events before and during January 6 that affected extremism and pushed people toward polarization. Specifically, we discuss the role of the media, especially social media, in developing like-minded content sharing and polarizing, extremist group norms. The role of groups to drive people toward protest is discussed within research on social movements. The role of identity and acceptability of prejudice toward outgroup political members and how this identity fed into increasing extremist rhetoric are also discussed. Then, we discuss conditions of the day of January 6, including establishment of norms through rhetoric and the social proof of extremist action, and also, the easy exit of those who could leave an increasingly escalating situation. Finally, we address the implications for the current political climate, including the potential for increased violence and extremism © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Felt understanding is linked to intergroup relations. However, almost all of the studies linking felt understanding to intergroup relations have been conducted in a relation where ingroups and outgroups cohabit within a community having a shared superordinate political structure/system (cohabitating target). It is unclear whether this association generaliddzes to another relation that ingroups and outgroups live in separate communities with different superordinate systems (separate target). The present work investigates whether the predictive role of felt understanding in intergroup relations differs across the two targets—Chinese people in Japan (CIJ) and Chinese people outside of Japan (COJ). Data were collected in Japan by two online surveys among 536 Japanese (189 females) in 2021. Multigroup analysis found that felt understanding was linked to positive intergroup outcomes (positive action tendencies, outgroup trust, intergroup orientation) for both cohabiting and separate target conditions. Also, post hoc mediation analysis suggested that the cohabiting/ separate target condition was positively related to felt understanding, and higher felt understanding, in turn, results in the outcomes. These results indicate that felt understanding can be beneficial even in intergroup relations not involving a shared superordinate system and that the level (not the effect) of felt understanding may be influenced by cohabiting/separate targets. Implications for consolidating peace in Japan–China relations are discussed, which may be relevant to other international relations. © 2022. American Psychological Association

AB  - The EU and China are both pioneers in energy transition and are major energy consumers. However, we know little about the attitude of the Chinese public toward EU's energy role or EU–China energy cooperation. The paper contributes to the study of relationship between agenda-setting and public opinion in the context of Chinese social media. Using empirical data, it finds that energy cooperation, energy trading, energy politics, and energy technology&service are the four co-occurrence networks of Chinese public discussion on the topic. Yet the opinion leaders differ on these issues. While verified media accounts are key opinion leaders setting the agenda in EU energy politics and trade issues, in energy technology and service issues, verified individual accounts lead opinions. The study helps understand the role of online opinion leaders in EU–China energy relations and argues that key opinion leaders need to play more active roles in communicating the issues and guiding public discussions. © 2022 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Health professional education curricula in Nepal do not include interprofessional education (IPE). Though a previous study conducted in Nepal identified positive attitudes among medical and nursing students, so far there are no studies assessing the health professional students’ readiness toward IPE. The aim of the study was to assess the readiness for IPE among medical and dental students. Methods: The present cross-sectional study explored the readiness of conveniently selected first-year medical and dental students towards IPE and compared readiness among subgroups of respondents. The readiness was assessed through an online survey using the standard Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) during June 2021. The nineteen questions in RIPLS were categorized under four domains: teamwork and collaboration (items 1–9), negative professional identity (items 10–12), positive professional identity (items 13–16), and roles and responsibilities (items 17–19). The individual statements were scored and assessed as per the study objectives. The scores were not normally distributed, so non-parametric tests (Mann–Whitney U-test and Kruskal Wallis test) were used. Results: A total of 83 students (69 medical and 14 dental) students responded. The median total score was 75, IQR 6 with the maximum score being 95. The median (IQR) scores for the domains teamwork and collaboration were 38 (IQR 3), negative professional identity 11 (IQR 2), positive professional identity 16 (IQR 3), roles and responsibilities 10 (3). The scores were different between students aged 20 years and below = 37, and above 20 years = 38; (p =< 0.001) in the negative professional identity domain and the total score (p = 0.001). The scores were also different among those with and without previous learning exposure with other discipline students in the same class (p = 0.046). A high median score of 5 was achieved for 8 out of 19 statements in the questionnaire. Conclusion: The findings showed a high level of readiness for IPE among student respondents. Study findings can be considered as a positive factor for implementing IPE sessions. © 2022 Jha et al.

AB  - As the people around the globe suffered physically, relationally, emotionally, and financially in response to the COVID-19 crisis and accompanying social distancing mandates, they often turned to social media to cope. This study used an online survey to understand the relationships between social media engagement, loneliness, well-being, perceived social support, and social comparison with an Indian sample (N = 364). Correlations showed significant associations between all variables of interest, with the exception of social media engagement and perceived social support. Partial correlations revealed that an association between social media engagement and loneliness disappeared when social comparison orientation was controlled for; however, an inverse relationship between social media engagement and well-being remained, even when social comparison orientation was accounted for. © 2022.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused major societal changes worldwide, with the most notable being lockdowns and restrictions on social contact. We conducted a longitudinal study (total n = 1907) in Germany with two time points to (1) identify demographic risk factors of impaired social contact during the pandemic, as well as investigate potential consequences of (2) impaired social contact and (3) different modes of communication on individuals' well-being during the first lockdown in spring 2020. Results indicate that particularly individuals living alone and being unable to work reported a lower frequency of (face-to-face) contact in comparison with participants living with others or working. Impaired social contact was indirectly associated with a negative development in well-being (life satisfaction, anxiety and depression) over time, and this relation was mediated via relatedness. Moreover, the frequency of face-to-face and phone communication during lockdown was positively associated with relatedness and well-being; however, digital communication was not. The findings stress the importance of maintaining social contact in times of social distancing and of fostering reconnection between individuals once the pandemic is over. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study examines meaning-making in and through coronavirus memes, as part of broader representations of the pandemic circulating online. It also aims to make a broader conceptual contribution by advancing a theory of mimetic representation that considers memes to be cultural meaning units and, building on social representations theory, proposes objectification, anchoring, and identification as their 3 main constitutive processes. A content analysis that focuses on these processes was conducted on a systematically generated sample of 1,544 memes posted on Reddit’s r/CoronavirusMemes between January and May 2020. We found that the pandemic is objectified most often in terms of protective measures (e.g., quarantine, social distancing) and transmission (e.g., coughing, traveling when sick); that it is anchored in popular media themes, followed by geography, politics, and history; and that, in terms of identification, most memes portrayed the self and/or in-group. Although, over time, memes displayed more objectification and less identification, the ones that did make reference to in and out-groups were more commented on. These results suggest that analyses guided by the theory of mimetic representation can shed light on the dynamic nature of meaning-making processes on social media and the importance of memes in terms of framing wider societal debates as well as creating new identities, online and offline. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Purpose: The uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 has forced employees to use telework technologies and platforms to perform different tasks, that is, “mandatory telework”. COVID-19 is a unique situation that has shocked economies and societies and led to a reshaping of the perception of employees and firms about work practices. However, due to the recent nature of the phenomenon, it is not usually understood how employees would cope with this forced change. Thus, the study aims to explore COVID-19 awareness and employees’ behavior toward mandatory telework. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 201 Danish employees was selected to examine the research questions using partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that COVID-19 awareness reduces technological anxiety and increases positive attitudes and job satisfaction. The authors have also found the full and partially mediating role of attitude and technological anxiety on the relationship between COVID-19 awareness and job satisfaction. Originality/value: The study employed the theoretical lens of job demands-resources theory to understand COVID-19 awareness and technological anxiety dynamics on employees’ attitudes toward mandatory telework and job satisfaction during the pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Perceived variability is a relatively unexplored prejudice reduction approach. We developed a new intervention and tested it in two pre-registered experiments—in field and online laboratory settings. Across both experiments, we found that the intervention did not reduce prejudice. As expected, higher perceived variability correlated with lower prejudice. However, the correlations were weak and markedly lower in the higher-powered online laboratory trial. Overall, these results indicate that perceived variability may have limited scaling potential due to low adaptability and effectiveness. Exploratory analyses indicated that effects of the intervention did not substantially differ across age, gender, and education. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Current policies to manage ethnic minority unrest in Xinjiang are not working, and do not address the core root causes behind ethnic tensions. Drawing upon lessons learned from global approaches to improving inter-ethnic relations, and factoring in China’s institutional behaviour and norms, this essay looks at policy responses that could be entertained by the state to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It suggests that in the short-term (under a year) the state could be more responsible in using the big data it collects for targeted surveillance, in tandem with a community engagement approach. In the medium-term (one to three years), the state could employ practices to reduce ethnic prejudice by encouraging increased meaningful intergroup contact, and promoting a positive media portrayal of ethnic minorities. In the long-term (three years plus), improving the relative socioeconomic ethnic inequalities is paramount. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Guided by the theory of planned behavior and the science communication learning goals model, we conducted a survey to identify science communication training needs of university scientists (n = 266) at a large US land-grant university. Results indicate that most respondents believed scientists and media relations offices were most responsible for communicating science to the public but only somewhat responsible for their learning of science communication or its outcomes. In addition, respondents who had higher levels of interest and enjoyment in science communication perceived their content knowledge to be higher and reflected on science communication concepts and processes better than respondents with lower levels of interest and enjoyment. We also found that scientists who participated in science communication training during the past three years enjoyed science communication more and were more likely to contribute than scientists who did not participate. Results suggest that communication training should focus on increasing scientists’ positive attitudes toward public engagement and motivating scientists to feel responsible for public engagement. Trainers should encourage scientists to share their communication experiences with colleagues, expose them to science communication resources, and help them recognize their individual role in the science communication process. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Dutch general election of March 2021 can be referred to as the ‘Corona’ election, as the world-wide pandemic influenced all aspects of this election. The government made special provisions to make participation safer for voters. Restrictions on crowd size and social distancing restricted the possibilities for traditional means of election campaigning. Thus the campaign was carried out primarily in the mass and social media. The Corona virus and health care were prominent issues during the campaign. However, Corona had little influence on turnout as the percentage was only slightly lower than for the previous election. Corona seems to have produced ‘rally around the leader’ or ‘don’t change horses’ effects among Dutch voters. The Liberal Party (VVD) gained one seat, D66 five, and the CU held onto its seats. Although the CDA lost four seats, this was the first election since 1981 that a coalition had not lost seats at a subsequent election. The total number of parties represented rose to a record 17 (for 150 seats in the Second Chamber or Dutch lower house). Corona also impacted the coalition formation process when an infected ‘explorer’ was photographed with notes from the negotiations when she hurriedly left the building. The ensuing debate created distrust among potential partners that took several months to resolve. In the end, after the longest formation process in Dutch history, the coalition consisted of the same parties as in the previous Cabinet and was led by the same Prime Minister, Mark Rutte. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The study explores the moderating role of interpersonal influence in the relationship between overqualification and social distance, in the context of hotels and travel agents in Egypt. Drawing on the social influence theory, the study develops an integrative model examining the links between overqualification, social distance and four distinct organizational attitudes (i.e., intention to quit, job satisfaction, well-being and counterproductive). Using data collected from 409 hotels and travel agents, we show that interpersonal influence plays an important role in reducing the negative influence of overqualification on social acceptance. We also reveal that overqualification has an influence on employees’ intention to quit, job satisfaction, well-being, and counterproductive behaviour through the mediating role of social acceptance. Finally, social acceptance is determined to be a predictor of organizational attitude. A call to investigate proximal behavioral results, such as feedback-seeking and knowledge sharing so that the approaches incorporated with organizational attitude can be more explicitly understood. Moreover, it would be advantageous to distinguish between different types of overqualification. The current research suggests ways to diminish the likely unfavorable consequences of overqualification, through the impact of interpersonal influence and social acceptance, in order to maximize and best utilize the potential of overqualified employees. © 2022 AJHTL /Author(s)

AB  - Social distancing behaviour is a primary preventive measure for reducing COVID-19 transmission. Improved understanding of factors associated with adherence to social distancing is vital for mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in South Africa. The study assessed adherence to social distancing and its associated factors during the state-implemented lockdown in South Africa. Data was analysed from a large-scale public survey conducted in South Africa from 8 to 29 April 2020, which was administered online and telephonically. Invitations to participate were distributed widely on local websites and social media networks, including on a data-free platform. Adherence to social distancing was measured by self-report of having engaged in close physical contact with someone outside the home. Simple and multiple logistic regression models examined the association between social distancing and potential explanatory variables. Of the 17,586 participants, 9.2% came into close physical contact with a person outside their home by hugging, kissing, or shaking hands during the past 7 days. The odds of coming into close physical contact with other people were significantly higher for males, students, and those with incorrect knowledge on physical distancing, angry attitudes about the lockdown, lack of confidence in the government response, high-risk perception, movement out of the local area, travelling to shops using public transport, households with communal water facilities and higher household size. The 25–59-year olds compared to 18–24-year olds, and the White and Indian/Asian compared to the African population groups had significantly lower odds of close physical contact with others outside the home. The study identifies subgroups of individuals for whom public health interventions to improve adherence to social distancing should be prioritised and tailored. Interventions and policies should take cognisance of the social determinants of health as well as culturally accepted greeting practices like hand shaking. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study tests a novel explanation for geographic divides in populist and anti-immigration attitudes. This explanation centres around place resentment: the feeling that one’s area is ignored by policy makers and that members of one’s local community are misunderstood and disrespected by inhabitants of other areas. I argue that place resentment mediates the relationship between the type of area one inhabits and political attitudes. With representative survey data and contextual data from The Netherlands, I show that place resentment is an important mediator explaining how geographic divides translate into anti-immigration and populist attitudes. Place resentment is a stronger explanation for geographic variation in political attitudes than alternative explanations I explored. The results suggest that place resentment plays a central role in explaining geographic polarization in Western democracies. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease of 2019) is caused by SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and it was first diagnosed in December 2019 in China. As of 25th Aug 2021, there are 165 million confirmed COVID-19 positive cases and 4.4 million deaths globally. As of today, though there are approved COVID-19 vaccine candidates only 4 billion doses have been administered. Until 100% of the population is safe, no one is safe. Even though these vaccines can provide protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease, it does not provide 100% protection from getting infected and passing it on to others. The more the virus spreads; it has more opportunity to mutate. So, it is mandatory to follow all precautions like maintaining social distance, wearing mask, washing hands frequently irrespective of whether a person is vaccinated or not. To prevent spread of the virus, contact tracing based on social distance also becomes equally important. The work proposes a solution that can help with contact tracing/identification, knowing the infected persons recent travel history (even within the city) for few days before being assessed positive. While the person would be able to give the known contacts with whom he/she has interacted with, he/she will not be aware of who all were in proximity if he/she had been in public places. The proposed solution is to get the CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) video clips from those public places for the specific date and time and identify the people who were in proximity-i.e., not followed the safe distance to the infected person. The approach uses YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once) which uses darknet framework for people detection. Once the infected person is located from the video frames, the distance from that person to the other people in the frame is found, to check if there is a violation of social distance guideline. If there is, then the people violating the distance are extracted and identified using Facial detection and recognition algorithms. Two different solutions for Face detection and Recognition are implemented and results compared-Dlib based models and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) based models. The solutions were studied for two different CCTV footages and the results for Dlib based models were better than OpenCV based models for the studied videos. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

AB  - This study employed an extended theory of planned behaviour to assess the socio-psychological factors influencing farmers’ willingness to continue participating (WTCP) in collaborative activities of community-based innovation platforms (CB-IPs). Using a structured questionnaire, data were obtained from a random sample of 231 farmers who had participated in collaborative activities of the CB-IPs. Data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. Findings showed that although farmers’ past-experience did not directly influence their WTCP in collaborative activities of CB-IPs, it was positive and significant when mediated by attitudes and perceived behavioural control (t-value = 6.840; p-value = 0.000). Therefore, it can be concluded that farmers’ WTCP in collaborative activities of CB-IPs is enhanced by three socio-psychological factors: favourable past-experience, positive attitudes towards collaborative activities of CB-IPs, and farmers’ perceived capacity to participate. Hence, conveners of collaborative activities of CB-IPs ought to improve farmers’ attitudes through organizing beneficial activities and building their capacity to participate. This study contributed to the body of knowledge by using a behavioural perspective to examine the socio-psychological factors that influence farmers’ continued participation in collaboration activities of CB-IPs. © 2022 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.

AB  - Children's unexpected cardiac arrest warrants cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by kindergarten teachers. Yet, recent research revealed trained personnel reporting poor transfer of acquired skills during real-world emergencies with conventional CPR training. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) training induces a greater sense of presence and agency than conventional CPR training and may be more effective in terms of increasing trainees' intention and initiative to perform CPR in real-world emergencies. A quasi-experiment was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the IVR-based CPR training method in terms of enhancing the intention to perform CPR. The trial enrolled 50 participants, 25 of whom examined a child patient in an IVR virtual scenario, using an AED, and performed two rounds of two-minute chest compressions. The remaining 25 participants were trained using a video with consistent content on a monitor. A generalised estimating equation analysis demonstrated that the IVR training method significantly increased prospective kindergarten teachers' self-efficacy for performing CPR, positive attitudes towards CPR, and CPR knowledge. This advantage was also maintained after the five-week follow-up. Thus, CPR teaching via IVR looks to be an excellent way to enhance the intention to perform CPR and may be of great value in improving existing CPR training systems. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Many trainees who have received traditional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training hesitate to perform the skills learned in a real-world emergency. The critical determinant of whether an individual performs a behaviour is the individual's ‘intention’ to perform that behaviour. Individual's self-efficacy to perform CPR, attitudes towards CPR, and perceived social norms are three determinants that influence intention to perform CPR. Immersive media such as virtual reality may elicit more attitudinal changes and a greater sense of learner self-efficacy than current mainstream media. What this paper adds The study's results indicated that compared to conventional technology-supported video training, immersive virtual reality (IVR) training significantly increased participants' self-efficacy about performing CPR, positive attitudes towards CPR and CPR knowledge. CPR training through IVR may enhance trainees' intention to perform CPR in real-world emergencies. Implications for practice and/or policy The effectiveness of combining IVR technology into existing CPR training methods such as mixed reality training, which blends virtual environments with realistic mannequins, should be further examined in the future. IVR may be a more effective medium for enhancing the intention to perform behaviour than conventional technology. Future research could further experiment with the use of IVR as a behavioural intervention technique in education. © 2022 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - This study attempted to investigate the effects of perceived organizational support (POS) and role clarity on volunteer satisfaction, the mediating role of attitudes toward volunteering in the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and attitudes toward civic participation, and the moderating role of self-efficacy toward service in the relationships between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction among mandatory volunteers. Using data conducted at a major event in Wuhan, China, results showed that POS and role clarity predicted volunteer satisfaction. Volunteer satisfaction positively influenced attitudes toward volunteering, which is linked to attitudes toward civic participation. Self-efficacy toward service moderated the associations between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction, highlighting its essential role in strengthening the effects of organizational climate factors on volunteer satisfaction. Our findings underline the important role of organizations in increasing mandatory volunteers’ satisfaction that affects positive attitudes toward volunteering, leading to enhanced attitudes toward civic participation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Although new forms of media and technology have contributed to teaching and learning in Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) since the turn of this century, an abrupt expansion in the use of interactive technologies occurred more recently due to the need for social distancing on a global scale because of the covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. In the Brazilian context, pedagogical relationships became mediated synchronously and asynchronously via online platforms. This reconfiguration restricted movement-related experiences in Physical Education, which affected the diversity of students’ embodiment of knowledge and their relationships to knowledge as “subject-bodies”. We understand that there is an anthropological foundation in the theory of the relationship to knowledge — pointed out by Charlot (2020) — that comes close to the anthropological demands explained by Daolio (2001) in Physical Education. © 2022, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant consequences on public health and lifestyle and has negatively affected mental health and the level of physical activity worldwide. This study examined the impact of reopening fitness centers and nonessential services and introducing flexible measures to ensure social distancing on physical activity and mental health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal study. A self-administered questionnaire, including personal, behavioral, physical activity, perception of health, and mood state disorder information, was answered by 128 Brazilians in June 2020 (during severe restrictive measures) and again in April 2021 (after fitness centers and nonessential services were reopened). RESULTS: The restriction level adopted in April 2021 was significantly lower than that in June 2020 (p<0.001). The level of physical activity (p<0.001) and health status perception (p<0.001) decreased from June 2020 to April 2021. The median values for depression and anxiety did not differ across the study period. CONCLUSIONS: The level of physical activity was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety and depression were not improved following less restrictive social distancing measures and the reopening of fitness centers. Thus, the return to a prepandemic level of physical activity and mental health status may not be automatic. The results presented herein suggest that the decrease in physical activity observed in the population may be challenging in the postpandemic period. © 2022 Verduci Editore s.r.l.

AB  - Though India is no stranger to either epidemics or hate speech, the COVID-19 crisis brought to the surface many of the pre-existing schisms and prejudices that subsequently led to both the Muslim minority community and the Dalit community being cast as miasmic and constant agitators against the central government. In the case of hate speech against the Muslim community, it has led to a peculiar situation wherein the invisible but pervasive Islamophobia that has been plaguing the country from the colonial times has risen it ugly head particularly across regional news channels and social media networks, making the phenomena hyper-visible. The Hindutva1 politicians from the extreme right parties have been indulging in spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, moulding the image of the Muslim community as not only disease-bearers and super-spreaders of COVID-19 virus but also as being anti-national, as the central government has proclaimed ‘a war against the COVID virus’ (The Print, 2020, 26 April). During the initial spread of the virus throughout the country, there was an increasing tendency to show the Muslim community as intentionally spreading the disease or as being ignorant of current medical practices, with multiple TV channels airing the views that the Tablighi Jamaat event (a religious congregation held in March 2020) was marked as a super-spreader event, and with multiple politicians engaging in rumour-mongering and hate-speech against the Muslims, framing the community as a miasmic community that needs to be cleared from India. On the other hand, the hate speech against Dalits in India is much more nuanced, indirect and layered. It began as WhatsApp and Facebook messages extolling the caste system and justifying the discriminatory practice of untouchability2 using the logic of social distancing and progressed to painting Dalits and Dalit spaces as unhygienic disease-scapes. This consequently led to the denial of livelihoods to thousands of domestic workers and unskilled workers who belonged to lower caste groups as they found themselves without jobs as most middle caste upper caste families and business owners fired their employees without notice. The study involves a hermeneutical analysis of news reports of the spread of COVID from newspapers and electronic media in English as well as interviews with at least 100 members of groups on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that propagate extremely communal and casteist material. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Purpose: Despite the end of conflict in 1995, Bosnia–Herzegovina still suffers from unresolved ethnic and social tensions, where fostering social cohesion, active citizenship and mitigating ethnonationalist tensions and politically motivated violence remains among the main goals to achieve transformative peace. This paper, based on quantitative analyses of 3,637 adult respondents, shows that the tendency of Bosnians to be active or violent citizens sometimes overlaps and are not very distinct patterns of behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that differentiate pathways and help explain (un)civil civic behaviours and inform the work of peace and development actors. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a quantitative household survey conducted with a representative sample of 3,637 adults in Bosnia and by using a wide range of statistical tools from scaling to correlation analysis. This data set measures factors and conceptual notions associated with passive, constructive and aggressive civic tendencies and social cohesion in a nuanced way by using different metrics and scales. The survey was designed and conducted by The Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development (SeeD) and the Bosnia–Herzegovina Resilience Initiative in 2020, in partnership with The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and The International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the SCORE Bosnia–Herzegovina study (SeeD, 2020). Findings: Overall, the factors that were discovered to be linked to the manifestation of constructive and aggressive civic tendencies are multidimensional, and range from intergroup relations (e.g. tension, tolerance) to political and civic attitudes (e.g. ethnonationalism, civic responsibility, gender equality), from individual traits (e.g. education, economic stress) to the media landscape (e.g. information consumption). While the empirical evidence shows that some of these factors can push citizens towards both active and violent civic behaviours simultaneously, this study identifies and distinguishes those that can reduce aggressive civic tendencies while increasing constructive civic tendencies. Practical implications: This paper proposes a replicable approach and evidence-based conclusions which can help validate the theories of change for the peace and development actors to ensure that scarce peacebuilding resources are invested where the impact is greatest, and the actors can protect the sanctity of their responsibility to do no harm. Social implications: This paper seeks to provide a robust empirical understanding for more effective policy-making and programming that can support Bosnia–Herzegovina’s endogenous resilience against socio-political shocks and transformative peace trajectory. This paper seeks to demonstrate how peace and development actors can build and use an evidence-base for understanding civic behaviours and as a result formulate tailored efforts with greater likelihood of impact. This would help fulfil commitments towards sustainable development goals and the 2030 global agenda (UN General Assembly, 2015). Originality/value: This study contributes insights to the emerging literature at the nexus of peacebuilding, individual skills/attitudes and civic behaviour. While the conclusions are highly contextual, the methodology is informed by multidisciplinary literature and is replicable in other post-conflict and non-conflict contexts, and thus can be used for cross-country comparisons and theory building around civic activism and constructive citizenship. The approach distinguishes between passive citizens, constructive activists, aggressive activists and purely violent citizens. This study discovers that the bifurcation is between passive citizens and active citizens, and although constructive and aggressive civic tendencies might be theorised to be contradictory, they overlap and tend to co-occur. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of social media use among students, and the way in which it affects their performance and attitude when used in the classroom in Saudi Arabia. The study explores students' attitudes to using social media to perform activities in the classroom and in their future careers. Design/methodology/approach: A convergent mixed methods design was adopted, administering an online survey to a sample of 622 university students and conducting interviews with 20 students. Findings: The results revealed that the relationship between the level of a student's social media usage and GPA (Grade Point Average) was negatively correlated. Moreover, the students with a high level of social media usage generally reported a highly positive attitude towards using social media in classroom activities. Finally, the students' level of social media usage was found to predict their attitude towards performing classroom activities using social media. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for both theory and practice. For example, the findings confirm the ways in which social media are deployed, according to uses and gratification theory. In particular, social media are used by Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University students for escapism, social integration and interaction, establishing personal identity, and meeting affective and cognitive needs. Meanwhile, the theoretical implications of this study are that new dimensions and social media terms can be added to the assumptions of uses and gratification theory. For example, virtual tolerance corresponds to escapism, virtual communication corresponds to integration and social interaction, virtual problems can be matched with personal identity and affective needs, and virtual information corresponds to cognitive needs. Practical implications: On a practical level, the results could be useful for students, teachers, educational policymakers and society. The results would show students how high social media usage could have a negative impact on their performance. Therefore, they should control their usage by managing their time, for example, via time management apps, if necessary. In particular, students could use social media in their learning and to develop their skills. A positive attitude among students, with regard to using social media in classroom activities, should correspondingly increase teachers' use of social media in the teaching process. This implies the expected benefits for teachers of using social media to teach and communicate with students. In addition, policymakers need to use social media as a means of reaching those population segments who display high social media usage, and who are unlikely to use traditional media to connect with those who formulate policy. Social implications: It is important to consider that high levels of social media use have a tendency to affect users' health, causing neck and back pain and psychological issues, for example, stress and depression. This points to a pressing need for society's institutions to raise public awareness of the disadvantages of high social media usage. Originality/value: This study could serve as a useful source of information for faculty members seeking to integrate social media into their curricula. It could also encourage students to activate social media in their learning and communication with teachers and peers, while at the same time reducing their non-academic social media usage. This study provides a scale for measuring students' social media usage and attitudes to undertaking classroom activities via social media in the Saudi context. The scale is validated through adaptation of the scales developed by Sahin (2018) and Kitchakarn (2016). © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the discourse, semantic and sentiment analysis of the medical professional forum publications. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) within the professional community on the portal MirVracha reveals a diversity of peculiarities of medical professional discourse since the portal includes informal posts and chats alongside official and scientific publications. We study materials of MirVracha published in summer 2020 – winter 2021 (dataset includes more than 0.5 million words). We reveal dominant semantic categories of online medical professional discourse and examine the dynamic of topics discussed in the publications against the backdrop of the pandemic situation and social events. The dominant semantic categories of online medical professional discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic are the Diagnosis and Research categories. Based on the results of discourse analysis, we describe the interests and attitudes of the portal users and linguistic means they use to verbalize their attitudes within the professional community. The medical professionals are primarily interested in research materials and outcomes. Based on sentiment analysis, we uncover attitudes revealed in the publications. Medical professional CMC shows mainly neutral attitudes to the topics. In the posts and personal narratives, the portal users discuss political context and express the negative attitude in posts associated with semantic Diagnosis and Bureaucracy categories. © 2022 Belgorod State National Research University.

AB  - Building on the health belief model (HBM), this research tests, over six months, how the exposure to COVID-related information in the media affects fear, which in turn conditions beliefs about the severity of the virus, susceptibility of getting the virus, and benefits of safety measures. These health beliefs ultimately lead to social distancing and panic buying. As a first contribution, we find that fear is not directly triggered by the objective severity of a crisis, but rather formed over time by the way individuals are exposed to media. Second, we show that fear affects behaviors through the components of the HBM which relate to the risks/benefits of a situation. Last, we find that critical thinking about media content amplifies the “adaptive” responses of our model (e.g., health beliefs, social distancing) and reduces its “maladaptive” responses (e.g., panic buying). Interestingly, we note that the beneficial effect of critical thinking about media content disappears as the level of fear increases over time. The implications of these findings for policymakers, media companies, and theory are further discussed. © 2022, Academy of Marketing Science.

AB  - INTRODUCTION COVID-19 has placed excess stress on the antenatal health care system and added additional complexity to expecting mothers. This study aimed to study the attitude and precautionary practices of non-infected pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out interviewing all 195 pregnant women attending an antenatal care outpatient department in Nepal, between 15 March and 16 April 2021, using a pretested questionnaire. Precautionary practices were defined as the practice of social distancing, wearing masks, and sanitizing or washing hands, by the mothers during the antenatal period with a 5-point Likert scale for each item Precautionary practices were categorized into good (≥ median score) and poor(< median score). RESULTS The majority of the women who participated in this study were from aged 20–29 years (71.7%), were Brahmin (48.2%) and 84.6% Hindu. Since 46.2% of women assumed the close contact of mother to child as safe practice with specific precautions, only 17.9% were willing to isolate themselves if infected by COVID-19. Overall, 35.9% of the respondents were only willing to breastfeed their newborn, even with specific precaution if infected. Nearly half of the respondents (47.2%) had poor precautionary practice during the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of precautionary practices was found significantly associated with age and occupational status. CONCLUSIONS Most of the respondents were concerned about the threats of mother to child transmission but found to have poor precautionary practices towards COVID-19. Thus, adequate counselling regarding COVID related issues during an antenatal checkup is required to be provided by health workers to break their perceived stigma for better maternal and neonatal outcomes © 2022 Thapa T. et al.

AB  - The current research examined the potential effects of age-morphing technology as a communication tool on reducing ageism and promoting positive attitude and behavioral intention to address issues affecting older adults. Two competing theoretical frameworks—construal level theory (CLT) and perspective taking (PT)—were tested as underlying mechanisms to understand the technology’s effects. In two online experiments, we examined the main and interaction effects of construal level manipulated using the technology and perceived probability of getting Alzheimer’s Disease on ageism, attitude toward helping older adults, behavioral and donation intentions (Study 1) and explored message appeals as a boundary condition to improve the potential negative outcomes of technology-mediated communication (Study 2). The findings revealed that an age-morphed image led to more concrete construal of one’s future life as an older adult. An age-morphed image combined with high perceived probability led to less stereotypical thoughts about older adults and more supporting intentions to address the issue. However, it showed that for low perceived probability, an age-morphed image resulted in less favorable outcomes. The findings showed that a model based on CLT can explain the effects as an underlying mechanism. This research indicates that the effects of age-morphing technology vary but that the technology still can be used as a strategic communication tool that might elicit favorable outcomes depending on how it is combined with perceived probability and message appeals. © Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Physically less attractive job applicants are discriminated against in hiring decisions. In a US context, the authors tested whether appearance-altering photo-filters can exploit this bias, focusing on the moderating role of job type, gender and race as well the mediating role of two major dimensions of person perception (warmth and competence). Design/methodology/approach: In study 1, 223 managers evaluated White mock applicants presented with or without a beautifying filter for either a position as a social worker or an IT specialist. In study 2, 212 managers evaluated Black and White mock applicants with or without beautifying filters for an HR specialist position. Findings: In study 1, beautifying filters increased perceived hireability irrespective of job type, but especially when applicants were female. Both male and female applicants whose photos were filtered were perceived as more competent, but only male applicants were perceived as warmer. In study 2, beautifying filters increased the hireability only slightly for White female applicants, followed by White and Black male applicants but substantially for Black female applicants. The filters increased the perceived competence of Black (and especially Black female) applicants but not of White applicants and increased the perceived warmth of all groups except for White females. Warmth and competence partially mediated the observed effects on hireability in both studies. Originality/value: In the context of widely available technological advances, the authors show that beautifying photo-filters can exploit attractiveness biases, at least at an early hiring stage. The results emphasize the importance of intersecting factors such as gender and race. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Measures implemented to combat the spread of COVID-19 have included stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and self-isolation, all of which have limited in-person interactions. Given the key role of technology in maintaining social connections during this period, the current study examined the experiences of young adults who shifted from predominantly offline to online interaction with friends during COVID-19. Specifically, we investigated whether changing from interacting predominantly with friends in-person to interacting predominantly with friends online (conceptualized as a major change in context of interaction) was associated with lower social well-being (i.e., greater loneliness and lower social connectedness), and examined whether perceived changes in friendship satisfaction as a result of the pandemic mediated these effects. Participants (N = 329; 68.1% female) were Australian young adults, aged between 17 and 25 years (Mage = 20.05 years, SD = 1.97). Data were collected between April 15th and May 24th, 2020, during the nationwide lockdown in Australia. Results indicated that for young adults who primarily interacted offline with friends prior to COVID-19 (as compared to those who interacted predominantly online or equally online and offline before the pandemic), the shift away from face-to-face interactions was associated with a greater perceived reduction in satisfaction with friendships, which, in turn, was associated with greater loneliness and lower social connectedness. Our results highlight the need to consider how young adults adjust to changes in contexts for engaging with friends and how they maintain meaningful social interactions with others during times of extended physical isolation. © Author(s).

AB  - Influencing and framing debates on Twitter provides power to shape public opinion. Bots have become essential tools of ‘computational propaganda' on social media such as Twitter, often contributing to a large fraction of the tweets regarding political events such as elections. Although analyses have been conducted regarding the first impeachment of former president Donald Trump, they have been focused on either a manual examination of relatively few tweets to emphasize rhetoric, or the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) of a much larger corpus with respect to common metrics such as sentiment. In this paper, we complement existing analyses by examining the role of bots in the first impeachment with respect to three questions as follows. (Q1) Are bots actively involved in the debate? (Q2) Do bots target one political affiliation more than another? (Q3) Which sources are used by bots to support their arguments? Our methods start with collecting over 13M tweets on six key dates, from October 6th 2019 to January 21st 2020. We used machine learning to evaluate the sentiment of the tweets (via BERT) and whether it originates from a bot. We then examined these sentiments with respect to a balanced sample of Democrats and Republicans directly relevant to the impeachment, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, senator Mitch McConnell, and (then former Vice President) Joe Biden. The content of posts from bots was further analyzed with respect to the sources used (with bias ratings from AllSides and Ad Fontes) and themes. Our first finding is that bots have played a significant role in contributing to the overall negative tone of the debate (Q1). Bots were targeting Democrats more than Republicans (Q2), as evidenced both by a difference in ratio (bots had more negative-to-positive tweets on Democrats than Republicans) and in composition (use of derogatory nicknames). Finally, the sources provided by bots were almost twice as likely to be from the right than the left, with a noticeable use of hyper-partisan right and most extreme right sources (Q3). Bots were thus purposely used to promote a misleading version of events. Overall, this suggests an intentional use of bots as part of a strategy, thus providing further confirmation that computational propaganda is involved in defining political events in the United States. As any empirical analysis, our work has several limitations. For example, Trump's rhetoric on Twitter has previously been characterized by an overly negative tone, thus tweets detected as negative may be echoing his message rather than acting against him. Previous works show that this possibility is limited, and its existence would only strengthen our conclusions. As our analysis is based on NLP, we focus on processing a large volume of tweets rather than manually reading all of them, thus future studies may complement our approach by using qualitative methods to assess the specific arguments used by bots. © 2022.

AB  - This study explores the effect of priming gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis and Germans. It aims to contribute a new theoretical perspective on the importance of gendered stereotypes in media discourses. Drawing on previous research, which suggests a theoretical model for examining the indirect effect of stereotypical gendered stereotypes in predicting emotions and attitudes toward outgroups during political conflicts, this study aims to explore the effect of stereotypical gendered priming on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees. It uses three online experiments conducted among Germans and Jewish-Israelis: the first two studies examine the effect of gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis; the third replicates this model in Germany in order to explore the effect of gendered stereotypes on attitudes toward refugees there. Such empirical examination can promote a better understanding of the role of exposure to gendered stereotypes in shaping public opinion toward marginalized groups. It may also contribute to attempts to promote constructive political debate and media coverage by specifically addressing the societal constructs—gendered stereotypes—that can potentially advance positive political attitudes and behavior. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper presents the evolution of fake news disseminated about vaccines and the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its adverse impacts on the current Brazilian health crisis. This quantitative, empirical study is based on the notifications re-ceived by the Eu Fiscalizo app, through which the Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp pla-tforms were identified as the principal means for disseminating and sharing rumors and misinfor-mation about COVID-19. We observed large-sca-le circulation of fake news about vaccines directly related to the Brazilian political polarization, which became prevalent four months after the first COVID-19 case was recorded in the country. We can conclude that this phenomenon was crucial in discouraging the adherence of segments of the Brazilian population to social distancing and vac-cination campaigns. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - With the multiple waves of COVID-19 in China and other countries, there is an urgent need to design effective containment, especially nonpharmaceutical interventions, to combat the transmission. Media reports on COVID-19 - which can induce precautionary behaviour such as social distancing, by providing disease-related information to the public - are thought to be effective in containing the spread. We include the media-reporting data collected from authoritative and popular websites, along with the corresponding IP-visiting data, to study the effects of media reports in curbing the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing. To quantify how social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19, we differentiate the fully susceptible from those susceptibles who are media aware and practice social distancing or are quarantined. We propose a discrete compartment model with the fully susceptible, the media-aware susceptible, and the quarantined susceptible as three separate classes. We adopt functions dependent on the media reports and the contacts of media-aware susceptibles to describe the progression rate of susceptibles to media-aware susceptibles. By fitting the targeted model to data on the two Beijing outbreaks, we estimated the reproduction numbers for the two outbreaks as R0=1.6818 and R0=1.3251, respectively. Cross-correlation analysis on our collected data suggests a strong correlation between the media reporting and epidemic case data. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis show that even with the intensified interventions in force, reducing either the social distancing uptake rate or the average duration of social distancing for media-aware susceptibles could aggravate the severity of the two outbreaks in Beijing by magnifying the final confirmed cases and lengthening the end time of the pandemic. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing social distancing and media reporting alone, if done in sufficient measures, are enough to alleviate the COVID-19 epidemic. © 2022 Yinjiao Gong et al.

AB  - Although the effect of temperature on consumers is ubiquitous, little is known about how temperature affects consumers' attitudes toward nostalgic advertising. Drawing on embodied cognition theory, this study explores the effect of temperature on consumers' attitudes toward nostalgic advertising through the mediator of the affective system. Based on two experiments involving personal and historical nostalgic advertising, our results show that when exposed to comfortable temperature, consumers follow the “assimilative effect” of temperature; warm temperatures trigger more positive attitudes toward nostalgic advertising when compared with cool temperatures. However, when exposed to uncomfortable temperatures, consumers follow the “complementary effect” of temperatures; cold temperatures lead to more positive attitudes toward nostalgic advertising than hot temperatures. Furthermore, the affective system plays a mediating role between temperature and consumers' attitudes toward nostalgic advertising. This study contributes to the literature on temperature in marketing and provides a practical guide for companies to implement nostalgic advertising strategies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has made videoconferencing tools an essential part of our lives as these tools are what allowed us to keep in touch in a time of social distancing. Having said that, however, many people have found virtual interactions to be surprisingly exhausting. This has given rise to the concept of Zoom fatigue. The purpose of this article is to explore the dynamics that give rise to this peculiar phenomenon. The article first discusses the concept of Zoom fatigue and critiques the brain-centrism of current explanations. It then proposes a more embodied approach to interaction, discusses the mediating role of technology in videoconferencing, and proceeds to presents a list of five videoconferencing dynamics that may induce Zoom fatigue: Awkward turn-taking, inhibited spontaneity, restricted motility, lack of eye contact and increased self-awareness. Finally, it is argued that these dynamics should make us temper our collective expectations about the hybrid future. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - While the World Health Organization advised against referring to COVID-19 using racial overtones, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread, many disparagingly called it the “Wuhan virus,” the “Chinese virus,” and other terms. In this context, the FBI warned police agencies about an expected increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the early months of the pandemic. But, while some researchers and media outlets discussed these potential increases at length, very few studies have been able to directly assess the nature of anti-Asian hate and bias victimization during the pandemic. Following this, the current study directly examines variation in anti-Asian bias and victimization in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, this research presents results from two studies using a survey of 3,163 non-Asian and 575 Asian American and Pacific Islander respondents, respectively. The first study examines the prevalence of anti-Asian xenophobia among the non-Asian sample and assesses differences in these prejudicial attitudes across respondent characteristics, while the second study examines variation in experiences with bias during the pandemic among the Asian sample. The results illustrate the ubiquity of anti-Asian sentiment, suggesting that those who indicate greater fear of the pandemic report more prejudicial attitudes, as well as important racial differences in these patterns. The results also demonstrate the extent to which the pandemic has impacted individual experiences with anti-Asian bias victimization, such that more than one-third of Asian respondents report bias victimization during the pandemic, and more than half of Asian respondents report that they know someone who has been victimized. These patterns have important implications for addressing COVID-19-related hate crime moving forward. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - We examine the relationship between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians by proposing a conceptual model explaining the role of key mediating variables such as identification, narrative transportation, enjoyment, and political self-efficacy in influencing the attitude of the viewers of international TV drama towards female role models (politicians). We investigated the direct and indirect effects between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians by recruiting 359 students from two large public universities in the Southeastern United States. The hypothesized model supported the evidence presented in extant scholarship, suggesting that a meaningful entertainment experience could foster an appreciation of the fictional televisual entertainment and positively change attitudes toward female lead characters playing the role of a viable and competent politician. This study resonates with politicians, academics, and activists’ concerns that a positive media portrayal could promote the acceptability of female leaders in powerful positions. Our study clarifies the direct and indirect effects between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians and the role of crucial mediating variables such as identification, narrative transportation, enjoyment, and political self-efficacy in influencing the attitude of the viewers of international TV drama towards female politicians. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) developed a ‘Working Definition of Antisemitism’ in 2016. Whilst the definition has received a significant amount of media attention, we are not aware of any comprehensive philosophical analysis. This article analyses this definition. We conclude that the definition and its list of examples ought to be rejected. The urgency to do so stems from the fact that pro-Israel activists can and have mobilised the IHRA document for political goals unrelated to tackling antisemitism, notably to stigmatise and silence critics of the Israeli government. This causes widespread self-censorship, has an adverse impact on freedom of speech, and impedes action against the unjust treatment of Palestinians. We also identify intrinsic problems in the way the definition refers to criticism of Israel similar ‘to that leveled against any other country’, ambiguous wording about ‘the power of Jews as a collective’, lack of clarity as to the Jewish people’s ‘right to self-determination’, and its denial of obvious racism. We consider alternative definitions and prefer one like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) definition, ‘hostility to or prejudice against Jews’, with the addition of the words ‘as Jews’. We recognise that the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) can play a useful purpose in illustrating the shortcomings of the IHRA definition. However, we do not advocate promoting it as the prime international definition. Indeed, we question the efficacy of using complex new definitions to combat racism against Jews or other groups, and instead advocate combatting it through collective action across societies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The changes in teaching due to COVID-19-related restraints generated distress among teachers, putting their job-related efficacy and satisfaction at risk. This study deepens the community-related protective and risk factors in teachers' experience. An online questionnaire detecting social distancing burnout, job-related distress experience, efficacy and satisfaction, and Sense of Community (SoC) was administered to 307 Italian teachers. A multiple mediation model was tested with Structural Equation Modeling. Evidence showed that social distancing burnout could increase teachers' distress rates and, through them, impact their job-related efficacy and satisfaction; however, its effects on the latter depended on the kind of distress mediating. Conversely, SoC could support their job-related efficacy and satisfaction, yet no association with their distress rates emerged. The role of social distancing and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)-related distress as the main threats for teachers stems, along with the one of job distress and the community of belonging as assets on which teachers relied. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Objectives: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-like illness (CLI) during March - August 2020 in New York City, and to test effect modification by age, nativity, and working from home vs outside the home, and mediation via social distancing behavior. Design: Analysis of the monthly Community Health Survey datasets. Setting: New York City. Participants: 5,305 adults living in New York City. Methods: Prevalence of having CLI was compared among racial and ethnic groups using multivariable log-linear regression. Stratified and causal mediation analyses were conducted to test effect modification and mediation, respectively. Main Outcome Measures: A binary indicator of having new onset of CLI in the past 30 days. Results: Overall percentage of CLI decreased from 25% during March-May to 14% during June-August. In both periods, there was no increased prevalence of CLI among Black or Latino New Yorkers compared with White New Yorkers. However, in stratified analyses, Latino vs White New Yorkers had 2.05 times (95%CI=1.09, 3.83) higher prevalence of CLI among adults working outside the home. Mediation via social distancing was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Excess burden of CLI among Latino adults working outside the home underscores inequitable impacts of COVID-19 in New York City. © 2022 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current emergence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has put the world in threat. Social distancing, quarantine and governmental measures such as lockdowns, social isolation, and public hygiene are helpful in fighting the pandemic, while awareness campaigns through social media (radio, TV, etc.) are essential for their implementation. On this basis, we propose and analyse a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission influenced by awareness campaigns through social media. A time delay factor due to the reporting of the infected cases has been included in the model for making it more realistic. Existence of equilibria and their stability, and occurrence of Hopf bifurcation have been studied using qualitative theory. We have derived the basic reproduction number (R0) which is dependent on the rate of awareness. We have successfully shown that public awareness has a significant role in controlling the pandemic. We have also seen that the time delay destabilizes the system when it crosses a critical value. In sum, this study shows that public awareness in the form of social distancing, lockdowns, testing, etc. can reduce the pandemic with a tolerable time delay. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - This study seeks to granularly document the fundamental aspects of the pandemic and its effect on the global scale and environmental steadiness. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is therefore utilized to analyze these constructs. The study results show that the pathway coefficient for the parameters, such as health awareness, naturalism, mediation, personal development, sustainability, sociability, empathy, and cooperation, illustrates that the parameters directly impact pandemic control and management. At the same time, the lockdown and social distance rules attain dire consequences on the “conventional” retail property sector. It might speed up the evolution procedure of different conduits retail plus the channel coupling performance of physical stores and, hence, cause changes in urban areas–retail sector. The pandemic isn’t necessarily leading to the shutdown of retail stores. Nonetheless, it might have a meaningful effect on the retail estate enterprise business. The results show a requirement for the rapid physical shop repositioning performance of different channels firms. The study presents a meaningful understanding and demonstrates many consequences for the retailers, Landlords, and equally policy crafting components tackling urban regeneration plus local economic advancement within the post-covid phase. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: on 16th March 2020, Tanzania announced its first COVID-19 case. The country had already developed a 72-hour response plan and had enacted three compulsory infection prevention and control interventions. Here, we describe public compliance to Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) public health measures in Dar es Salaam during the early COVID-19 response and testing of the feasibility of an observational method. Methods: a cross sectional study was conducted between April and May 2020 in Dar es Salaam City. At that time, Dar es Salaam was the epi centre of the epidemic. Respondents were randomly selected from defined population strata (high, medium and low). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and through observations. Results: a total of 390 subjects were interviewed, response rate was 388 (99.5%). Mean age of the respondents was 34.8 years and 168 (43.1%) had primary level education. Out of the 388 respondents, 384 (98.9%) reported to have heard about COVID-19 public health and social measures, 90.0% had heard from the television and 84.6% from the radio. Covering coughs and sneezes using a handkerchief was the most common behaviour observed among 320 (82.5%) respondents; followed by hand washing hygiene practice, 312 (80.4%) and wearing face masks, 240 (61.9%). Approximately 215 (55.4%) adhered to physical distancing guidance. Age and gender were associated with compliance to IPC measures (both, p&lt;0.05). Conclusion: compliance to public health measures during the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic in this urban setting was encouraging. As the pandemic continues, it is critical to ensure compliance is sustained and capitalize on risk communication via television and radio. © Janneth Maridadi Mghamba et al.

AB  - Background: It is imperative to ensure optimal vaccine uptake at the population level to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic disease. However, refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine, poor knowledge, and a negative attitude towards vaccination are the challenges of the world. College students are among the high-risk subgroups of the population to COVID-19 infection and the main source of information and trust in vaccines to the society. Also, their judgement on vaccine affect the public attitude towards vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors among college students in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 626 study participants in Gondar city. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. The level of significance was claimed based on a p-value < 0.05. Results: In this study, 46.8% (95% CI: 43.3, 50.6) of study participants had good knowledge and 50% (95% CI: 45.9, 53.7) had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Having comorbidity disease and being male were significantly associated with good knowledge. In addition, being married, being a health science student, being exposed to mass media, having a good knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination, and having paternal primary education were significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: In general, knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination among college students are low. Comorbidity disease and sex were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination knowledge, whereas, marital status, category of college students, mass media, paternal education and knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination attitude. Alleviating participants’ concerns and improving their confidence through health education is crucial. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In 2019, the HBO limited television series Watchmen aired to critical acclaim. A contemporary extension of the world established by the 1986-87 Watchmen comic, viewers and commentators alike have viewed the show as a critical commentary on racial politics in the United States. Using Nexis Uni’s News Database, we conducted an inductive qualitative content analysis of 31 news articles written by mainstream television critics and/or writers about the show. Across reviews, three primary themes emerged—White supremacy, revisionist history (specifically pertaining to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921), and the power of masks. The role of critics/writers in engaging audiences with themes about race is discussed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective The Covid-19 pandemic had a global impact. The study explores the various Covid-19 experiences in Malta over the past year and provides a snapshot of acute and post-acute Covid-19 symptoms, as well as national vaccination roll-out and hesitancy. Methods Data on medical access, lifestyle habits, acute and post-acute Covid-19 symptoms and vaccination hesitancy was gathered through a social media survey targeting adults of Malta. Covid-19 data was gathered from the Malta Ministry of Health Covid-19 dashboard. Results Malta controlled Covid-19 spread exceptionally well initially. Since August 2020 the positivity rate, mortality and hospital admission rates saw a fluctuating incline. From COVID-19 onset a decrease in physical activity and an increase in body weight was reported. Most participants acquiring COVID-19 were asymptomatic but nontrivial proportion experienced post-acute symptoms. The majority opted to take the Covid-19 vaccine with only a minority expressing safety concerns. Conclusions Malta has experienced roller coaster events over a year. The population faced elevated levels of morbidity, mortality, and economic hardship along with negative and positive risk-associated behaviours. Vaccination in combination with population adherence to social distancing, mask wearing, and personal hygiene are expected to be the beacons of hope in the coming months. © 2022 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.

AB  - StyleLikeU is a hugely successful online social media platform that presents itself as a social justice movement related to body acceptance. Presenting moving personal stories, it offers a site for what it calls ‘diverse individuals’ to share their experiences as part of promoting individual self-acceptance in the face of a world that prioritizes one kind of body over another, which take the form of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, sizeism and prejudice against disfigurement. Drawing out the discursive script carried across the platform, we show how, beneath the rhetoric of progressiveness, social justice becomes a kind of personal therapy, related to empowerment and transformation, which erases actual differences in personal circumstances and the very forces of injustice. We place StyleLikeU into broader scholarly concerns about the neoliberal colonization of identity politics, diversity and intersectionality in institutions and in branding, drawing attention to how this can form one part of what are now presented as social justice movements. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - For controlling the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections, the Bangladesh Government imposed lockdown to ensure social distancing among the mass. The study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on social relationships among Bangladeshi nationals. A social media-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 15 through June 7, 2020. The study used a survey questionnaire to ascertain the people's perception on COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown, and on how the lockdown affected their social relationships. In this study, social relationships referred to the connections between family members, friends, and relatives. Linear regression was employed to determine the predictors of social relationships. A total of 352 survey responses were collected, out of which 64.2 per cent reported that their social relationships became stronger during lockdown. Age, marital status, occupation, and financial condition exhibited significant associations with social relationships. More specifically, young through middle-aged, married, housewives, and financially solvent people had a significant association with having strong social relationships. This study found that the COVID-19 lockdown revealed a positive impact on the social relationships of Bangladeshis. Healthy bonding and cordial support of family and friends are understood to have helped them to mitigate their mental stress, leading to positive health implications. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Hostile attitudes toward refugees are on the rise, yet individuals who hold negative beliefs toward out-groups are the most difficult to persuade. Is an explicit persuasive appeal effective for such groups, or should fictional narratives with implicit messages be used instead? An online experiment (N = 1, 749) was conducted to test this possibility with three possible media-based interventions: a fictional sympathetic portrayal, a fictional hostile portrayal, or a documentary-based portrayal. Hostile portrayals increased negative attitudes toward refugees, while documentary portrayals increased positive attitudes and promoted stereotype reversal. These effects were observed regardless of nationalism or social dominance orientation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Muslims constitute about one percent of the U.S. population. Ten percent of U.S. media stories on domestic violence (DV) focus on American Muslims, implying a higher-than-average rate of DV in the American Muslim community. Our study estimates the prevalence of DV among Muslim women in greater Boston and compares it to DV rates among American women as a whole. The study also examines the effect of education, income, and employment status on DV in both samples in comparison with each other. We anonymously surveyed 332 American Muslim women over the age of 18 at five mosques in the greater Boston area and found the DV rate among our study participants to be comparable with that among American women in general. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth) as a surrogate for the U.S. as a whole. Our study participants experienced less intimate partner violence and more aggression from parents and siblings than the women in AddHealth. Also, rising socioeconomic and employment status were not buffers against DV in our study as they were for the AddHealth participants. Ethnicity or country of birth had no impact on DV risk among the women in our study. These results are important because they counter the bias in U.S. media that implies DV is more prevalent among American Muslims than in the U.S. population at large. Our data also suggests measures to ameliorate DV in American Muslims need to target the whole family (i.e., parents and children of both genders). © 2022 Michigan Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - COVID-19 has affected university medical students, resulting in the new norm of learning and practice. Understanding these students' knowledge, attitude and their practice would be essential as they would serve as the future doctor in Malaysia. The study attempted to evaluate medical students' knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in the east coast states of Peninsular Malaysia. An online and multi centre cross-sectional study was undertaken among all the three public medical schools in the east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia, between 8th July to 21st July 2020. The questionnaire consisted of sociodemographic data and the three domains which included COVID-19 KAP. Students were invited to participate via social media platform such as WhatsApp and students' email. A total of 1,008 medical students voluntarily participated in the study with female to male ratio of 2.6:1. A total of 356 (35.3%) of the medical students had satisfactory knowledge score, with 75% of them were female. The majority of the students had positive attitude towards COVID-19 and practiced meticulous social distancing during the pandemic. We noted that seniority influenced knowledge score, and this was evident as 264 (26.2%) of the students were in their clinical year. Overall, the knowledge scores regarding COVID-19 among the medical students in East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia was reasonable and there were opportunities to augment these standards. Meticulous plans are needed to enhance knowledge and preparedness of the current crops of medical students to be competent future frontliner for Malaysia. © Malaysian Association of Education in Medicine and Health Sciences and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia. 2022

AB  - There is evidence that perceived health status is relevant for older adults' wellbeing, and at the same time perceived health status can be influenced by self-perceptions of ageing. There is a lack of studies on the relationship between these variables. The aim of this study was to explore attitudes towards ageing and self-perceptions of ageing among Spanish middle-aged and older people, and to identify possible mediators in the relationship between self-perceptions of ageing on perceived health status. The sample comprised 1,124 individuals from 50 to 98 years old (mean = 64.84, standard deviation = 10.12) from the Ageing in Spain Longitudinal Study database, Pilot Survey (ELES-PS). Almost 70 per cent of the participants stated that old age begins at a specific chronological age and half of them considered that society treats older people with indifference. Self-perceptions of ageing, physical activity, cognitive functioning and age were significant predictors, and together these variables explained 15.9 per cent in the variance of perceived health status. The multiple mediation analysis revealed that self-perceptions of ageing predicted cognitive functioning (B = 0.848, p < 0.01) and physical activity (B = 2.9046, p < 0.001), and mediated the association between self-perceptions of ageing and perceived health status (B = 0.1144, standard error = 0.0147, p < 0.01). Results from this study highlight the importance of perceptions and attitudes towards ageing for older adults' health and wellbeing, thus this study contributes to a better understanding of how these variables are related. In this sense, results from this study can be useful for designing interventions for fostering wellbeing. Addressing negative self-perceptions of ageing and negative attitudes towards ageing can be particularly useful because they are associated with more pessimistic expectancies about the ageing process.

AB  - Introduction: with this fast-increasing pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, all mankind is at risk of infection unless they get vaccinated and all African countries shall incorporate COVID-19 vaccination in their health care programs as long as the world work cooperatively. The pandemic, as the World Health Organization (WHO) stated, could be mitigated when 70% of the population which is nearly 5.6 billion should be immunized and to achieve this objective, the willingness of the community to be vaccinated before vaccination is essential. Methods: institutional-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 1st, 2021, up to 30th May, 2021, in South Gondar Province, North Central Ethiopia. A structured interviewer-administered pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. The collected data were entered into EPI data version 4.2 and then exported into SPSS window version 22. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken and information was presented by using simple frequency tables and pie charts. Results: the majority of the respondents who accepted the COVID-19 vaccine accounted for nearly 260 (65%, 95% CI: 60-69). Positive attitude (AOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.30-11.20), good knowledge (AOR 13, 95% CI: 6-27), bachelor of sciences (B.Sc) and above educational level (AOR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.30-6), TV or radio as source of information (AOR 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04-0.30), social media as source of information (AOR 0.04, 95% CI: 0.01-0.2), political leaders (AOR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.90) were predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Conclusion: healthcare professionals (HCPs) with the decision (yes, sure) for COVID-19 vaccine uptake during data collection were found to be low as compared to other studies. Positive attitude, good knowledge, B.Sc, and above educational level were predictors enhancing COVID-19 vaccination uptake and TV or radio as a source of information, social media as a source of information and political leaders were factors decreasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Hence, it might be important to prioritize knowledge and attitude creation programs for HCPs and an alternative way of source of information and agents for the COVID-19 vaccine other than social media and religious leaders. © Solomon Demis Kebede et al.

AB  - Background: The prevention of anaemia among under-fives is largely contributed by the caregiver's knowledge, attitude, and practice in the preparation of foods and feeding practices. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anaemia and caregiver's knowledge, attitude, and practices towards its prevention among under-fives in Zanzibar. Methods: A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted which included 594 caregivers and their under-fives from April to June 2020 in Zanzibar. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice were determined using binary logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was done to control all other variables. SPSS version 23.0 was used to analyse the data. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The overall prevalence of anaemia among under-fives was 69.1%, 43.8%, 22.9%, and 2.4% of the under-fives had mild, moderate, and severe anaemia, respectively. Caregivers’ knowledge, attitude and practice were 36.7%, 43.4%, and 49.8%, respectively. Having low family income, receiving information from family members, and mass media were the predictors of low level knowledge (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.32 – 0.92, p = 0.022, AOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32–0.90, p = 0.018, and AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.15 – 0.76, p = 0.009, respectively). Living in rural part of North Pemba district had a protective effect against negative attitude (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.23–0.66, p = 0.000). Having more than four under-fives and receiving information from media were the predictors of reduced chance of caregivers’ good practice (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.28 – 0.91, p = 0.024, AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.17–0.96, p = 0.041, respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of anaemia among under-fives in this study was quite high and alarming. This was reflected by low knowledge, attitude, and poor feeding practices. This study has shown that living in the rural area was associated with less chance of having good knowledge, a positive attitude, and good feeding practices for the prevention of anaemia. Emphasis should be made on raising the level of knowledge, attitude, and feeding practice, particularly for caregivers residing in rural areas. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Authors suggest that in liberal contexts, groups considered as lacking autonomy, such as people with schizophrenia, can face stigma. Following Social Dominance theory, we hypothesized that perceived autonomy of people with schizophrenia mediates the relation between SDO and stigmatizing attitudes. Participants from the general population (N = 255; 76.5% women, Mage = 25.33, SD = 12.3) responded to our questionnaire assessing one’s SDO, perceived autonomy and stigmatizing attitudes towards schizophrenia (i.e., dangerousness and desired social distance). Analysis of direct paths from SDO to perceived autonomy (b = −.45, p <.001) and from the latter to perceived dangerousness (b = −.33, p <.001) and to social distance (b = −.46, p <.001), as well as analysis of indirect paths (b =.15, p <.01) for perceived dangerousness (b =.25, p <.001 for social distance), confirmed our hypotheses, and our model showed a good data fit. Our results provide evidence for the stigmatizing role of the autonomy ideal for people with disabilities and invite further development regarding anti-stigma efforts. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Social media is Internet-based by design, allowing people to share content quickly via electronic means. People can openly express their thoughts on social media sites such as Twitter, which can then be shared with other people. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models. Deep belief neural network (DBN) with pseudo labelling is used to classify the tweets. Top layers of the base classifiers are boosted in the pseudo labelling strategy, whereas lower levels of the base classifiers share weights for feature extraction. By introducing the pseudo boost mechanism, our suggested technique preserves the same time complexity as a DBN while achieving fast convergence to optimality. The pseudo labelling improves the performance of the classification. It extracts the keywords from the tweets with high precision. The results reveal that using the DBN classifier in conjunction with the bigram in the N-gram model outperformed other models by 90.3 percent. The proposed approach can also aid medical professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action for each location based on their views regarding the pandemic. © 2022 Jatla Srikanth et al.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 spread across China and other countries in a matter of weeks. Yet, it is uncertain how people have responded to protective behaviours in this pandemic. This study aims to evaluate how trust in different types of information sources influences the intention to adopt protective behaviours. Methods: In total, 122 Chinese completed a survey on Qualtrics in March 2021. Data on demographic information, protective behaviours, trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived risk, worry and social desirability were collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify associations between these variables. Results: Trust in formal information was significantly associated with perceived risk (β = −.18) and significantly and positively associated with worry (β =.28). Trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with perceived risk (β =.57). Subsequently, perceived risk was significantly associated with social distancing (β = −.17), and worry was significantly and positively associated with mask wearing (β =.25) and significantly associated with hand washing (β = −.27). Trust in formal information was significantly and positively associated with hand washing (β =.26) while trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with social distancing and hand washing (β =.26). Perceived risk was significantly and positively associated with worry (β =.32). Conclusion: People who trust in informal information from social media and interpersonal communication would be more likely to adopt mask wearing and hand washing protective behaviours. People who trust in formal information from government-agency source would have a lower perceived risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to adopt social distancing, but people who trust in formal information have a greater worry about contracting COVID-19 and are more likely to wear masks. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have limited outdoor activities for many people, including university students who live inside the campus and far from their families. We investigated if and how the fear of COVID-19 had impacted visiting green areas and consequently the quality of life. Methods: The assessments were taken through a questionnaire-based survey of the university students living inside the campus in two universities (Konkuk and Sejong universities) in Seoul, South Korea in 2021 (n=255). Measuring three variables, the participants were asked to self-estimate their fear of COVID-19 and quality of life during the pandemic, and the time and frequency of the park visit. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to explore the potential relationship between the three main observed variables. Results: In the case of the campus students, visiting the green area cannot play a mediating impact on the effect of the COVID-19 fear and quality of life. Likewise, the data did not support the effect of COVID-19 fear on the quality of life for this group of students, however, significant correlations were found between the COVID-19fear and visiting green spaces (P<0.05) (positive effect on visiting, and negative effect on the time of visit). Conclusion: Students perceived not a considerable improvement in their quality of life after visiting green areas. It might be due to the fear of staying outdoor for a long time (frequency) during the pandemic, and students’ lifestyles. However, the quality of life for the students is likely to be influenced by other factors, rather than the fear of COVID-19. © 2022 Choi et al. Published by Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - During unusual times involving discontinued face to face sessions in formal education settings, mobile learning (m-learning) involving social networking sites has become a popular alternative since students are always in possession of handheld electronic devices. When connection through technology was the only option due to social distancing in current pandemic, students who were already active extensive users of social networks found online learning as a new way of getting formal education. The objective of this study was to explore how the state of student’s behavioral intention for social media based online learning is driven by external factors like subjective norm and self-efficacy. To fulfill this aim, this study uses a quantitative approach to study the factors that mediate the decision behavior of students towards social media employed as a learning platform and use of m-learning involving social networks. A sample of management science students (n= 255) from four universities participated in the research. Analysis of data suggested that subjective norm and self-efficacy were significant predictors for student participation in e-learning initiatives involving social media and networks. The proposed serial mediation model revealed that self-efficacy and perceived usefulness in that order were playing a positive significant role in student use of social networking for learning. No significant differences were observed between either gender when self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and use of social media in education were considered. © 2022

AB  - This research was designed to depict the process of generating approach behaviours for Korean and US residents for Muslim travellers. Through a quantitative procedure, the built frameworks explicated a sufficient amount of the variance in attitude, emotions and approach behaviours. Benefit perception, Islamic knowledge, social norm, image and Islamophobia were essential components of the developed frameworks. The mediating nature of resident attitude and emotions were evident. The Islamic knowledge and attitude relation and the emotion and approach behaviour relation differed across Korean and US residents. The comparative importance of resident attitude in developing approach behaviours was uncovered in both groups. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Western countries have witnessed increased hostility towards Muslims among individuals, and structurally in the ways that the media covers stories related to Islam/Muslims and in policies that infringe on the rights of Muslim communities. In response, practitioners have created media interventions that aim to reduce Islamophobia. However, it is unclear what causal effects these interventions have on reducing Islamophobia. Here, we test the effects of 11 media interventions developed by practitioners with an intervention tournament among U.S. samples. In Study 1, we identified three videos that most effectively reduced Islamophobia both immediately after watching and 1 month later. In Studies 2–4, we examined the psychological mechanisms of these successful videos and found an indirect effect of the interventions on reduced support for anti-Muslim policies through recognition of media bias against Muslims. This research highlights that drawing attention to structural biases, including biased media coverage of Muslims, is one potential strategy for ameliorating Islamophobia. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the first half of the 21st century, it is clear that racism and prejudice are prevalent worldwide and begin in childhood—as children can be perpetrators, victims, and bystanders of racism and prejudice. Reducing racism in youth is a critical step toward improving the society we all live in. This special issue reviews and synthesizes the latest research on racism and prejudice in childhood and adolescence, examining the role of families, schools, media, and friendships in reducing prejudice in youth and highlighting how to enhance collective well-being. By focusing on research over the past two decades, and including a range of international perspectives, this special section helps make theoretical, conceptual, and methodological advances on the topic of reducing and protecting children from racism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target - how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group - as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Social distancing including lockdowns are acceptable measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross sectional study, we surveyed the impact of these measurements on sexual behavior and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) use among MSM. A digital questionnaire was distributed via social media and geographically based meeting applications after the first lockdown (March–April 2020). 1194 MSM responded, 91.8% were HIV negative, 19.4% of them used PrEP regularly, and 8.2% were people living with HIV (PLWH). Median age was 34.5 years. 54.4% reported that they kept strictly social distancing guidelines. Low education, hazardous sexual behavior, moderate/severe, and depression predicted low compliance with social distancing guidelines. 66.7% reported a significant decrease in the number of casual sex partners. 55% of those who took PrEP reduced their PrEP intake. Many of the PLWH and PrEP users reduced their medical follow-up. In light of the continuous outbreak and the risk of further outbreaks in the future consideration should be given to provide continuing access to HIV and sexual health clinics. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study integrates the norm activation model with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to explore the impacts of personal norms (perceived environmental responsibility and environmental concern) on Vietnamese consumers’ green purchase intention. A dataset of 626 consumers was collected using the mall-intercept survey approach in the largest cities in Northern Vietnam. Structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed hypotheses, and the PROCESS approach was used to estimate indirect associations between hypothesized constructs. The findings indicated that both attitude toward green products and perceived behavioural control were strongly and positively associated with green purchase intention; however, no directly significant correlation was found between subjective norms and intention to engage in environment-friendly consumption. Regarding perceived environmental responsibility, a positive attitude toward green products was not directly related to perceived behavioural control and green purchase intention. Environmental concern was found to have a dramatic impact on green product attitude, perceived behavioural control, and green purchase intention. Notably, attitude toward green products significantly mediated the effects of subjective norms, perceived environmental responsibility, and environmental concern on green purchase intention, whereas perceived behavioural control also significantly mediated the impact of subjective norms and environmental concern on green purchase intention. This study enriches our understanding of the impact of perceived environmental responsibility and environmental concern on three motivational antecedents of the TPB and intention to engage in green consumption behaviour, providing some relevant recommendations for managerial and marketing practitioners to encourage sustainable consumption behaviours and motivate corporate environmental responsibility. © 2022 Management Development Institute.

AB  - Utilizing a longitudinal, observational study, grocery store health and safety controls implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic across stores in two cities were characterized. Sixteen stores between Seattle, WA (n = 9) and Portland, OR (n = 7) were visited monthly by the study team from May 2020 to January 2021, and observations of controls were recorded using a standardized checklist in REDCap. The checklist included questions on the presence or absence of controls such as physical barriers, social distancing markers, required masking of customers, cleaning of check-out stands, and closures of store areas. Descriptive analyses were conducted to determine the proportion of stores with a certain control each month. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to explore how controls changed over time, and whether differences were observed between cities or by income of the area the store serves. Source control (e.g., mask requirements) and engineering controls (e.g., physical barriers at checkout) were the most common and consistent controls observed across stores and over the study period. Controls such as having special hours for vulnerable populations, demarcations on aisles for directionality, and cleaning check-out stands between customers varied significantly over time (p < 0.05 in the mixed-effects model). Having an employee present to clean baskets and carts, as well as physical barriers between self-checkouts, were significantly more common in stores in areas above the median income (p < 0.05 in the mixed-effects model). To best protect workers and shoppers from infectious agents, controls should be evidence-based, consistently implemented across grocery stores, and coupled with administrative practices and policies to promote worker wellbeing. © 2022 JOEH, LLC.

AB  - The Uyghur people of China's far west are at the centre of a propaganda war between the United States and China. Western media claims about their treatment may well be exaggerated, but the oppression of the Uyghurs is real. In linking its actions to the war on terror, China has created an increasingly violent spiral of repression and resistance. The United States is cynically using this to justify measures that are really about economic competition. Freedom for the Uyghurs can only come as part of a China-wide movement for change. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Individuals who are strongly oriented towards market-based values are more likely to devalue groups identified as ”unprofitable” from an economic point of view. Drawing on insights from Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), this study explores economically legitimized prejudice in light of a far-reaching economization of the institu-tional and cultural structure. Multilevel models using data from the European Social Survey (2018) show that hostility towards immigrants is expressed more among individuals who strongly embrace market-based values and in countries where the institutional structure is dominated by the economy and non-economic social institutions are enfeebled (institutional imbalance). Aggregated market-based values (a “marketized anomic culture”) mediate the effect of a) individual market-based values and b) institutional imbalance on anti-immigrant atti-tudes. This study contributes to a better understanding of group prejudice under conditions of economization. It shows that applying IAT within a multilevel framework offers a fruitful explanation not only for crime but for other sociological phenomena. © 2022, Universitaet Bielefeld. All rights reserved.

AB  - Conflicts over formal and informal mosques constitute one of the dimensions upon which patterns of Islamophobia are enacted and experienced. Fostered by discursive arrangements embodied in everyday encounters with difference, such conflicts affect Muslims’ access to the public city. This article advances two arguments. First, by understanding postsecular space through Doreen Massey’s [2005. For Space. London: Sage] concept of throwntogetherness—the coming together of a multiplicity of imaginative trajectories of inhabiting human and non-human worlds—it argues for the centrality of imagination in thinking geographically. The article maintains that to challenge Islamophobia’s embodied knowledge requires to challenge imagination, framed as the capacity of mediating discursive thought and sense-perception. Second, the article argues for a postsecular thinking that exceeds the search for consensual paths of interreligious cohabitation and instead looks to publicly negotiate conflicts by pluralising imagination, identities, aesthetics, city forms, and theologies. These arguments are illustrated in reference to the multidisciplinary participatory project, “Reimagining the Mosque, Opening the City”, I conceived and co-curated with Muslim and non-Muslim scholars and artists in Rome and Bologna, Italy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: A minority of all with alcohol use disorders seek treatment. In Denmark, a media campaign, “RESPEKT,” has been broadcast nationwide since 2015. The campaign is unique from an international perspective and aims to increase treatment-seeking. Similar interventions have, up until now, not been scientifically evaluated. Aim: To investigate campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking pre- and post the campaign period. Also, associations to demographic factors and year of campaign will be investigated. Method: Study design: Repeated cross-sectional study Participants: Adults aged 30–70 years, in total n = 9169. Data: Pre- and post the campaign period between 2017 and 2020, an online questionnaire was administered by a market research company. The questionnaire covered demographic data, campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking about treatment for alcohol use disorders. In addition, complete-case logistic regression was performed to model dichotomous outcomes, and odds ratios were calculated. Results: Campaign awareness varied between 8 and 40% over the different years. Understanding of the main message was high and received higher endorsements over the study period. A majority expressed positive attitudes toward the campaign and support for the main message regarding free treatment. However, very few self-reported seeking information about AUD treatment. Female sex was associated with higher awareness of the campaign, higher understanding and more positive attitudes toward the campaign. Conclusion: The campaign evoked positive attitudes and had an impact on increasing knowledge and changing attitudes. However, no effect on self-reported information seeking about treatment was found. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Lockdowns and social distancing measures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made remote participation a necessity for a wide range of social situations. This article examines one example: the abrupt transformation of the Finnish doctoral defence into a remote-access experience facilitated by video-conferencing technologies. The event is regularly centred on a formal public academic debate, rife with local academic ritual and ceremonial formality and firmly tied to the assumption of physical co-presence in the material space. Following the tradition of spatial conceptualisations of the digital, we draw inspiration from Henri Lefebvre’s theory on the production of space, particularly the analytical framework of the spatial triad, which enables regarding the doctoral defence as a social space made up of relations between things. As remote-access tools are introduced, new actants enter the field; the relations they mediate are affected, as is the social space that the relations constitute. This facilitates the examination of the effects that remote-access technologies have on conceiving, perceiving and living the doctoral defence, and ultimately on the social space as holistically understood. Our analysis is based on observations of remote-access defences and interviews with doctoral candidates who defended their doctoral theses remotely. Our findings highlight how the social space of the defence is both curtailed and broadened by remote-access technologies; some relations that make up space are narrowed while others stretch sufficiently to be included. As a result, the remote-access defence conceptually counts as the real thing in our material, but it remains unsatisfactory as an experience. This finding suggests how to mediate social space without reducing it: focusing on the lived experience and ensuring that it is not inadvertently distorted. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Restorative justice (RJ) is oriented to respond to crime in ways that would repair individual, relational, and social harm. This study examined the relationship between type of offense and public attitudes toward RJ, in addition to the psychological mechanisms undergirding this relationship. We examined a model of three offense types (sexual, violent, and property) and their differential effect on support for RJ. Moreover, we examined whether this relationship was mediated by incremental beliefs, i.e., that human character is malleable. We also explored two control variables previously found predictive of attitudes toward punishment: perceived seriousness of the offense and fear of crime. Participants (N = 608) read a definition of one offense and completed a survey regarding incremental beliefs, fear of crime, perceived seriousness of the offense, and support for RJ. The findings indicated main effects of offense type on attitudes toward RJ. Additionally, differences between offense types were found in incremental beliefs and attitudes toward RJ, such that for both variables, sexual offenses were rated the lowest followed by violent and property offenses. An indirect effect of offense type on attitudes toward RJ through incremental beliefs was also found, but not through fear of crime or perceived seriousness. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Bisexual individuals are invisible sexual minorities, who face prejudice and “double discrimination” from both heterosexual and sexual minority communities. Despite this, little empirical research has examined bisexual prejudice reduction. To address this, the current study tested an E-contact intervention–a highly structured, text-based, online interaction tool–to reduce bisexual prejudice. Heterosexual participants (N = 170) were randomly allocated to an intergroup (E-contact) or intragroup (control) interaction, with either a male or female interaction partner. Findings indicated that intergroup E-contact resulted in less intergroup anxiety compared to an intragroup interaction, and that this effect was more pronounced when the bisexual interaction partner was male for heterosexual men, but not for heterosexual women. Although E-contact had no direct effect on tolerance toward bisexual individuals or the perceived stability of bisexuality as a sexual orientation, findings revealed that reduced intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of E-contact on these outcome variables. This result was found in the intergroup dynamic of heterosexual men interacting with bisexual men, providing an important experimental demonstration of the potential for harnessing an E-contact intervention to reduce affective prejudice toward bisexual individuals. © 2022 The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.

AB  - This research focuses on what users know about search engine optimization (SEO) and how well they can identify results that have potentially been influenced by SEO. We conducted an online survey with a sample representative of the German online population (N = 2,012). We found that 43% of users assume a better ranking can be achieved without paying money to Google. This is in stark contrast to the possibility of influence through paid advertisements, which 79% of internet users are aware of. However, only 29.2% know how ads differ from organic results. The term ‘search engine optimization’ is known to 8.9% of users but 14.5% can correctly name at least one SEO tactic. Success in labelling results that can be influenced through SEO varies by search engine result page (SERP) complexity and devices: participants achieved higher success rates on SERPs with simple structures than on the more complex SERPs. SEO results were identified better on the small screen than on the large screen. 59.2% assumed that SEO has a (very) strong impact on rankings. SEO is more often perceived as positive (75.2%) than negative (68.4%). The insights from this study have implications for search engine providers, regulators, and information literacy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Collectivism has been identified as a protective factor against COVID-19–perhaps due to increased conformity with social norms regarding prevention behaviors. Other studies have also found that individualism can inspire uptake of preventative behaviors as a means of personal protection. It is possible that these cultural orientations may promote different patterns of prevention (e.g. mask wearing vs. social distancing). Furthermore, existing studies examining the role of individualism and collectivism during the COVID-19 pandemic have frequently failed to account for other psychological processes, including differences in personality, which could help provide a better understanding of the psychological process underlying prevention behavior. Methods: Participants were recruited using social media advertisements. The Cultural Orientations Scale measured individualism–collectivism and hierarchism-egalitarianism. The Ten Item Personality Inventory measured the five factor model of personality. Multivariable models, dominance analyses and structural equation mediation tests were used to identify the most important predictors of COVID-19 prevention behavior (i.e. mask-wearing, hand-washing, reducing social interactions, physical distancing, staying at home and social bubbling), controlling for demographic and situational factors. Results: Among 774 participants, most (i.e. 60–80%) reported uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Higher vertical (hierarchical) collectivism was associated with staying at home and higher horizontal (egalitarian) individualism was associated with mask-wearing and reducing social interactions. Neither Vertical Collectivism nor Horizontal Collectivism were significantly associated with any of the prevention behaviors when controlling for personality traits and confounding variables. Agreeableness was identified as a key mediator of the correlation between these cultural orientations on general uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Conclusions: Cultural orientations (e.g. collectivism-individualism, hierarchism-egalitarianism) and personality traits (e.g. Agreeableness) are salient correlates of COVID-19 prevention behaviors and therefore should be accounted for in the development, design and delivery of health promotion messages aiming to increase uptake of these behaviors. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has a tradition for being among the most respected national police organisations globally. More recent political events in Hong Kong have however placed the HKPF in highly visible public order situations. A wide array of political factions have emerged as a consequence of the handover of control in Hong Kong, many of which have involved young people protesting the curtailment of democratic rights. In this paper, we utilise Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (n = 2075). We utilise Inglehart’s (1971. The silent revolution in Europe: intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. American political science review, 65 (4), 991–1017) concept of postmaterialism to examine how far young people’s more negative attitudes to the police can be underpinned by cohort-based (or generational) explanations. Our findings identify associations between postmaterialist values and lower confidence in the police. Those that favoured stricter immigration controls, experienced higher fear of crime, perceived drug selling in their area, and consumed certain types of media (notably television and new media) were also less likely to have confidence in the HKPF. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Frontline staff significantly impact a company's performance because their tasks involve direct contact with customers. This study aims to determine the effect of foreign supervisor support on Thai subordinates' perceptions of foreign colleague prejudice and job happiness. The data was gathered from 358 Thai personnel in the air transport industry who work alongside international co-workers and managers. The data analysis technique employed was partial least square structural equation modelling. The findings corroborated the beneficial association between foreign supervisor support and job satisfaction among Thai subordinates. Furthermore, the negative effect of foreign supervisor support on Thai subordinates' perceived prejudice towards foreign coworkers was more significant for Thai subordinates with a more extended job duration. Additionally, perceived prejudice against foreign co-workers was found to partially moderate the effect of foreign supervisor support on the job satisfaction of Thai subordinates. The findings add to the body of empirical research about supervisor support across ethnic groups. Additionally, this study makes practical recommendations to businesses that hire foreign nationals, particularly as frontline personnel. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Societally salient issues, like migration, stimulate user engagement with political parties on social media. This user engagement, in turn, is associated with political behavior, such as voting. Nonetheless, few studies so far have investigated the interaction between these factors. We examine how anti-immigration attitudes are associated with user engagement with political parties on social media. In this study, user engagement is understood as following political parties on social media. Through online data that were collected in October 2019 among adults (N= 1,000) in Belgium, we investigate how attitudes and user engagement are associated with voting behavior. Results suggest that attitudes towards migration are associated with user engagement with both left and right-wing parties on social media. Moreover, these attitudes and user engagement - and the interaction between the two - are related to voting behavior: being against (being in favor of) migration and following right-wing (left-wing) parties on social media is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for a right-wing (left-wing) party. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.

AB  - Introduction: Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is common in clinical populations. Childhood maltreatment (CM) and attitudes both towards oneself and towards DSH may be of importance for the development of DSH. This study aimed to test whether patients with DSH report more CM, more negative attitudes towards oneself and more positive attitudes towards DSH than a clinical and a healthy comparison group, and whether the effects of CM are mediated by negative attitudes towards oneself. Method: Females with DSH and psychiatric disorders (n = 34), females without DSH but with psychiatric disorders (n = 31) and healthy female individuals (n = 29) were compared regarding DSH, CM, attitudes towards the self and attitudes towards self-harm. Results: Females with DSH reported more emotional abuse and more self-hatred as compared to both comparison groups. The effect of emotional abuse was mediated by self-hatred. The DSH-group had significantly more positive attitudes towards DSH than the healthy comparison group. Conclusion: Self-hatred and CM in the form of emotional abuse may be distinguishing characteristics of female patients with DSH in psychiatric settings. The present results are compatible with the hypothesis that emotional abuse leads to DSH via self-hatred, but the cross-sectional nature of the study precludes any causal conclusions. The clinical utility of the results is discussed. © 2022 The Authors. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Bot Detection is crucial in a world where Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a pivotal role in our lives as public communication channels. This task becomes highly relevant in crises like the Covid-19 pandemic when there is a growing risk of proliferation of automated accounts designed to produce misinformation content. To address this issue, we first introduce a comparison between supervised Bot Detection models using Data Selection. The techniques used to develop the bot detection models use features such as the tweets’ metadata or accounts’ Digital Fingerprint. The techniques implemented in this work proved effective in detecting bots with different behaviors. Social Fingerprint-based methods have been found to be effective with bots that behave in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, all these approaches have produced excellent results compared to the Botometer v3. Second, we present and discuss a case study related to the Covid-19 pandemic that analyses the differences in the discourse between bots and humans on Twitter, a platform used worldwide to express opinions and engage in dialogue in a public arena. While bots and humans generally express themselves alike, the tweets’ content and sentiment analysis reveal some dissimilitudes, especially in tweets concerning President Trump. When the discourse switches to pandemic management by Trump, sentiment-related values display a drastic difference, showing that tweets generated by bots have a predominantly negative attitude. However, according to our findings, while automated accounts are numerous and active in discussing controversial issues, they usually do not seem to increase exposure to negative and inflammatory content for human users. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The public and political debate about immigration now play a big role in all European elections, and there is a trend increasing an anti-immigrant sentiment that receives important media attention. This work, based on the European Social Survey (ESS) round 9 data for 27 European countries, contributes to such debate by introducing a new method in the field, a Fuzzy-Hybrid Approach (FHA), that complements other methodological methods that have been used to measure citizens’ attitudes towards immigrants. The novel approach in the field provides a synthetic indicator that measures openness towards immigrants (OTISI). Then, we analyse the relationship that exists between some specific sociodemographic variables and the new index. Results show that country, political orientation, age, religion, economic situation, gender, birthplace, employment, education, universalism, and conformity are key drivers that explain different attitudes towards immigrants. Our findings concur with other previous studies showing that the results are robust and that the method can be applied in future social science studies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The new media data interaction system has profound influences on the teaching efficiency of vocational education. Therefore, its effects on the teaching efficiency of vocational education were analyzed in this study. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the satisfaction of students with the application of the new media data interaction system in their vocational education and teaching practices. According to scale statistics and the multi-grade fuzzy satisfaction calculation model, results reveal that students are relatively satisfied with the services provided by the new media data interaction system and its effects on teaching efficiency, thereby indicating that such teaching mode can lead to good teaching efficiency. These students also have relatively positive attitudes toward teaching activities based on the new media data interaction system, and this teaching mode can improve their academic performance in vocational education, hence achieving good teaching efficiency. Students of classes that use the new media data interaction system also report higher learning efficiency compared with those students in classes that do not use this system. © 2022, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

AB  - How do cultural norms, ideologies, and beliefs shape public opinion and media framing of race-based athletic activism? This paper uses media coverage of and commentary on the 1968 American ‘revolt of the Black athlete’ to explicate the deep cultural structures that help explain both support and opposition. The paper begins with a brief, schematic overview of the proposal for a Black Olympic boycott that was the centrepiece of 1968 organising and how it was reported by sports journalists and in the mainstream media. The second section identifies the reasons American reporters were, on the whole, so opposed to the proposed boycott: the inherent lack of support for the athletes’ racial change agenda and the far-more-familiar arguments that sports were not the proper venue for activism. The third section argues that a whole constellation of cultural norms and beliefs—about sport culture, colour-blind visions of racial justice, and liberal democratic ideals about politics and social change—coalesced to make race-based sport protest appear both unnecessary and inappropriate. The conclusion summarises the implications for understanding both public reception of and media responses to contemporary, race-based athletic activism as well as for tracking institutional changes and cultural shifts unfolding in the Black Lives Matter era. © 2022 The British Society of Sports History.

AB  - Though there is evidence of an historical exclusion of trans women from lesbian feminist separatist spaces supported by radical feminist lesbian anti-trans discourse as well as modern examples of anti-trans perspectives promoted by feminists sometimes described as Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists, it remains unclear as to if there is a significant association between being a lesbian cis woman feminist and harboring negative attitudes toward trans women or alternatively, if the recent proliferation of exclusionary tactics directed toward trans women’s rights (especially via social media) has been the result of loud voices among a minority who have been successful anti-trans mouthpieces as of late. The current study utilizes survey data (N = 1461 cis women; n = 331 lesbian cis women) to investigate the following research questions: (1) do lesbian cis women feminists express greater levels of negativity toward trans women than other cis women (heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual) do? and (2) is there a relationship between feminist identity among lesbian cis women and the stigmatization of trans women (as undeserving of rights, as incapable parents/mothers, as excluded from the military, and as sexually problematic)? Results provide ample evidence of anti-trans perspectives among some lesbian cis women feminists. Overall, the findings provide a starting point to begin to understand how to dismantle the complexities embedded in the relationships between feminism, lesbian identity, and trans negativity and work toward a trans-inclusive future of feminism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach: Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings: The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications: When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value: Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate through free word association the perception of Brazilian consumers regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. One thousand individuals answered the questionnaire via an online platform. Most cited terms (hygiene—8%, fear—8%, caution—5%) and categories (negative attitudes and feeling—72% and sanitization—60%) were related to overall COVID-19 infection rather than their specific infection through the food. The perception of the possibility of risk of this type of cross-contamination was greater for male participants, within the food field, with high income (>10 minimum wages), and from the midwest region. Nonetheless, there are still doubts regarding this possibility, especially for participants with low income (≤10 minimum wages), females, higher education (≥secondary school), who exercise professional activity outside the food sector and from most regions of Brazil. Practical applications: Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered 2 years ago, the emergence of new variants such as Omicron has increased infection and mortality rates worldwide. A possible way of COVID-19 infection is cross-contamination through food handling and contact surfaces if preventive measures are not applied. In this context, understanding the consumer perception from a continental-size country such as Brazil, with a wide variety of socioeconomic profiles, is crucial to minimize the severe impacts of the pandemic. Our study demonstrates the need to disseminate scientific information in different media to reduce misinformation, especially social media because most Brazilian consumers had doubts and uncertainties about the possibility of COVID-19 infection from cross-contamination through food. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Research Summary: This study examines how incumbent director reactions to media coverage of the #MeToo movement have impacted the evaluation of prospective corporate directors. We argue that heightened intergroup anxiety related to male–female interactions leads incumbents to seize on social attributes that bolster category-based trust in the reliability of prospective directors' interpersonal behavior. We predict that in response to #MeToo coverage, incumbents evaluate board candidates more positively when they share demographic characteristics or have prior social connections, and these effects are strengthened when incumbents socially identify with the firm. Empirical analyses using a longitudinal survey of evaluations of director candidates support these predictions. Our findings suggest how social movements can produce unintended consequences by inadvertently triggering psychological processes that partially offset the anticipated benefits of the movement. Managerial Summary: Increased coverage of #MeToo has heightened concerns among board members about male–female interactions on the board. Our study finds that as #MeToo coverage increases, incumbent directors evaluate potential board candidates more positively to the extent that they share demographic characteristics, including gender, race, functional background, education and age, or when they are connected through the social network of board appointments. These effects are especially pronounced for incumbents who psychologically identify with the firm, meaning that their self-concept is aligned with features of the organization. Our study suggests how psychological reactions of corporate directors to #MeToo may inadvertently reduce board diversity and overall board effectiveness, and we call for research-based interventions to correct this unfortunate side effect of a critically important social justice movement. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is commonly undertreated. Physicians cite discomfort with AUD medication as a barrier to treatment. While several curricula teach and assess screening and brief interventions, few teach and assess learner knowledge of treatment options. Methods: We created a video- and case-based curriculum for internal medicine residents delivered by 16 internal medicine faculty in three 30-minute sessions at four clinic sites. Learner knowledge, attitudes, and confidence were assessed before and after the curriculum. We used qualitative methods to evaluate learner reflections. We also assessed faculty satisfaction with the curriculum. Results: Of 153 residents receiving the curriculum, 35 (23%) completed both pre- and postsurveys. Median percent correct on knowledge questions improved from 67% pre- to 80% postcurriculum (p < .001). Confidence increased for all three items assessing it, with a notable increase in confidence with pharmacotherapy (2.9 pre- vs. 4.5 postcurriculum on a 7-point Likert scale with high scores indicating greater confidence, p < .001). Positive attitudes toward people with AUD increased from 3.4 pre- to 3.9 postcurriculum (p < .001) on a 7-point Likert scale. Learners continued to express concerns about prescribing logistics, the role of primary care, and management of ongoing use. Thirteen of 16 faculty (83%) completed the postcurricular survey; all said they would be happy to facilitate again. Discussion: Implementation of this curriculum for the management of AUD improved resident knowledge, attitudes, and confidence in AUD treatment. The curriculum was acceptable to faculty and is ideal for programs looking to expand teaching about AUD. © 2022 Spinella et al.

AB  - Background: The use of herbal medicine is increasing globally, particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia, yet little is known regarding its effect and safety during pregnancy. Pregnant women prefer herbal medicine due to easy accessibility, traditional and cultural beliefs, and comparatively low cost. This study aimed to assess women’s knowledge and attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy and associated factors among women who gave birth in the last twelve months in Dega Damot district. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1st to February 30th, 2021. A total of 872 women were selected using a stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was done and a p-value of ≤ 0.05 was used to declare the level of significance. Results: Women’s knowledge and positive attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy was 49.1% (95% CI: 46–52) and 57.3% (95% CI: 54–61), respectively. Access to media, had antenatal care visit, being urban dweller, history of herbal medicine usage, and a short distance to reach the nearby health facility were significantly associated with women’s knowledge about effects of herbal medicine usage. Besides, being primiparous and short traveling time to reach the nearby health facility was significantly associated with women’s attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy. Conclusion: Women’s knowledge and positive attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy was low. It is important to design strategies to improve the accessibilities of maternal health services, and expand access to media will have a great role in improving women’s knowledge and attitude towards herbal medicine usage during pregnancy. © 2022 AlemuAnteneh et al.

AB  - Objectives: Since 2009 the number of unvaccinated children in Poland has been regularly increasing. The purpose of the study was to learn what parents who decide to vaccinate their children feel and believe about their children’s vaccines and in particular to find out how these sentiments and beliefs affect their attitude and decision-making with reference to vaccinations. Methods: The interviews were conducted during an immunization visit of parents whose children are covered by immunization schedule; 53 parents aged 23 to 48 years took part in the study. Most study participants were high school or university graduates living in rural areas. Children were 1 week to 5 years old. Thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data. Results: Identified factors shaping the parents’ positive attitude to vaccination included conviction of necessity of vaccines (effective disease prevention, safety, favourable benefit-to-risk ratio, and concerns about the child). The general anti-vaccination belief was that vaccines are unnecessary. External factors, mainly authority figures and media broadcasts, affect parents’ beliefs and decisions. Conclusions: Various factors affect parents’ decision concerning immunization of their children. Both compulsory and recommended vaccines should be provided free-of-charge. Choice overload should be reduced. Paediatricians should address parental vaccine hesitancy. © 2022, Czech National Institute of Public Health. All rights reserved.

AB  - The role of young people in the virtual world tends to be an all-consuming one. Indeed, they play a role as actors in various aspects of the digital age. This study therefore sought to analyze the construction of religious messages related to doctrine, religious practice, and identity politics. Methodologically, this study implemented ethnomedia for young people who upload content to social media, specifically Instagram. The practice of religious deconstruction was explored through a multimodal analysis of the content these people share on Instagram. The findings of this study reveal how young people, as actors, produce items of content that are interrelated. The religious practices of these young people potentially trigger resistance to being moderate due to the seemingly infinite range of online religious sources. Online-mediated religious understanding, however, cannot be fully understood through the reductionist lens of binary opposites, such as moderates and radicals or positive and negative attitudes. This article illustrates that young people’s experiences without guidance and emotional expression online are affected more than by their knowledge and abilities of the digital world, and that their attitudes and the interrelated complexities need to be considered. © 2022, Association for Social Studies Educa.

AB  - A profound political tension between Turkey and Germany has gained an overall dimension on the political agenda of the intra-European migration discussion since 2016. As close trade partners, Turkey and Germany became gradually political adversaries on different issues. 2016 and the following years marked a turnover in the already worsened mutual relations. A series of political issues such as recognising the Armenian genocide in 1915, open allegations and critical views against the Turkish President and prohibition of election campaigns for Turkish government politicians in Germany had driven political relations between the two countries to nadir. This obscure situation led the Turks of Germany (The phrases “Turks of Germany” or “Turkish migrants” are persons with migration background from Turkey who still bear Turkish citizenship or formerly were Turkish citizens. This group's ethnic or confessional identity is not recognised; their legal status and country of origin are preponderant.), who have close ties to their ancestors’ homeland and consider Germany as the centre of their lives, nolens volens into a limbo situation. Within the “guest-worker program” framework in the second part of the 20th century, highly industrialised countries of Western Europe recruited migrant workers from different countries. This workforce should perform mostly blue-collar labour in the receiving countries. After six decades of Turkish presence in Germany, the grandsons and granddaughters of the former guest workers are well-represented in almost every sector of the society. However, their loyalty and integrability to the receiving country are challenged by German politics, especially by the governments of conservative chancellor Angela Merkel (2005–2021). If Turks of Germany feel closely connected to Turkey and Turkish culture (Workers from Turkey brought with them to the country of immigration their own “cultural assets”. Those are, language, religious and customary beliefs, social habits, dress, music, literature, social codes and manners, shared history, food, etc. However, migrants in the receiving country undergo a process of hybridity under the influence of the new cultural environment. (Please see: Bhabha [The location of culture, New York, NY: Routledge, 1994]) Culture within the framework of post-colonialism has also been discussed in Edward W. Said's book “Culture and Imperialism” (Said [Kültür ve Emperyalizm. Kapsamlı Bir Düşünsel ve Siyasal Sorgulama Çalışması. Hil Yayın: İstanbul, 1998]). If Turks of Germany feel closely connected to Turkey and Turkish culture, they are not recognised as integrable members of the society. Identity-based and culture-oriented policies inexorably influence the willingness of migrants to feel like equal members in the host society, and it applies even to the new generations with migration backgrounds. The question of migrant integration is the most emotionally debated issue in Germany and seems to be the greatest challenge in the political agenda. Beyond the bilateral Turkish–German issues, the growing xenophobic sentiments, islamophobia and Europe-wide political populism may cause a persistent bilateral tension in the medium term between the countries and among the transnational and native communities. Anti-Turkish rhetoric in the media alienates the Turkish community and has a value to jeopardise integration efforts more and more. © 2022 The Authors. International Migration © 2022 IOM.

AB  - Purpose: Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for stroke. However, to encourage physical activity after stroke, it is important to know what motivates the patients. We aimed to explore possible motivators and barriers for physical activity in patients discharged after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Methods: A qualitative study including 35 patients (21 men) with minor stroke or TIA (median age; 69 years, range 47–90) in semi-structured focus group interviews. Audio recordings were transcribed to text verbatim and analyzed with qualitative content analysis. Results: Six interviews of 60 min. revealed five categories; the patients had a positive attitude towards physical activity, and they preferred to exercise locally under supervision of health professionals. Physical activity with others was motivating and obligating, and if possible as a weekly habit. Some experienced physical- and mental sequelae, which kept them from exercising. Conclusion: This study provides valuable knowledge of what motivates and prevents patients with minor stroke or TIA to be physically active after hospital discharge, and what to consider when designing future exercise studies. Consequently, it is recommended that patients with minor stroke or TIA are offered supervised physical activity to prevent worsening of cardiovascular disease and recurrent cardiovascular event.Implications for rehabilitation Participants were positive towards physical activity after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Physical activity with others was perceived as both motivating and obligating. Post-stroke fatigue, lack of energy, and overview should be considered when designing secondary prevention programs. Participants call for exercise opportunities arranged locally and as group exercise supervised by health professionals with knowledge of stroke. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Older adults can frequently serve as a reminder of death to younger adults. People can develop a negative attitude towards aging and elderliness because they see old age as an obstacle in reaching their goals and what they want to do, which they see as the purpose of their lives. This research was conducted to answer to the question of whether attitudes towards aging and elderliness have a mediating role in the relationship between meaning and purpose of life and death anxiety. Relational screening model was used in the research. The research was conducted with 422 participants between the ages of 18-59. In the analysis of the data, Pearson Correlation Analysis and Regression analysis were performed. In addition, Hayes Macro was used in SPSS program to analyze the mediator variable effect. As a result, it was determined that the attitude towards aging had a significant mediator role in the effect of the meaning and purpose of life on death anxiety. It was found that there was a moderate positive correlation between the attitude towards aging and elderliness and death anxiety, a moderate negative correlation between the attitude towards aging and elderliness and the meaning and purpose of life, and a weak negative correlation between death anxiety and the meaning and purpose of life. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Surveys of Americans’ views on the Zika virus allowed tests of overlapping but distinctive models of how culture affects risk responses: (1) a model inspired by the “solution aversion” (SA) hypothesis, which posits that cultural attitudes lower perceived risk when mediated by negative attitudes toward a hazard management option, and (2) the Affect Heuristic-Cultural Cognition Theory (AH-CCT) model, which posits that cultural biases can alter varied risk responses mediated by affect about the risk source or hazard. Dependent variables were personal and U.S. risk perceptions, judged need for U.S. action against Zika, and support for potential or actual Zika management options. Both models were supported, but the SA-based model (using value threat evoked by a management option as the affect mediator) was stronger overall and applied more to need and support judgments, while AH-CCT (using affect aroused by Zika as mediator) applied more to amplifying perceived risk. These results underline the value of parallel testing of models with multiple candidate measures of a limited number of concepts to enhance scientific understanding of factors affecting risk responses. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The existing literature postulates that individual-level attitudes toward immigration are partly determined via the effect of immigration on the labor market. In particular, the labor market competition hypothesis states that natives should oppose immigrants with similar qualifications because they threaten their jobs. Empirical findings, however, partly contradict this expectation. In this paper, we argue that one needs to evaluate immigration attitudes in a broader context since the impact of immigration should be mediated by actual job market competition. In industrialized countries, the arrival of high-skilled immigrants happens against a background in which economic globalization positively affects the demand for high-skilled labor. Thus, the influx of high-skilled immigrants should rarely increase job market competition. The opposite occurs for low-skilled workers, for which labor market insecurity is enhanced by both economic globalization and immigration. We find some support for our argument using micro-level data from 19 European countries. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background. One of the greatest inventions of the 21st century is the development of vaccines against the life-threatening pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whenever a new medication or treatment modality is introduced globally, it is accompanied by anxiety in the general public and among health care professionals. Objectives. The aim of the study was to explore factors that may influence the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among dental health care professionals, as they are the first subgroup in the population to receive the vaccine. Material and methods. A survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 164 health care professionals (general dentists, dental specialists with 2 years of experience after graduation and dental as-sistants). Data was collected by sending a URL link to the hard-and soft-copy questionnaire on Google Forms through all social media platforms. The questionnaire had 2 sections – the 1st part concerned the demographic details and the 2nd part was designed to assess the acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among dental health care professionals and the related factors. The normality of the data was assessed with the Shapiro–Wilk test. The Cox regression algorithm was applied to evaluate the factors associated with the acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Results. Out of 164 participants, 85.37% showed a positive attitude toward vaccination and only 7.32% of dental health care professionals were not willing to get vaccinated; out of them, 5 were males and 7 were females. Those who refused to get vaccinated included 3.6% of general dentists, 21.1% of dental specialists and 11.7% of dental assistants. The complications of major concern were fever, myalgia and the lethargic condition immediately after vaccination. Conclusions. A small percentage of health care professionals declined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the main reason was uncertainty about the associated side effects. The respondents were mostly concerned about such side effects as fever, myalgia and the lethargic condition immediately after vaccination. © 2022 by Wroclaw Medical University.

AB  - The rapid spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants combined with slowing pace of vaccination in Fall 2021 created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic in King County, Washington, USA. We analyzed the benefits of offering vaccination to children ages 5- 11 and expanding the overall vaccination coverage using mathematical modeling. We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to simulate scenarios of vaccinating children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. Dynamic social distancing was implemented in response to changes in weekly hospitalizations. Reduction of hospitalizations and estimated time under additional social distancing measures are reported over the 2021-2022 school year. In the scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI was predicted to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations cutting youth hospitalizations in half compared to no vaccination and largely reducing the need for additional social distancing measures over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage was reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations would be averted and the need for increased social distancing would almost certainly be avoided. Our work suggests that uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County was partly possible because reasonable precaution measures were taken at schools to reduce infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children provides meaningful reduction of the COVID-19 health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. It remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with future epidemic waves. © 2022 the Author(s).

AB  - In the past three decades, email has become one of the most widely used forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in student-professor interactions in the academic context. In particular, language use in email writing by English as a foreign language (EFL) learners has been studied extensively. This research investigates the students’ perceptions of email communication and the social factors which are perceived as influential to email communication. In this study, we implemented a questionnaire and focus-group interviews. Two-hundred and one Taiwanese EFL learners from a university located in central Taiwan were recruited for the questionnaire, and 20 learners were selected from the larger group to participate in the interviews. The questionnaire investigated the students’ perceptions of email usage and their evaluation of emails. The interviews, on the other hand, were conducted to gather in-depth information. The findings from both the questionnaire and interviews indicated that the students tended to recognize the university context and email medium as formal. Furthermore, power asymmetry in the student-professor relationship played a more important role than social distance, which led to a choice of formal language style in the email correspondences. However, despite the fact that the students recognized email as a formal medium of communication and called for a formal style of language, they did not seem to be equipped with sufficient pragmalinguistic resources to perform appropriate requests. Instruction is therefore suggested for EFL learners to conduct form-function-context mapping to achieve appropriateness. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to National Taiwan Normal University.

AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This research examines the relationship between populist thinking and global crisis-solving motivations concerning climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from five European countries (Switzerland, France, Finland, Greece, and Italy), we test a model where crisis-related science skepticism—understood as the defense of commonsense knowledge against scientific expertise—mediates the association between populist thinking and crisis-mitigation attitudes. The results show considerable convergence across national contexts. Relative deprivation predicts endorsement of two core components of populism's thin ideology, people sovereignty and antielitism. These subdimensions of populism are linked to science skepticism, although variably across contexts. Science skepticism then leads to a lower sense of personal responsibility for climate change mitigation and to negative attitudes towards a governmental measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings further show that under specific conditions, the populist request for greater democratic participation may mobilize individuals to get involved in crisis mitigation. Overall, our results highlight the role of politicized common sense in motivating and justifying opposition to measures and policies based on scientific expertise. We conclude that science skepticism, rather than populism per se, explains cynical and dismissive attitudes towards global crises. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in academic teaching and dental education, but the impact on dental professors' mental health and quality of life remains poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of social distancing and online teaching related to COVID-19 on the quality of life and anxiety of Brazilian dental professors. This was a cross-sectional study conducted from August 2020 to October 2020. Three instruments were used in an online version: a questionnaire about personal data, academic information and online teaching activities, the Generalized Anxiety Disorders 7 (GAD7) scale, and the Abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-bref) scale. All instruments were sent by e-mail, social media, and messaging apps to private and public universities and professors. Of the 318 responses, 187 (58.8%) were from female professors. Moreover, lack of good internet access and adequate place for online teaching, difficulties in producing teaching materials, and housework roles had a significant impact on the quality of life and anxiety scores (all p-values < 0.05). Also, Brazilian dental professors who declared that they would make greater efforts if the activities were face-to-face had significantly worse quality of life and anxiety scores, and female professors had significantly higher anxiety scores (all p-values < 0.05). These results provide evidence of a negative effect of social distancing and online teaching activities related to COVID-19 outbreak on the health-related quality of life and mental health of Brazilian dental professors. © 2022.

AB  - Anti-tobacco propaganda media (Television, radio, print media and internet media) messages promote knowledge regarding the ill effect of tobacco on the human body as well as increase the negative attitude towards tobacco. However, their role in maintaining tobacco abstinence is not explored much. This review summarizes the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on the maintenance of tobacco abstinence; the influence of different types of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on tobacco users and non-users. Tobacco users and recent quitters are not benefiting from these anti-tobacco propaganda and media messages. The graphic pictorial warnings were found to have more influence over increasing knowledge, changing attitude, enhancing quit attempts, quit intentions, and motivation to quit. However, it is also noticed that these anti-tobacco propaganda media messages have a boomerang effect on tobacco users. These media propaganda messages sometimes act as a cue for tobacco users and make them relapse. Many studies in the past have shown that these media messages positively impact the quitting process but, again, remained significant to the first attempt only. Hence, these messages have not been found to be very effective in maintaining tobacco abstinence among tobacco users. The exposure and frequency of the anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages matter. Pro-tobacco advertisements can neutralize the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda messages. Although, anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages play a crucial role in modifying tobacco-related behaviour. © 2022 Universiti Putra Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to the residential self-selection hypothesis in transportation planning, individual characteristics centering on sociodemographics and attitudes have been conceptualized as antecedent confounders in the built environment–travel behavior relationship (and subsequently, the built environment as a mediator). In medical science, socio-ecological models have been used to designate the individual characteristics and built environment to mutually function as moderators. However, whether individual characteristics (built environment) assume the role of the antecedent (mediator), moderator, or control, has received scant scholarly attention. Using a structural equation model based on the total travel time data of Seoul, this study finds that, by mode of travel, sociodemographics work as moderators for automobile travel and attitudes as antecedents for nonmotorized travel. The sociodemographics/attitudes and built environment are likely to be significant only if their counterpart is also significant. Demographically, the compact built environment tends to reduce automobile travel only for older residents and those who live in larger households. Moreover, travelers with positive attitudes toward daily facilities may self-select into compact neighborhoods and subsequently increase nonmotorized travel. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to conduct a systematic review of economic evaluations of COVID-19 interventions and to examine whether and how these studies incorporate non-health impacts and distributional concerns. Methods: We searched the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Portfolio as of May 20, 2021, and supplemented our search with additional sources. We included original articles, including preprints, evaluating both the health and economic effects of a COVID-19–related intervention. Using a pre-specified data collection form, 2 reviewers independently screened, reviewed, and extracted information about the study characteristics, intervention types, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We used an Impact Inventory to catalog the types of non-health impacts considered. Results: We included 70 articles, almost half of which were preprints. Most articles (56%) included at least one non-health impact, but fewer (21%) incorporated non-economic consequences. Few articles (17%) examined subgroups of interest. After excluding negative ICERs, the median ICER for the entire sample (n = 243 ratios) was $67,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (interquartile range [IQR] $9000-$893,000/QALY). Interventions including a pharmaceutical component yielded a median ICER of $93,000/QALY (IQR $4000-$7,809,000/QALY), whereas interventions including a non-pharmaceutical component were slightly more cost-effective overall with a median ICER of $81,000/QALY (IQR $12,000-$1,034,000/QALY). Interventions reported to be highly cost-effective were treatment, public information campaigns, quarantining identified contacts/cases, canceling public events, and social distancing. Conclusions: Our review highlights the lack of consideration of non-health and distributional impacts among COVID-19–related economic evaluations. Accounting for non-health impacts and distributional effects is essential for comprehensive assessment of interventions’ value and imperative for generating cost-effectiveness evidence for both current and future pandemics. © 2022 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research, Inc.

AB  - Cemeteries are powerful spatial manifestations of belonging and integration for many marginalized communities, including Muslims in the west. This article examines attempts between 2007 and 2020 to establish Muslim cemeteries in four white, English-speaking, Christian-majority (WEC) countries, and the resulting backlash as a geographic form of Islamophobia. These countries are England, Scotland, Australia, and the United States. By drawing theoretically on the geographies of Muslim minorities, Islamic necrogeographies, and theories of Islamophobia and whiteness, we engage five case studies to provide a detailed examination of the Islamophobic objections to attempts to establish Muslim cemeteries. More specifically, we analyse the discursive strategies contained in the speech of hostile locals as presented in newspaper articles. Our analysis identifies a number of key themes mobilized by cemetery opponents to frame the burial sites as a threat to suburban or rural space, often in environmental terms. This preliminary transnational analysis seeks to begin a discussion of conflicts surrounding Muslim cemeteries and the geographic manifestations of Islamophobia in the context of normative WEC space in the rural and suburban English-speaking west. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - In 2018, the Australian Government adopted an ‘opt-out’ strategy to increase participation in My Health Record (MHR), the national digital patient record system. Opt out was rationalised through discourse on the universal right to health. Media controversy ensued due to privacy fears, security and commercial exploitation of patient information. LGBT community organisations warned that people with complex health needs should consider their privacy and legal situation when deciding whether or not to opt out of MHR. With reference to the health needs of sexuality and gender diverse people, we examine MHR’s rights universalism, possessive individualism, and state-based rationalisation of health governance. MHR hails all but no-one in particular, erasing diversity and straightwashing data medicine. It is a technological solution to state-based imperatives for health governance, an emphasis that does not serve minority communities or address health needs that attract stigma and prejudice. We counterpose these effects with citizenship framings seated in critical approaches to data assemblages and sexuality and gender diversity. We suggest ways in which data medicine, of which MHR is but one example, can be made more relevant and effective for individuals and communities whose healthcare is poorly served by mainstream health systems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Aims: The current study investigates the student nurses' attitudes and opinions towards their health promotion role during the COVID-19 pandemic using social media. Background: Social media and networking have become the most secure modes of communication among health care providers and their clients during the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world. However, it is the primary means of disseminating health information about disease prevention and control. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 296 student nurses aged 19-49 enrolled at twelve Jordanian universities (6 public and six private) in Jordan. The research team developed the self-administered questionnaire to explore the student nurses' attitudes towards their health promotion role during the COVID-19 pandemic using social media and the Internet. Results: Findings revealed that the student nurses had positive attitudes towards their health promotion role during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority of student nurses are using social media to raise the awareness of their community about COVID-19 prevention. Conclusion: The current research findings provide baseline data on the student nurses' attitudes about the proper utilization of social media to enhance their community health about COVID-19. Given the student nurses' positive attitudes about their role in COVID-19 health promotion, we strongly recommend that they be provided with the necessary knowledge and skills to demonstrate effective health education. © 2022.

AB  - The Practical Courses in Engineering Education encourage higher-level thinking and creativity. Many of the practical courses' objectives are to develop end-to-end applications. Many tools exist to teach and engage practical courses online, but at the same time, it has several challenges. Making the students engaged after class hours is needed as practical courses require a lot of time to practice. To make the students genuinely participate and learn, we have involved gamification in the course and adopted a few social media platforms like GitHub, LinkedIn, YouTube, Kaggle, medium, etc., to submit the students' work as they are all public mediums. The course is offered to 124 participants of I B.Tech. Computer Science and Engineering stream students. By leveraging social media platforms and bringing in gamification in learning, the overall teaching-learning process gets highly benefited. The course-end survey results reported the students' positive attitudes and beliefs about social media use in education. © 2022 JEET.

AB  - The literature points toward a limited understanding regarding the relationship between managers' cognition and their environmental behavioral intentions. Using behavioral reasoning theory, this study examines the relationships between managers' cognition and their behavioral intentions toward environmental initiatives. Data was collected from 256 managers working in manufacturing firms in India and modeled by structural equation modeling. The modeling of data suggests that managers' reasoning for and against energy-saving initiatives is positively associated with their self-enhancement values (SEV) and negatively with their self-transcendence values (STV). Managers' reasoning regarding the energy-saving initiatives fully and positively mediates the manifestation of SEV into their positive attitude toward energy saving. The same reasoning fully and negatively mediates the relationship between STV and the attitude toward energy-saving initiatives. Industry experience of the managers also strengthens the relationship between their values and their “reasoning for” energy-saving initiatives. The study also offers directions for future research and consequent implications. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: Drawing on the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether, how and when a supervisor's Machiavellianism leads to subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. In doing so, the authors also explore the mediating role of the supervisor's competitive world views and the moderating role of subordinates' performance on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical model was tested using three sources of data from supervisors, their subordinates and the organization. Hierarchical linear model analysis was run on supervisor and subordinate dyadic data for testing whether subordinates' performance moderated the mediated relationships or not. Findings: The results suggest that the supervisors' competitive worldviews explain the positive link between their Machiavellianism and subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision. The results highlight that the mediation effect of supervisors' competitive worldviews on the link between their Machiavellianism and their subordinates' perceptions of abusive supervision is more pronounced when subordinates' performance is low than when it is high. Research limitations/implications: This research contributes to the authors’ knowledge of the link between supervisors' Machiavellianism and abusive supervision, and how the toxic influence of their Machiavellianism is mediated by supervisors' competitive worldviews. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature on abusive supervision and personality by studying the role of personality as an antecedent of abusive supervision. Further, this study used subordinates' performance as a contextual variable for understanding abusive supervision. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Studies show that increased knowledge of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is achieved through exposure to mass media, which then contributes to positive attitudes and behaviours towards people living with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study examined the relationship between the frequency of exposure to the media and the level of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes towards HIV and AIDS among adults in Ghana. A weighted sample of 13 484 men and women 15 to 59 years old took part in the study. The main outcome variable was the HIV-related knowledge score, calculated based on responses to eight questions about general HIV concepts and HIV transmission modes. The frequency of exposure to the media was the primary explanatory variable. The relationship between the frequency of media exposure and the level of HIV-related knowledge was investigated using Poisson regression methods in Stata 13.0. Of the 13 484 respondents analysed, 25%, 88.2% and 79.7% reported reading print media, listening to the radio and watching TV at least once a week respectively. The average HIV-related knowledge score was 4.9 (SD 1.6), with 22.9% of respondents correctly answering five questions and about 2.0% correctly answering all eight questions. The frequency of exposure to the media, particularly print media and television, was associated with an increase in the level of HIV-related knowledge. When compared to having a low level of HIV-related knowledge, having a moderate and high level of HIV-related knowledge reduced the score of stigmatising attitude by 0.065 and 0.277 points, respectively. The adult population in Ghana has a very low level of HIV or AIDS knowledge, as well as a significant level of stigma associated with HIV or AIDS, which could stymie HIV prevention efforts. The media, on the other hand, provide a platform for these issues to be addressed. © 2022 NISC (Pty) Ltd.

AB  - The environmental sector is an interesting realm in Chinese politics to observe factors such as the contributions of new media activism in bottom-up communication and decision-making processes, especially during the 40 years of reform and opening up. Top-down efforts to curb environmental issues are primarily to address increasing pubic discomfort due to pollution and related problems. However, environmental movements are increasingly visible in China despite their application of stability maintenance mechanisms such as Environmental Police. It is therefore noteworthy to deeply analyse the factors that contribute to the increasing scale of movements in the country. This study examines the role of new media activism (occurring due to the public’s interactions through WeChat, Weibo, QQ, etc.) in shaping the trajectory of environmental movements in China. How are these avenues supporting alternative communication channels outside the mainstream policy making apparatus? Is the government willing to incorporate the interests developed in these channels to policymaking realms? How these behavioural changes are influencing the state–society relations in contemporary China in the context of increasing environmental concerns. The study employs agency-structure framework to analyse the interactions between new media activism and the single party ruling political structure with the support fieldwork data from China. The study examines policy documents, official declarations of the communist party, public attitude towards new media activism, and so on, in order to present a comprehensive understanding on the politics of ecology in the PRC. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - This paper analyzes representations of Simone Biles in media coverage of two major gymnastics events in 2019. It asks which, if any, gendered and racial stereotypes identified in previous scholarship about media coverage of Black and women athletes are also present in coverage of Biles. It also interrogates in what ways these stereotypes intersect as distinct forms of representation of Biles as a Black woman. Employing the tenets of feminist theory and Black feminist thought through an intersectional lens, a qualitative textual analysis of 34 articles revealed that both gendered and racial stereotypes were present in coverage of Biles. The most prominent stereotypes include feminized emotions, lack of mental fortitude, negative attitudes, and physicality. These intersecting representations underscore the persistence of these stereotypes in contemporary discourse. This paper contributes to, and advances, the literature on media representations of women athletes, Black athletes, and Black women athletes. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Human–wildlife interactions generate public interest and attract substantial media attention. This becomes particularly interesting in regions where different languages are used by media reports, creating the opportunity to investigate associations between language and the perspectives presented in the reports. In this article, we used 207 English articles (from 2006 to 2019) and 721 Chinese articles (from 2016 to 2019) on human-wild boar interactions in Hong Kong to analyze the gaps and differences in how the interactions are presented in the Chinese and English language media. Although English and Chinese news reporting on interactions follow similar geographical patterns, they differed significantly in terms of the content included, the identity of interviewees, the management strategies mentioned and the reported causes of “conflict.” The distinct presentation of human-wild boar interactions in English and Chinese news has the potential to contribute to diverging public attitudes toward the wild boar and policy development. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing and social distancing, as control measures for pandemic disease relies upon a conscientious and well-informed public who are aware of and prepared to follow advice. Unfortunately, public health messages can be undermined by competing misinformation and conspiracy theories, spread virally through communities that are already distrustful of expert opinion. In this article, we propose and analyse a simple model of the interaction between disease spread and awareness dynamics in a heterogeneous population composed of both trusting individuals who seek better quality information and will take precautionary measures, and distrusting individuals who reject better quality information and have overall riskier behaviour. We show that, as the density of the distrusting population increases, the model passes through a phase transition to a state in which major outbreaks cannot be suppressed. Our work highlights the urgent need for effective interventions to increase trust and inform the public. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Existing research has shown that the media can influence public attitudes to immigration. The adoption of a mixed-methods approach to audiences of immigration news, combined with a comparative design and a focus on Eastern Europe–a region scoring lowest in the world in terms of migrant acceptance–can bring significant advances to knowledge in this area, leading to a more rounded understanding of how media come to shape immigration attitudes. To demonstrate this, we draw on a comparative, mixed-methods data set comprising representative population surveys (N = 4,092), an expert survey (N = 60), and qualitative interviews (N = 120) conducted in four Eastern European countries. In contrast to existing research on Western Europe, we found significant variation in the links between attitudes to immigration and use of Public Service Media (PSM), with PSM consumption linked with more negative attitudes to immigration in some countries, and with more positive attitudes in others. Second, our results confirm that different attitudes to immigration are embedded in different qualitative understandings of immigration: while participants with more positive attitudes often adopted a more inclusive understanding of immigration, those with more negative attitudes adopted a narrower understanding. Third, we demonstrated the importance of family and acquaintances as trusted sources of information. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Digitally tampered images or fake images when propagated across the Web and social media, have the power to mislead, emotionally distress and influence public attitudes and behavior. Copy-Move tampering is one of the most commonly used attacks for damaging the semantics of an image. Keypoint-based methodologies are one of the effective ways of identifying a copy-move attack on an image. Existing key-point based methodologies fails to obtain a sufficient number of points on the small-smooth tampered region. Thus, for obtaining a good number of features this paper presents Hybrid Feature Detection (HFD) methodology employing Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor. Further, hierarchical clustering optimization and an improved mismatch elimination model is presented for detecting and demarking tampered segments. Experiments are conducted on standard datasets such as Dataset (D0, D1-2 and D3), GRIP, MICC-F600 and MICC-F8Multi. Better results are achieved from the proposed HFD methodology when compared with existing state-of-art tampering detection methodologies in terms of Recall, F1-score, Precision and False Positive Rate (FPR). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article examined the relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking and the related mediating effect of ingroup favoritism in a non-Western society. We investigated patriotism and nationalism as two favorable orientations toward national ingroups. We also examined their relationship with the general conspiracy mentality and the specific conspiracy beliefs that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed that conservative ideology was associated with conspiratorial beliefs in China regardless of the specific conspiracy theories related to ingroups or outgroups, which indicates such tendencies may exist universally across cultures. Patriotism was not associated with conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19, whereas nationalism was negatively associated with the conspiracy theories about China (an ingroup) and positively associated with conspiracy theories about the US (an outgroup). Moreover, nationalism mediated the relationship between ideology and specific conspiracy beliefs during the pandemic. The general conspiracy mentality did not predict conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19. The results indicate that believing conspiracy theories is not only the result of a stable conspiracy mentality but is also influenced by ideology and intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study involved a 2 (image type: funny meme vs. serious image) × 2 (level of bandwagon cues: high vs. low) between-subjects online experiment (N = 258). Statistical results showed that using Internet memes was more effective than using serious images in the setting of brand-related Twitter posts. Specifically, when this study’s participants perceived the deployed meme to be humorous, they evidenced positive attitudes toward the post and greater intention to share the post on social media. Furthermore, bandwagon cues were found to moderate the meme effect on persuasion through perceived humor. Participants’ humor perception was enhanced when exposed to a meme post featuring a large number of replies, retweets, and likes (i.e., a high level of bandwagon cues). An unexpected outcome that emerged from the data was that funny memes had a negative impact on brand recall through humor perception. This study’s exploration of funny memes as humor stimuli within the context of social media adds to the literature on humor communications in marketing, as well as illustrates the importance of bandwagon effects for humor persuasion. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The childhood adverse experiences (CAEs) are common in the general population and very common among help-seekers. Particularly, sexual and physical abuse have received a great attention in research and public media. Prevalence of CAEs and their association with attitudes towards others and psychiatric disorders were investigated. Methods: The Trauma And Distress Scale (TADS) was fulfilled by people of the general population (GP; n = 692) and by patients attending primary (PrC) and psychiatric outpatient (PsC) care (n = 415). Results: In GP, 51% reported emotional and 50% physical neglect, and 37% emotional, 23% physical 23% and 6% sexual abuse. In PsC, the corresponding figures were 82%, 73%, 68%, 37% and 17% respectively. The CAEs had a strong tendency to cumulate into same participants: 30% of GP and 66% of PsC reported three or more CAEs. In GP, participant who reported emotional neglect felt that other people had a negative attitude towards them. In the combined PrC and PsC sample, emotional neglect had a specific effect on depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Conclusions: Emotional neglect is the most frequently reported CAE and associates with attitudes towards other people and the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in adulthood. The findings received support the attachment theory launched by Bowlby and emphasise the importance of understanding emotional atmosphere that individuals are facing in their childhood and adolescence. © 2022 The Nordic Psychiatric Association.

AB  - This study advances and tests the notion that the phenomenon of guilt by association— whereby innocent organizations are penalized due to their similarity to offending organizations— is shaped by two distinct forms of generalization. We analyze how and why evaluators’ interpretative process following instances of corporate misconduct will likely include not only inductive generalization (rooted in similarity judgments and prototype-based categorization) but also deductive generalizing (rooted in evaluators’ theories and causal-based categorization). We highlight the role and relevance of this neglected distinction by extending guilt-by-association predictions to include two unique predictions based on deductive generalization. First, we posit a recipient effect: if an innocent organization falls under a negative stereotype that causally links the innocent firm with corporate misconduct, then that innocent firm will suffer a greater negative spillover effect, irrespective of its similarity to the offending firm. Second, we also posit a transmission effect: if the offending firm falls under the same negative stereotype, then the negative spillover effect to other similar firms will be lessened. We also analyze how media discourse can foster negative stereotypes, and thus amplify these two effects. We find support for our hypotheses in analyses of stock market reactions to corporate misconduct for all U.S. and international firms using reverse mergers to gain publicly traded status in the United States. We discuss the implications of our theoretical perspective and empirical findings for research on corporate misconduct, guilt by association, and stock market prejudice.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has dramatically changed social and economic life in almost all countries due to strict physical restrictions, such as social distancing and local or national lockdowns, required to promote public health and save lives. The policies implemented by most countries during each wave of the Covid-19 pandemic placed great pressure on global supply chains, bringing unprecedented challenges to international business (Mena et al., 2022), including cross-border e-commerce (Wang et al., 2021). Even with domestic markets, customers have changed consumption behaviors due to uncertainties of the pandemic and policies of quarantine. They are reducing their frequency of outdoor activities and preferring online shopping (Kawasaki et al., 2021). The Covid-19 pandemic has thus fueled the growth of e-commerce (Beckers et al., 2021), and forced traditional enterprises to rapidly convert from offline to online channels and respond with digital transformation of their business models to meet customer preferences (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2021). Changing customer preferences and behaviors caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has been a catalyst for innovation in the platform economy (Chan & Gao, 2021) and financial technology (FinTech) (Chen et al., 2021). As consumers craved greater social presence during the Covid-19 pandemic, live streaming on social networking sites and e-commerce platforms became more popular. However, the pandemic has also negatively affected sharing economy and traditional industries such as the restaurant industry, tourism and retail. Obviously, the development of the digital economy, typified by e-commerce, faces unprecedented opportunities and challenges during the Covid-19 pandemic, presenting interesting research questions for the field. © 2022, Journal of Electronic Commerce Research.

AB  - Introduction: The occurrence of coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has affected more than 247 million populations around the world. People with comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, elderly people, and people with weak immunity develop severe types of COVID-19 if exposed to the disease. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 prevention methods among hypertensive patients in North Shoa, Oromia region, Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 5/2020 to June 5/2020 in public hospitals in the North Shoa zone, Ethiopia. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and study participants were recruited using a simple random sampling technique. The data were checked for completeness and entered into the EpiData manager version 4.4.1 and transferred to SPSS version 23 for analysis purposes. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were computed and a significant association was declared with a p-value less than 0.05. Results: A total of 360 (97.0%) hypertension patients responded. This study revealed that 210 (58.3%) study participants had good knowledge of COVID-19 prevention methods, 199 (55.3%) had a favorable attitude towards COVID-19 prevention methods, and 210 (58.3%) hypertension patients at follow-up practiced COVID-19 prevention methods. Respondents who received less than two thousand Ethiopian birrs monthly and respondents who followed electronic news media were significantly associated with the use of sanitizer, respondents who had a favorable attitude towards the COVID-19 prevention method were significantly associated with mask-wearing, and respondents who received less than two thousand Ethiopian birrs monthly were significantly associated with maintaining a physical distance. Conclusion: Generally, this study finding revealed that the level of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 prevention among hypertension patients was low. Therefore, increasing knowledge, attitude, and practice on COVID-19 among hypertension patients requires a coordinated effort from the government, non-government, and health professionals. © 2022 Geleta et al.

AB  - This paper assesses the drivers of water conservation practices among opinion leaders in a water-scarce district of Ghana. It was found that the majority of the respondents have a positive attitude towards conservation of water and also felt hurt to see water go to waste. The majority do engage in water conservation practices. Age, environmental concern, income, perceived behaviour control, gender, and emotion were important drivers of water conservation practices. Social norm was found to exert no significant effect on water conservation. Policymakers should involve opinion leaders in the promotion of water conservation behaviour. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION In the digital age, Internet and social networks are the most important media for exchanging information and personal experiences. Individuals with health problems can use social media to increase their knowledge about diseases and treatment, often having the Internet as their main information source. Vaccines have been classified as one of the most important medical discoveries of all time. Vaccination acceptance is considered critical for the prevention of contagious diseases. The present study attempted to investigate the general public’s perceptions on vaccination and their sources of information about vaccines, in Greece. METHODS The study was conducted through a web-based survey. The questionnaire consisted of closed-ended, 7-point Likert scale questions and multiple-choice questions. The data collected were subjected to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Also, bivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential predictor variables concerning information sources on the participants’ opinions on vaccines.RESULTS Responses by 683 individuals were obtained. Healthcare professionals are considered by the participants as the preferred source of information on vaccination. Older age groups express a higher degree of agreement regarding doctors as preferred information source, compared to the younger ones. More than 60% of the participants choose to be informed by official bodies such as the National Public Health Organization, the Ministry of Health, the WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. A small proportion of the respondents (8%) stated that often to always they preferred social media as information sources about vaccinations. Doctors and Ministry of Health as sources of information and older age groups were found to be strong predictors of participants’ positive attitude towards vaccines. CONCLUSIONS The study revealed that the vast majority of the participants are positive about vaccinations and seem to rely on more official sources of information on vaccination than the general Internet and social media. Communication efforts on vaccination awareness should be directed at younger ages and in particular through social media © 2022 Skarpa P. E. and Garoufallou E.

AB  - Individual’s decision to cooperate with disease prevention varies based on their respective health beliefs and common factors that motivate actions. Previous research has found that pandemic anxiety, high health literacy, and eHealth literacy influenced healthcare behavior. Understanding how the pandemic affects people on modifying preventive health behavior is promising. Accordingly, this cross-sectional study focusing on health behavior utilized Structural Equation Modeling to characterize causative factors of anxiety, health literacy, eHealth literature, and protection in the new normal of COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Online surveys used a snowball sampling method through social media to recruit participants aged over 20 years in 8 provinces in Thailand. iGeneration and millennials were the top two, making up 75.0% of the 700-respondents in total. Independent variables: Health Literacy (p = .030); eHealth Literacy (p < .001); and anxiety (p = .040) significantly influenced the new normal. The new normal practices: hand hygiene, wearing hygienic masks and social distancing, maintaining good health, and preventing virus exposure by making digital payments could be indicated by 34% of Thai people by all those independent variables. This means that those who are more concerned and literate about health literacy and eHealth literacy, will make better health decisions and practice more preventive health care. Individuals may use health knowledge to make healthy decisions to protect themselves from the current pandemic. They can also use what they have learned to defend themselves from other emerging infectious illnesses in the future. Therefore, official institutions should provide helpful and timely health information that is easily accessible. Public health interventions should prioritize the availability of health information in the electronic form on various social media platforms to educate people to protect themselves from the spread of disease. The information should be comprehensible and practical for all socioeconomic groups. © 2022, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lassa fever is a serious infectious disease that has eluded total eradication in Nigeria. The disease affects about 21% of the country’s over 200 million population and currently has no preventive vaccines; hence, health stakeholders have continuously used the mass media as independent and complementary intervention tools to educate the public and create appropriate awareness on the best preventive protocol for the disease. This study examined the influence of public exposure to mass media sensitisation messages on Lassa fever-related knowledge, attitudes and practices among residents of eight rural communities in South-South Nigeria. It used a survey questionnaire to collect data from 384 respondents selected through multistage sampling. After controlling for confounding variables, the results of the hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that increased exposure to mass media messages on Lassa fever prevention was significantly associated with higher knowledge (b =.609) and positive attitudes towards the prevention of the outbreak of the disease (b =.600). However, exposure to mass media sensitisation messages on the disease had no significant influence on public health practices related to Lassa fever. Thus, the study called on health communication practitioners and policy makers to design Lassa fever media messages in languages prevalently spoken in the rural communities, and package such messages in a manner that gives due consideration to the individual and cultural disposition of the target audience. © 2022, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

AB  - The paper aims to determine how cultural taste and social tolerance coincide and which symbolic boundaries they relate to. The empirical analyses scrutinise three taste orientations – omnivorousness, univorousness and ‘categorical tolerance’ (Lizardo & Skiles 2016) – to answer the following questions using two nationally representative surveys on cultural taste in Finland: (1) How did the cultural taste orientations change between 2007 and 2018 when considering musical like, dislike and ambivalence? (2) How do socio-political attitudes associate with cultural taste orientations and socio-economic factors, and can we observe change in these dynamics between 2007 and 2018? A longitudinal research design is used to explore whether there are changes in taste that tap to symbolic exclusion, inclusion or ambivalence. The results show that the omnivores and the univores are on many accounts situated on the opposite ends of the liberal-conservative axis. Their views deviate from each other, although the polarization in this sense has diminished in a decade. In addition to their wide-ranging taste and advantageous social position, we found the omnivores’ social attitudes to be very liberal, postmaterialist and more tolerant than the average. The absence of ambivalence among the univores suggests very rigid symbolic boundary-drawing by them. The social indistinctiveness of the categorical tolerants was quite visible, and it indeed increased over time. However, the categorical tolerants’ responses, particularly in 2018, were in most part inflated by their inability to neither agree nor disagree with the socio-political statements. Through a systematic analysis of various taste orientations over time, the study contributes to the understanding of cultural taste and symbolic boundaries by way of providing a gauge of the social, political and moral ambience in the society. The findings suggest growing tolerance in general, and decreasing polarization between the extreme taste orientations, omnivorism and univorism. However, the increased symbolic inclusion and ambivalence (of the categorical tolerants especially) are perhaps engendered by the features of modern social (media) reality, whose ubiquitous presence potentially affects how willingly people make judgements, whether social or cultural, and how much of personal values and tastes are communicated publicly in general. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The core idea of the find-remind-and-bind theory articulated by (Algoe, 2012, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 6, 455) is that receiving expressed gratitude facilitates positive attitudes toward the expressor such as increased prosocial behaviour. The current study tries to observe the phenomena in Japan where apologies are sometimes used when people express gratitude. In this experimental study, 671 Japanese participants received expressions of gratitude, apologies, both, or neither (control condition) in exchange for their help. The results showed that expressed gratitude had the most positive effect compared to the control, apology and both conditions; that is, expressed gratitude most strongly facilitated the message receiver's prosocial behaviour, self-disclosure, predicted outcome values, and social worth. Expressed apologies showed a limited positive effect. A structural equation model further indicated that predicted outcome values and social worth functioned in unique ways to mediate the link between expressed gratitude and prosocial behaviour as well as self-disclosure. © 2022 Asian Association of Social Psychology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - After one pandemic year of remote or hybrid instructional modes, universities struggled with plans for an in-person autumn (fall) semester in 2021. To help inform university reopening policies, we collected survey data on social contact patterns and developed an agent-based model to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in university settings. Considering a reproduction number of R0 = 3 and 70% immunization effectiveness, we estimated that at least 80% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening with relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). By contrast, at least 60% of the university population immunized through natural infection or vaccination is needed for safe university reopening when NPIs are adopted. Nevertheless, attention needs to be paid to large-gathering events that could lead to infection size spikes. At an immunization coverage of 70%, continuing NPIs, such as wearing masks, could lead to a 78.39% reduction in the maximum cumulative infections and a 67.59% reduction in the median cumulative infections. However, even though this reduction is very beneficial, there is still a possibility of nonnegligible size outbreaks because the maximum cumulative infection size is equal to 1.61% of the population, which is substantial. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Dementia is the decline in cognitive function sufficient to impair one's accustomed functioning. Countries with aging populations, such as Singapore, face rising rates of dementia. Dementia patients and their caregivers endure great financial and emotional stress. With the broad aim of minimizing these stresses, this study provides a cross-sectional view of the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) towards dementia in middle-aged Singaporean residents. Objective: We aim to examine 1) the associations between demographic correlates and KAP; and 2) the effect of dementia knowledge on attitudes and perceptions towards dementia. Methods: An online anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents aged 45 to 65 years old in English, Mandarin, and Malay. Knowledge was evaluated across three domains: symptoms, risk factors, and management. Total and domain scores were dichotomized as good or poor knowledge using median cut-offs. Attitudes/perceptions across six domains were evaluated on Likert scales, and responses to each question were dichotomized into positive or negative attitudes/perceptions. Results: From 1,733 responses, 1,209 valid complete responses were accepted (mean age±SD 54.8±5.12 years old, females=69.6%). Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer knowledge and greater barriers to risk-mitigating lifestyle modifications. Lack of personal experience with dementia and poor knowledge were also associated with erroneous attitudes/perceptions. Conclusion: Socioeconomic status and personal experience affect KAP towards dementia. Policy and education campaigns to address KAP towards dementia should account for baseline differences across demographics, for greater improvements in dementia incidence and support. © 2022-IOS Press.

AB  - This article examines how Palestinians' intergroup contact experiences relate to their attitudes towards interactions with Israelis (i.e., normalization). We draw on four recent advances in intergroup contact literature. First, recent research indicates that positive contact can impede disadvantaged groups' motivation to challenge inequalities. Second, increased endorsement of normalization mediates this sedative effect of positive contact on motivation to resist in the West Bank. Third, negative contact has been related to increased motivation for social change. Fourth, institutions and societal norms shape the meaning of intergroup contact and its effect on intergroup relations. We hypothesize that negative experiences at checkpoints can act as reminders of institutionalized inequalities and thus attenuate sedative effects. Furthermore, we explore the contextual boundary conditions of such reminder effects. Analyses of cross-sectional survey conducted among a representative sample (N = 1,000) in the West Bank including Jerusalem showed that (1) positive intergroup contact related to normalization endorsement (sedative effect), (2) negative intergroup contact related to decreased normalization endorsement (mobilizing effect), and (3) negative contact experiences (at checkpoints) canceled out the effect of positive contact (reminder effect), but only in Jerusalem. Results suggest that the impacts of intergroup contact need to be interpreted in light of institutionalized forms of group inequality and segregation. © 2022 International Society of Political Psychology

AB  - Background. The obesity epidemic is considered one of the main challenges for modern medicine. It has been proven that bariatric surgery is more effective than nonsurgical interventions to manage weight-related comorbidities. The general surgeon needs to understand how tooth erosion advances in gastroesophageal reflux in people who have had bariatric surgery. Dental erosion caused due to gastric reflux begins with the enamel, which is the tough, protective coating that covers our teeth. While it is tough, it is prone to an extremely acidic environment with a low pH, where it begins to soften and demineralize, gradually wearing away and exposing the more sensitive areas of the tooth. Because of the growing popularity of this subspecialty, general surgeons should develop a basic clinical and surgical understanding of these standard procedures and complications, regardless of their interest in obesity surgery. Aim. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the awareness and attitude of surgeons regarding dental erosion on patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted on general surgeons from different regions of Saudi Arabia who perform bariatric surgeries. Data collection was done by sending the questionnaire to the general surgeons by different means of social media (WhatsApp, e-mail, Facebook, etc.), and it was also distributed through the Saudi Arabia Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. Results. A total of 25 general surgeons responded to the survey. Half of the respondents know what dental erosion is, 52%. Most of them, 72%, are not aware of the relationship between dental erosion and acid reflux or vomiting. They reported that 52% of patients complain of gastroesophageal reflux disorder. Conclusion. The general surgeons had inadequate awareness and attitude regarding dental erosion on bariatric surgery patients. Our findings suggest that a lack of adequate awareness and a negative attitude among general surgeons are grounds for concern and that more should be done to avoid oral health complications. © 2022 Omir Aldowah.

AB  - Legal attitudes, religion, and attributions relate to insanity defense attitudes and legal decisions in insanity cases. Religious fundamentalism has consistently predicted punitiveness associated with insanity; however, the current research focuses on moral disengagement as an explanatory link in the fundamentalist and insanity chain. Additional exploratory interests examined how defendants’ perceived proximity to jurors might act as a potential moderator. The current study uses factorial survey design to examine the relationships between the variables using a mock jury insanity trial. Results suggest religious fundamentalism is related to harsher verdicts and sentences, and these relationships are mediated by moral disengagement attributions, authoritarian attitudes towards the persons with mental illness, and negative attitudes towards the insanity defense. Based on findings, prosecution and defense should consider moral and religious themes presented in their arguments. Additionally, defendants pleading insanity should be aware of how juror attitudes and biases might affect the trial and verdict processes. © 2021 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.

AB  - Background: For patients diagnosed with chronic illness, attitude towards treatment may play an important role in health and survival. For example, negative attitudes towards treatment have been related to poorer adherence to treatment recommendations and prescribed medication across a range of chronic illnesses. In addition, prior research has shown that attitude towards treatment assessed through a psychiatric interview predicted survival at 1 year after bone marrow transplantation with great accuracy (> 90%). Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between a self-report attitude to a treatment measure that operationalized a psychiatric interview, and survival over 17 years in a sample of people living with HIV (PLWH). Participants and Design: Participants (N = 177) who were in the mid-range of HIV illness at baseline (CD4s 150 to 500, no prior AIDS-defining clinical symptom) were administered the Montreal-Miami Attitude to Treatment (MMAT-20/HIV) scale and followed longitudinally to determine survival at 17 years. Measures: The Montreal-Miami Attitude to Treatment (MMAT-20/HIV) scale is a 20-item self-report questionnaire designed to survey multiple factors that contribute to an overall psychological construct of the treatment process. Results: The MMAT-20/HIV predicted survival over 17 years controlling for biomedical (baseline CD4, viral load, antiretroviral medications, age) and psychosocial (race, education, antiretroviral medications) variables. Those in the top half on the MMAT-20/HIV were almost twice as likely to survive than those in the lower half. Scores on the MMAT-20/HIV were significantly but modestly correlated with adherence (r =.20, p <.05), but adherence was not a mediator of the relationship between the MMAT-20/HIV and survival. Conclusions: An individual’s attitude towards the treatment process predicted survival, raising the possibility that optimal clinical management would include ways to probe these attitudes and intervene where possible. The ease of administering the MMAT-20 and adaptability to other illnesses could facilitate this endeavor. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society of General Internal Medicine.

AB  - background In France, despite fear-based communication by the authorities and the media, vaccination against COVID-19 has received little support from the population. For a young population often convinced that severe forms of the disease affect older people, we hypothesized that communication based on the idea of love would be more effective than communication based on fear of vaccination. participants and procedure In a convenience online French sample (N = 480, Mage = 19.4), vaccination intention was asked after fear priming, love priming, no love/prejudice priming, or a control condition. Participants also reported their fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and the recommendation they would make regarding vaccination of a loved/unloved person. results Vaccination intention was higher in the love condition than in the fear and no love/prejudice conditions. Surprisingly, fear of vaccination was lower in participants who were presented with fear-inducing questions. conclusions Implications of these results are discussed in relation to the fear of vaccination and the transpersonal value of the idea of love. The results suggest that COVID-19 is experienced as a threat both to oneself and to those one loves most. Therefore, calls for fear in the media and on social networks seem less likely to motivate a young population to vaccinate than the reminder of intense emotional ties to loved ones. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the usability and long-term adherence to the mobile hyperacuity app Alleye in patients with retinal pathology. Methods: We enroled 72 patients (95 eyes) mainly treated for wet AMD (48/95; 50.5%). We calculated changes of clinical characteristics and the System Usability Score (SUS), and personal ratings of usefulness and number of tests performed per month at a follow-up visit of eighteen months. Results: At baseline, mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 74.9 letters (SD 14.8), mean age was 69.9 (SD 11.4) and 39/72 (54.2%) were female. Of included patients, 47/72 (65.2%) reported to use mobile devices daily. The retention rate until last follow-up was 73.6 % (53/72). The median SUS score at baseline was 90 (interquartile range (IQR) 82.5–95) and 92.5 (IQR 82.5–95) in the follow-up. No association between changes of SUS and clinical characteristics was seen. At baseline, 76.4% (55/72) stated that they would recommend the app to a friend, 83.3% (60/72) were very satisfied with the app and 58/72 (80.6%) of respondents said they trusted the app. These assessments remained similar among patients remaining on the program until the follow-up. Patients who dropped out of the study (n = 19) did not differ in age, gender, BCVA, and SUS at baseline, but stated that they did not use the mobile device daily (Odds Ratio 7.40 (95%CI: 2.32–23.65); p = 0.001). Conclusions: The majority of users willing to perform home monitoring with the Alleye app are satisfied with the usability and have a positive attitude towards its trustworthiness and usefulness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

AB  - Background: American adults have gained weight during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about how patients who are medically managed for overweight and obesity, including patients who are prescribed antiobesity pharmacotherapy, have fared. Objective: To assess the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on weight, food choices, and health behaviors in patients receiving medical treatment for overweight or obesity. Methods: Adult patients treated at an urban academic weight management center between 1 May 2019 and 1 May 2020 were electronically surveyed between 23 February and 23 March 2021. The survey assessed changes in weight, eating, behaviors, and the use of antiobesity medications (AOMs) following issuance of social distancing/stay-at-home policies in March 2020. Results: In 970 respondents, median percent weight change for those taking AOMs was −0.459% [interquartile range −5.46%–(+3.73%)] compared to +2.33% [IQR −1.92%–(+6.52%)] for those not taking AOMs (p &lt; 0.001). More participants achieved ≥5% weight loss if they were taking AOMs compared to those who were not (26.7% vs. 15.8%, p = 0.004), and weight gain ≥5% was also lower in those taking AOMs (19.8% vs. 30.3%, p = 0.004). Patients with pre-pandemic BMI ≥30 kg/m2 taking AOMs experienced the greatest weight reduction, and there was greater weight loss associated with increased physical activity. Conclusions and Relevance: Medical weight management protected against weight gain during this period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased physical activity, decreased alcohol intake, and use of AOMs were factors that contributed to this protective effect. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Positive intergroup contact reliably reduces prejudice, yet little is known about the metacognitive processes involved in recalling prior contact experiences and their impact on outgroup tolerance. The present research examined whether contact interventions that rely on the recollection of past contact experiences can be susceptible to ease of retrieval effects, and the potential impact on intergroup attitudes. Specifically, we tested whether manipulating the number of contact memories participants were asked to recall (five vs. one) impacts on outgroup tolerance, and whether this effect is contingent upon participants’ prior contact experiences. Results of two experiments (N = 220) revealed a moderated mediation effect of contact recollection on outgroup tolerance via perceived ease of retrieval, dependent upon levels of prior contact. Recalling more (five) versus fewer (one) contact memories was perceived as more difficult, and this, in turn, decreased tolerance, specifically for individuals low in prior contact. Countering this negative indirect effect, however, recalling more contact experiences had a positive direct effect. Therefore, greater cognitive effort appears to act as a suppressor of the positive effect of contact recall. Our findings provide insight into meta-cognitive processes involved in recalling autobiographical contact memories, and the resulting impact on intergroup relations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This study integrates cultivation and intergroup threat theories to examine media cultivation effects during the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that U.S. media have consistently portrayed China as a threat and target of blame. The cultivation of media has thus resulted in perceived threat of and blame on Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic. Results of a cross-sectional survey in two samples (MTurk: N = 375; college: N = 566) showed that the amount of media consumption predicted stronger perceptions that Chinese people were a health threat, and also predicted blame on Chinese people for the COVID-19 outbreak. Threat perception and blame were further associated with support of media content that derogated China, stronger intentions to attack, and weaker intentions to help Chinese people. The findings have profound implications for intergroup threat and cultivation research, and practical importance for intergroup relations, especially when the global community finds itself in a public crisis. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has raised an important question of whether government efforts (GEFs), especially communication work, could prevent the outbreak of this pandemic by enhancing public trust and public compliance with the government. This research answers this question by focusing on the case of Vietnam, a low-resource country that gained some achievements during the first pandemic year 2020. In particular, this study aims to investigate the relationship between GEF, public trust and public compliance during the country’s first nationwide social distancing. Design/methodology/approach: The structural equation modelling is used to analyse data collected from 467 respondents in Vietnam during the nationwide social distancing in 2020. Findings: Perceived GEF is positively associated with public compliance with the government directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust in government (PTG). The empirical results also reveal the effectiveness of government communication work, one among the government’s great efforts, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of intensity and diversity in communication and information channels. Practical implications: During a pandemic, the governments must enhance public compliance with public health measures to implement the anti-epidemic missions effectively. Therefore, it is important to raise public perception of GEF and PTG. The study’s findings highlight that governments in developing countries should implement relevant responses and policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises, especially in the context that effective vaccines are unavailable or insufficient. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is among the first attempts that examine the role of GEF, especially public health communication work, in raising public compliance directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust. The study carries some important messages for containing a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The present research explores the influence of message orientation and audience power on persuasion. We propose that matching message orientation and audience power increases the message’s persuasiveness. Three studies were conducted to test the matching hypothesis and explore their underlying psychological mechanisms. Study 1 explores the influence of trait power and message orientation on persuasion. Study 2 replicates and extends the matching effect by manipulating the power state with experience recall. Study 3 examines the mediating role of perceived fluency by priming the power state with role-play imagination and excluding the potential interference of trait power and mood. The results show that matching between message orientation and audience power can improve message persuasiveness. Specifically, for low-power individuals, the concrete message was more persuasive; for high-power individuals, the abstract message was more persuasive. Moreover, perceived fluency plays a mediating role in the matching effect. The research provides a new matching perspective for the field of power and persuasion and contributes to understanding the psychological mechanism behind the message-matching effect. It has significant practical implications in the fields of communication, advertising, and political campaigns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic during initial lockdowns created a problematic situation in which individuals were forced to remain within their homes and were forced to follow social distance restrictions for the well-being of themselves and others. In response, people use social networking sites on mobile phones to gather information about the COVID-19 epidemic. This study aims to investigate the influence of lockdowns on mobile phone usage among university students. Moreover, the harmful effects of COVID-19, such as anxiety, social isolation, and nomophobia among national and international students, are also investigated. The total sample size for this cross-sectional study is 438 individuals. The sample consists of Pakistani students studying at local universities (58.7%) and Pakistani students studying abroad (41.3%). The indigenous data is gathered through convenience sampling. The snowball sampling approach is adopted to acquire data from overseas. The findings show that the excessive use of mobile phones for browsing social networking sites to get information about the pandemic caused COVID-19 anxiety, nomophobia (“no-mobile-phone” phobia), and feelings of social isolation. Our results indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak greatly impacted students' massive mobile phone use and psycho-social well-being, regardless of their geographic location. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we study the short-run evolution of political trust during the recent covid-19 pandemic using survey data for a sample of young individuals living in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. In particular, we analyze whether pre-pandemic perceptions and experiences of citizens about various dimensions of local governments and institutional quality had any mediating effect on the evolution of political trust after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic. The results show a relative increase in political trust of about 9% in regions with high institutional quality (75th percentile) compared with regions with low institutional quality (25th percentile) over the period 2019−2020. This divergence can be associated with either a better performance of policymakers in high-quality institutions regions, or to more positive attitudes toward politicians by citizens that, before the pandemic, believed to live in regions with efficient institutions. Overall results are not affected by the inclusion of regional fixed effects or by possible differential evolution of political trust according to a large set of observable regional characteristics. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Newspapers often play a significant role in providing knowledge about political matters and may shape public opinion about political figures. However, a focus on newspaper coverage of some of the first Black mayors of major US cities and themes related to racial identity and policy is under-examined. The current investigation adopts an ethnographic content analysis and examines 30 days of major daily newspaper coverage of Black mayoral campaigns in Los Angeles, Detroit, New Orleans, Newark, and Chicago before each mayoral election. Findings reveal that news coverage draws attention to overt racial narratives and emphasizes racial stereotypes. However, news coverage of the candidates’ policy proposals was present and often nonracialized. The outcomes suggest that the inclusion of racial identity and policies, while not entirely favorable, may increase awareness of each candidate’s policies, potentially contributing to their electability. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the primary causative agent of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination against human papillomavirus is more effective against cervical cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes toward the human papillomavirus vaccines among female high-school students. Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among female high-school students in Jimma town, Ethiopia. Study participants were selected using a simple random sampling method. Self-administered interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered using Epi-data version 3.5, exported and analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 21. The Chi-squared (χ2) test was performed to determine the statistical significance between the outcome variable and independent variables. Results: A total of 366 students participated in this study with a response rate of 94.8%. Only half (52.7%) and nearly one-third (31.4%) of the respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination, respectively. The predictors that included parents’ educational status (χ2 = 1.479, P = .003), students participating in school mini-media (χ2 = 1.519, P = .036), students who had a smartphone (χ2 = 2.118, P = .008), availability of radio or television (TV) at home (χ2 = 2.163, P = .049), and students who received information from social-media (χ2 = 2.15, P = .025) were significantly associated with knowledge of the HPV vaccine. Conclusion: Overall knowledge and attitude toward HPV vaccination were low. All concerned bodies should work jointly to enhance the knowledge and attitudes of female students toward Human Papilloma Virus vaccination. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The shift to remote work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically limited spontaneous workplace interpersonal interactions. For one interpersonal relationship in particular, the work spouse, the sudden physical distance may impact the energy work spouses draw from one another. Drawing on interactional ritual theory, this study aims to investigate the relationship between interaction frequency and organizational outcomes mediated by relational energy amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: During the COVID-19 pandemic, working adults who indicated they had a work spouse were recruited via Qualtrics to participate in a two-part online study. Findings: Complete data from 120 participants across both time periods revealed that more frequent interaction between work spouses is associated with increased job satisfaction and affective commitment mediated by relational energy. Originality/value: This study represents the first empirical examination of individual and organizational outcomes of a unique interpersonal workplace relationship. Additionally, this study enhances our understanding of the impact of relational energy in socially distanced situations between employees in a close, intimate (non-sexual) pair bond. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Politics now intrudes into many aspects of social life. How does this occur and what are its consequences? We study the sources of politicized attitudes toward ESPN, a sports media outlet involved in controversies where politics and sports intersect, and consider their implications for sports news use. We assess two potential contributors to politicized attitudes toward ESPN: exposure to political media criticizing the network and encounters with its sports coverage. In survey-linked web browsing data and a survey experiment, exposure to political media led the public to evaluate ESPN in political terms, showing messages from political elites can affect opinions of entertainment media. In contrast, exposure to ESPN’s typical sports coverage failed to alter views of the network. We also find these newly politicized attitudes do not reduce use of ESPN, demonstrating the intrusion of politics into a seemingly apolitical setting may not displace other considerations underlying behavior. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Panic buying frequently occurs in health pandemics, disturbing both the market and people’s lives. The situation is exacerbated by the easy spread of misinformation online. With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers’ derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants’ attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics. © 2022 National Communication Association.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the predictive strength of perceived social support on divorce adjustment process, and the mediating role of self-forgiveness in this predictive relationship. In line with this, the hypothetical structural model was tested with a total of 150 individuals who were divorced or in the legal divorce process. The findings showed that perceived social support positively predicted divorce adjustment at high levels, positive and negative attitudes of self-forgiveness did not significantly predict divorce adjustment, and additionally, they did not function as mediating variables in the prediction of divorce adjustment by perceived social support. The fit indices of the tested model revealed good level of fit. The findings were discussed within the framework of the relevant literature and the cultural context. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The current investigation tested if people’s basic belief in the notion that human beings have developed from other animals (i.e., belief in evolution) can predict human-to-human prejudice and intergroup hostility. Using data from the American General Social Survey and Pew Research Center (Studies 1–4), and from three online samples (Studies 5, 7, 8) we tested this hypothesis across 45 countries, in diverse populations and religious settings, across time, in nationally representative data (N = 60,703), and with more comprehensive measures in online crowdsourced data (N = 2,846). Supporting the hypothesis, low belief in human evolution was associated with higher levels of prejudice, racist attitudes, and support for discriminatory behaviors against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ), Blacks, and immigrants in the United States (Study 1), with higher ingroup biases, prejudicial attitudes toward outgroups, and less support for conflict resolution in samples collected from 19 Eastern European countries (Study 2), 25 Muslim countries (Study 3), and Israel (Study 4). Further, among Americans, lower belief in evolution was associated with greater prejudice and militaristic attitudes toward political outgroups (Study 5). Finally, perceived similarity to animals (a construct distinct from belief in evolution, Study 6) partially mediated the link between belief in evolution and prejudice (Studies 7 and 8), even when controlling for religious beliefs, political views, and other demographic variables, and were also observed for nondominant groups (i.e., religious and racial minorities). Overall, these findings highlight the importance of belief in human evolution as a potentially key individual-difference variable predicting racism and prejudice © 2022.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of exposure to news frames on attitudes toward Syrian refugee admissions and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings show that framing Syrian refugees, ranging from benefits, victims to a security threat did invoke changes of attitudes toward admitting Syrian refugees. Participants reading a benefit frame story expressed more favorable opinions on accepting Syrian refugees than participants in the threat frame condition. In contrast to the extant literature, arguing victim frame enhances positive attitudes, the findings suggested that participants, who were exposed to a victim frame story yielded stronger anti-immigrant sentiment than participants who read a threat frame story. These findings advance scholarship on media framing of refugees and its effect on anti-immigrant sentiment and have important refugee admission policy and advocacy implications. © 2022 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - The current narrative review aimed to evaluate the effects and role of social media in the covid-19 pandemic. The examinations show that web-based media have been utilized to share perspectives, medical care, and social distancing during the Covid-19 emergency. However, social media networks have also been used in spreading bogus information to the general public during the Covid-19 pandemic. Along these lines, utilizing web-based media can be an important method for experts and governments to forestall the spread of this virus. The paper contributes in many ways like offering opportunity and remediation on the negative effects of social media during covid-19 such as the spread of misinformation to the general public. In addition, the paper explores the enhancement of public health practitioners’ reliance on social media as a tool for appropriate information dissemination, as well as assisting media personnel in understanding the gravity of the situation and the barriers to effective communication of public health messages. © 2022, Social Medicine Publishing Group.

AB  - This article examines the reception and dissemination of ‘malign information influence’ (MII) in a liberal democracy; information sponsored by authoritarian regimes or other hostile actors and projected through international broadcasting outlets across borders. The study contributes to the scarce research on the reception of narratives transmitted by the Russian state-supported media platforms RT and Sputnik, exposing characteristics, political attitudes, and sharing behaviors of RT/Sputnik consumers. A nationwide, representative survey (n: 3033) from November 2020 revealed a surprisingly high number of Swedish RT/Sputnik consumers (7%), with an overrepresentation of young, men and supports of non-parliamentarian parties and the right wing, nationalist Sweden Democratic Party. These consumers are somewhat more willing than non-consumers to disseminate news on social media and in real life despite being distrustful of the sources. The findings strengthen previous research in demonstrating the attractiveness of identity grievance narratives among alternative media consumers, yet the results show that RT/Sputnik consumers also aligned with narratives that contrasts with national security policy. They state less trust in politicians, institutions, the media, news, and journalism, yet are comparatively prone to share unreliable or untrue news content on social media and in real life. The analysis thus identified a section of media consumers who can function as vehicles for the dissemination of MII. The article contributes to the under-researched problem of the potential of MII to take root and provides a basis for future qualitative research that can refine and provide nuance to the knowledge of reception of MII. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to identify the antecedents of giving charitable donations (Sadaqah) during the pandemic in a majority-Muslim country. This paper proposes and tests a theoretical framework in which attitude toward giving donations mediates the effects of perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and past behavior on giving charitable donations (Sadaqah). The authors also investigate the mediating effect of attitude toward giving donations and the moderating effect of Islamic religiosity in an emerging nation characterized by the dominance of the Islamic doctrine. Gender, age and income have been examined as control variables. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from a sample of 377 respondents from Morocco were analyzed to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings: The results indicate that past behavior, subjective norms, attitude toward giving donations and intention to donate are key predictors of giving charitable donation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper also confirms the mediating effect of attitude toward giving donations, e.g. subjective norms trigger positive attitude toward giving donations, which increases respondents’ donation frequency. The results also suggest a significant moderating effect of Islamic religiosity, e.g. individuals who feel themselves as highly religious are more likely to develop a favorable attitude toward giving donations and are therefore more likely to donate during the pandemic. Practical implications: The findings suggest practical and social implications for both academics and practitioners. As attitude, subjective norm, past behavior and intention are found to significantly influence giving charitable donations (Sadaqah), fundraising organizations should give serious attention on these factors to improve individuals’ charitable giving (Sadaqah). Such organizations should also consider the use of faith-based messages and religious morals when planning their advertising campaigns in majority-Muslim markets. Originality/value: Although preliminary studies have already attempted to provide knowledge about the factors influencing giving donations among both Muslims and nonMuslims, potential antecedents of giving donations (Sadaqah) during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been considered and are yet to be empirically investigated. This paper provides new perceptions on factors influencing giving donations on a majority-Muslim majority country where no zakat institution operates. Such findings can be useful for both academicians, fundraising organizations and policymakers in Morocco to promote charitable actions and boost its socio-economic affects. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has promoted changes in lifestyle behaviors, such as food consumption, sleep, and physical activity (PA). Few longitudinal studies have investigated these changes in young adults. Aim: This study aimed to assess lifestyle behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in young adult males. Methods: 50 young adult males (18–35 years) recruited by posters and social media in Florianopolis, Brazil, provided data on food consumption, PA, and sleep in 2018–2019 (baseline) and during the pandemic in 2020 (follow-up). PA and sleep variables were assessed through self-reported questionnaires. Food records were used to evaluate food consumption. Weight was measured using Bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and using self-reported at follow-up. Multilevel linear regression models and generalized linear multilevel were used to test differences between baseline and follow-up. Results: The findings indicated significant changes at follow-up, compared to baseline. Decreased consumption of total fat (β = −13.32, 95% CI (−22.45; −4.18), p < 0.01), sodium (β = −1330.72, 95% CI (−1790.63; −870.82), p < 0.01), cholesterol (β = −212.99, 95% CI (−269.8; −156.18), p < 0.01), total sugars (β = −65.12, 95% CI (−80.94; −49.29), p < 0.01), alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverage were observed. Despite that, a slight increase in weight was also observed (80.70 ± 16.37 kg vs. 82.99 ± 15.42 kg, p = 0.000748). Sleep duration increased (β = 0.7596, 95% CI (0.41; 1.11), p < 0.01), and occupational PA decreased (β = −1168.1, 95% CI (−1422.33; −913.83), p < 0.01), while domestic (β = 394.04, 95%CI (114.68; 673.39, p < 0.01)) and leisure PA (β = 499.91, 95% CI (245.28; 754.53), p < 0.01) increased. Conclusion: Our results suggest that social distancing policies positively impacted eating habits, sleep, and PA patterns. These changes are possibly linked to increased awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Media coverage of Muslims has been repeatedly shown to be negative, and attitudes toward Muslims in American society are typically more negative than attitudes toward other social groups. Does the tone of media coverage directly affect public attitudes? This relationship is not well established with respect to Muslims, nor as a proposition about social groups in general. We use an online between-subjects experiment to examine whether exposure to articles of quantifiably different valences about Muslims or Catholics affects reported attitudes toward each of those groups. We find clear support for this proposition. Our additional tests demonstrate that this effect persists but is attenuated when money is at stake. We also identify anxiety as a key mediator between exposure to articles of different valences and attitudes about each group. Our findings suggest that articles of a particular tone can influence views of social groups. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Gen Z consumers are the most lucrative segment concerning fashion products, including apparel and have showcased a willingness to shift towards more sustainable processes. This research explores the mediating role of positive attitude towards sustainable apparel with green perceived value and intention to purchase sustainable apparel amongst Gen Z. The paper also explores a moderated mediation model with materialistic values and consumer knowledge about sustainable apparel as moderators. A survey method was employed to collect data, and 308 undergraduate students from universities of Delhi–National Capital Region (NCR) were selected as respondents. The study results indicated a partial mediating role of positive attitude towards sustainable apparel and confirms the moderating role of materialistic values and consumer knowledge about sustainable apparel. Further, materialistic values and consumer knowledge were suggested as significant moderators in the model. The study also confirms a significant relationship among–green perceived value, positive attitude towards sustainable apparel, and intention to purchase sustainable apparel. © 2022 Korean Scholars of Marketing Science.

AB  - This paper argues that the emergence of social media as a new public sphere has shaped masculine identity in the cyber platform. Such masculinity in Assamese society (the Assamese-speaking community), based on the images of the ideal Assamese man is linked with a form of Assamese nationalistic masculinity that gathered momentum during the Assam Movement (1979–1985). Politics of identity in Assam is basically trapped in the world of appearances, fighting real and imaginary enemies, and drawing strength from prejudices and misconceptions of groups, about themselves and others. This process of identity creation also shaped the identity of the “ideal” Assamese man in the recent socio-political history of Assam. This article is an attempt to define how masculinity works in the cyber world by focusing attention on Assamese nationalistic masculinity which is based on the image of the “RealAssamese Man.” The “Real Assamese Man,” in turn, draws inspiration from a socio-cultural context which started with the creation of Assamese iconographies of masculinity which were later transformed and appropriated to serve the purpose of identity-politics. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Support from health care professionals (HCPs) with good knowledge and positive attitudes toward breastfeeding has been associated with better breastfeeding outcomes in the mothers of preterm infants. The aim of the study was to describe HCPs' experiences of a breastfeeding training program. A total of 48 specialist registered nurses, registered nurses, assistant nurses and physicians working at a neonatal intensive care unit attended a breastfeeding training program and answered a questionnaire including Likert scales and open-ended questions. The participants reported that their interest in breastfeeding had increased as a median (range) of 10 (8–10) on a 10-point scale and rated to what extent they had received new tools for breastfeeding support as a median of 10 (8–10) after training. There were no differences in the median between different professions' ratings. Qualitative content analysis of the open-ended questions resulted in two categories: Discussions of the case scenarios in the group and Knowledge regarding breastfeeding. The results showed that discussions based on breastfeeding scenarios were perceived as valuable; the health care professionals reported receiving new knowledge and useful practical skills. This program was shown to increase health care professionals’ interest in breastfeeding and is useful for different health care professions. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Objective. To assess the knowledge, practice, attitude, and preparedness of dental professionals in prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Methodology. A prevalidated voluntary web-based questionnaire was generated as a link through Google Drive and was sent to 117 dental professionals in North India using Whatsapp, Messenger, and Instagram social media platforms. A total of 94 responses were received and out of which 76 responses were analyzed (18 forms were excluded due to incomplete or duplicate responses). Frequency analysis was done using SPSS software version 21. Result. The participation rate was found to be 80.3%. More than half of the study population were familiar with the term NRT (77.6%) and its uses (67.1%), but approximately less than half of the total study subjects knew the duration (32.9%), cost (27.6%), dosage (25%), and contraindications (36.8%) of the NRT. Approximately 56.6% of the study participants showed a positive attitude towards helping patients to quit smoking through tobacco cessation counseling. Nearly one-fourth of the study population, i.e., 27.6%, were confident in explaining the negative impacts of tobacco, while 22.4% knew about the tobacco cessation protocol. Among the participants, only 27.6% reported that they practice NRT and out of which approximately less than 20% of the study participants were prescribing correct dose of NRT. Conclusion. Though study subjects had an ample knowledge regarding NRT use in tobacco cessation, it does not reflect their current attitude and preparedness. Thus, there is a need for continuing education to further train dental professionals for prescribing NRT. Copyright © 2022 Pratibha Taneja et al.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has major psychosocial consequences on the global population and specialists report that youth may be significantly impacted. Adolescents and young adults, for whom social life is an important protective factor, had to face a new isolation caused by social distancing and home schooling. This study aims to explore youth's profiles of adaptation to COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Quebec, Canada, and the risk factors and strengths associated with each profile. Methods: A sample of 4936 youth living in Quebec were recruited on social media and filled out an online survey during the lockdown of the first wave of COVID-19. They completed measures of psychological distress, positive adaptation (well-being, resilience), risk factors (alexithymia and emotional dysregulation), COVID-related worries and fear of contamination and COVID-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results: The results of the latent class analysis showed four patterns of adjustment. The Resilient group (36.6% of the sample) showed the highest probability of a positive adaptation. The High distress class (29.5%) reported clinical distress, low to moderate symptoms of PTSD and fear of contamination and no significant well-being. The Moderate symptoms class (17.55%) showed moderate levels of distress and COVID-related symptoms, with half of the group still showing significant well-being. The Traumatized class (16.35%) reported the worst adaptation. Correlates significantly differentiated profiles. Limitations: The study relied on a convenience sample and a cross-sectional design. Conclusion: Disentangling the diversity of adaptation profiles may orient more adapted resources for youth in need during this unprecedented crisis. © 2022

AB  - Past studies have shown that disease threat increases people's hostility towards immigrants. However, in our survey (N = 9571) conducted in five advanced Asian economies during the outbreak of COVID-19, we found that COVID-19 vulnerability was positively associated with support for immigration. Drawing on insight from policy feedback theories, we propose that the positive association is caused by the presence of widespread border crossing restrictions, which have changed the meaning and cost implications of COVID-19. As the outbreak expands, the pandemic has become not just a threat to people's health but also a barrier to globalization. Consequently, people who are worried about the disease may see globalization processes, including migration, as signs of pandemic relief. We find supportive evidence in our analysis. First, the positive association between COVID-19 vulnerability and support for immigration is more salient among respondents who considered restrictions on international travel to be stringent. Second, the positive association between COVID-19 vulnerability and immigration attitude was mediated by perceived economic threat from the pandemic and contribution by immigrants towards the containment of the pandemic. These findings suggest that disease control measures adopted at the global level may alter certain widely accepted effects of disease threat on immigration attitudes. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Despite the increasing awareness of digital games’ potential for language learning, only a handful of studies focus on their integration into classrooms. Informed by bridging activities, this mixed methods case study recruited six students to engage in instructed gameplay in class and game-related activities after class. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed so as to measure participants’ learning outcome, document their engagement, and explore their perceptions of game-based language learning. Results suggest progress in vocabulary recall and transfer. Participants also reported gains in writing and listening, satisfaction with the project, along with a positive attitude towards GBLL. Moreover, it is found that the instructor has a pivotal role to play in pre-game setup, in-game guidance, and post-game feedback. The study yields empirical evidence regarding the benefits of GBLL and may hold pedagogical implications for the integration of games into educational settings. The limitations of this research and future directions are also discussed. Copyright © 2022, IGI Global.

AB  - Despite the popularity of gamification among academics due to its propensity to promote student motivation, engagement, and behavioral change, its use in formal education is still limited. We reached out to educators at all levels to examine their experience, attitude, familiarity with gamified teaching, and their personality, to see if teachers’ personal characteristics are related to the intention of implementing gamified teaching. 118 in-service and 102 pre-service teachers completed the BFI-S and the questionnaire developed for the study. Teachers predominantly assumed that gamification represents game-based learning, and more than half reported using some game elements in at least one of their lectures. While in general participants were welcoming towards gamified teaching, experienced teachers had a more positive attitude toward gamification compared to pre-service teachers. Attitude was a mediator between the intention to use and a presumption that gamification means using educational games, experience with gamification, and openness. In addition, past use significantly predicted intention to use even when accounting for attitude. Both in-service and pre-service teachers expressed a wish to learn more about gamification. The study identified another gap between theory and practice, showing a need for teachers to be informed more regularly about the latest pedagogical strategies and approaches. © 2022,International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning.

AB  - Introduction The burden of chronic breathlessness on individuals, family, society and health systems is significant, and set to increase exponentially with population ageing, complex multimorbidity and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related disability. Breathlessness support services are effective; however, reach and access are limited. Delivering online breathlessness interventions may build capacity and resilience within health systems to tackle chronic breathlessness through supported self-management. The aim of this study was to explore accessibility and willingness of patients with chronic breathlessness to use an internet-based breathlessness self-management intervention (SELF-BREATHE). Methods Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with adults living with advanced malignant and non-malignant disease and chronic breathlessness (July to November 2020). Interviews were analysed using conventional and summative content analysis. Results 25 patients (COPD: n=13; lung cancer: n=8; interstitial lung disease (ILD): n=3; bronchiectasis: n=1) were interviewed: 17 male, median (range) age 70 (47–86) years and Medical Research Council dyspnoea score 3 (2–5). 21 patients had internet access. Participants described greater use, acceptance and normalisation of the internet since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. They described multifaceted internet use: functional, self-investment (improving health and wellbeing) and social. The concept of SELF-BREATHE was highly valued, and most participants with internet access were willing to use it. In addition to technical limitations, personal choice and perceived value of the internet were important factors that underpinned readiness to use online resources. Conclusion These findings suggest that patients living with chronic breathlessness that have access to the internet would have the potential to benefit from the online SELF-BREATHE intervention, if given the opportunity. © 2022, European Respiratory Society.

AB  - This study tests the effect of fake news awareness as an intervention strategy for motivating news verification behaviour among social media users in Nigeria. A quasi-experiment was utilized with 470 participants divided into two groups, comprising the control group, n = 235, and the treatment group, n = 235. Fake news awareness was found to be an effective intervention strategy used to intensify the urgency and need to verify news before sharing. Individuals exposed to fake news awareness campaigns reported a more positive attitude towards news verification, better self-efficacy towards verification and were more concerned about their reputation on social media. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Quarantine and social distancing are crucial factors in blocking the consequences of COVID-19 but also can lead to higher levels of loneliness and social isolation. Therefore, any advantages of mandatory quarantine have to be weighed against any negative impact on physical and mental well-being. This study aimed to examine the relationship between COVID-19-related fear and alcohol use during the lockdown period and loneliness as a mediating factor increasing the impact of COVID-19-related fear on alcohol use. A sample of 279 young adults completed self-reported questionnaires on COVID-19-related fear, loneliness, and substance use. This exploratory cross-sectional research was administered from 11 until December 18, 2020. The results showed that loneliness during lockdown mode may exacerbate the emotional burden caused by COVID-19-related fear leading to increased alcohol consumption as a coping mechanism against unsatisfactory living conditions. This study’s results reflect the need for societal groups, as well as health care services to remain specifically considerate to the needs of individuals who report high levels of COVID-19-related fear and loneliness. © 2022, Associação Brasileira de Psicologia.

AB  - Breastfeeding is the optimal source of infant nutrition, yet the motherʻs decision to breastfeed is complex and influenced by factors including social support and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes. This study employed a two-group pretest-posttest design to examine whether brief, online video presentations (<2.5 minutes in length) could improve breastfeeding knowledge and attitude among males and compare the outcomes between a knowledge-based and attitude-based intervention. Collegiate male participants (N = 213, 18–40 years of age) demonstrated high breastfeeding exposure (90.1% had friends/family breastfeed) and positive attitudes (89.2% accepted women could breastfeed and work outside home) yet knowledge deficits concerning breastfeeding health benefits were identified. Breastfeeding exposure was positively associated with baseline attitude (r(212)=.186, p =.006 and knowledge (r(212)=.229, p =.001. Both intervention groups reported similar gains in attitude scores; only the knowledge-based intervention reported significant gains in knowledge (M = 1.5, SD = 2.63 vs M = −.07, SD = 1.44, (t = −5.496, df = 211, p <.05). Brief online video presentations may constitute an additional exposure to or nudging toward breastfeeding, and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes can be positively influenced in young adult males with similar interventions that are affordable and require a minimal time commitment. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The stay-at-home orders of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted U.S. adolescents’ lives in numerous ways during the spring of 2020, including substantial changes to in-person routines and increased reliance on digital media. For adolescent girls, stay-at-home practices may have implications for body image concerns. In this research brief, we examine adolescent girls’ pandemic-related body image concerns and longitudinal associations with depressive symptoms. The sample included 93 U.S. adolescent girls (M age = 15.01; 68.8% White), with approximately 2/3 at temperamental risk for depression. Participants self-reported their depressive symptoms and pandemic-related body image concerns via online surveys at three assessments: Time 1 occurred in April/May 2020, approximately one month into stay-at-home orders, followed by two-week and seven-month follow-up assessments. Two pandemic-related body image concerns were assessed: (1) concerns about disrupted appearance-management routines and (2) evaluating one’s appearance on video-chat. Both forms of pandemic-related body image concerns predicted depressive symptoms two weeks later, and concerns about disrupted routines also predicted depressive symptoms seven months later. In an era of social distancing, frequent technology-based interactions, and disrupted routines, future work should continue to investigate adolescents’ body image concerns and the implications for longer-term mental health outcomes. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sexual and gender minorities often experience discrimination or stigmatization during health encounters. When patients feel stigmatized, they are more likely to delay seeking help and it affects patient cooperation and compliance, thus undermining therapeutic efficacy itself. We examined knowledge and attitude toward LGBT+ people among Hungarian (n = 743) and foreign (n = 130) medical students of the four Hungarian medical universities and 188 students from other faculties. Homonegativity and inadequate knowledge about sexual minority individuals are correlated with male gender, conservative political views, religiosity, religious behavior, and the absence of LGBT+ acquaintance. Medical students show more negative attitudes than students from other disciplines, although foreign medical students were more accepting than Hungarian program students. Further investigation of sexual minority-related content of the Hungarian medical education and revising the written and hidden curriculum would be desired, as well as collecting data from postgraduate students, physicians, and wide range of university faculties. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background and objective: During the COVID-19 pandemic, several aspects of life have been affected. These aspects have been impacted especially in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). The current study explored the overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life (QOL) domains in persons with SCI as well as evaluated their adherence to WHO-COVID 19-preventive measures. Design: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted after asking participants to complete an online validated Arabic version of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires including their demographics. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires were completed targeting two separate occasions to represent their scores prior to and during the pandemic. Participants were asked to rate their adherence to WHO-COVID-19 preventive measures on a 10-point scale. Setting and participants: 115 participants with complete/ incomplete SCI were recruited via social media and contacted by phone to complete the questionnaires. Results: Persons with SCI had lower QOL scores during the COVID-19 period compared to their QOL during the pre-COVID-19 period; all QOL domains (Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships, and Environment) showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001). Regarding COVID-19 preventative measures, participants were most likely to endorse self-isolation as well as staying home measures and least likely to adhere to hand washing and social distancing measures. Conclusion: The robustly reduced QOL reported by individuals with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rehabilitation and mental health services, particularly administered via telehealth, to buffer the effects of the pandemic. Additionally, psychoeducation and support regarding COVID-19 preventative behaviors in this region would be critical. © 2022, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread impact on the health sector worldwide, both in the clinical and research subsector. This has necessitated for the invention of protocols compliant with social distancing policies to efficiently tackle the current needs. Our aim is to describe a novel remote imaging technique, which helped us continue our research with widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (WF SS-OCTA). Patients and Methods: As a part of this cross-sectional observational study from August 2020 to September 2020 at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE), we used our institute approved remote desktop, outside of MEE, to gain full access to the on-site WF SS-OCTA device in the imaging room for the purpose of remote imaging. With only the patient being in the imaging room, effective communication was established via video conferencing on an encrypted tablet computer device for the entire procedure. Results: We imaged four patients with various retinal pathologies, aged 32–69 years. All images obtained were of high quality and signal strength (median score 9/10 for both) and all patients reported a highly satisfactory, comfortable, and safe experience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: This novel method is better for remote imaging compared to the previously described techniques as it is time and cost effective, requires limited resources without compromising the image quality or patient satisfaction and adheres to the various guidelines for infection control, most importantly social distancing. As a paradigm shift, this can also be employed in future for setups with limited staff like busy emergency departments or a rural setup with limited access or difficult commute, in the “new-normal” era. © 2022 Garg et al.

AB  - Although previous research has shown that deliberative discussions have consequences for intergroup attitudes, very little is known about this impact during the formative adolescent years. In addition, the mechanism explaining the mechanism through which discussions affect intergroup attitudes is not clear. This 3-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, MageT1 = 13.41, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of teacher-initiated political discussions in the classroom for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analysis showed that adolescents who perceived political discussions to be less frequent increased in anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth with more frequent discussions. Similarly, classrooms with less deliberative atmosphere were more negative toward immigrants than classrooms with a higher frequency of discussions, and this effect remained two years after the students moved to new schools. Mediation analysis revealed that general political interest (but not news consumption) explained the effects of classroom discussions on attitudes: Youth who perceived that their teachers frequently initiate political discussions developed higher general political interest and, in turn, lower anti-immigrant attitudes than youth with less frequent discussions. The findings show an important role of classroom political discussions for the formation of intergroup attitudes in adolescence. The findings suggest that frequent discussions reduce the risk of prejudice development by stimulating youth general political interest. © Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate radiologists’ education, knowledge and skills of research, attitude toward evidence-based radiology (EBR), understanding of terms and use of related published work in clinical practice and the association between these variables and sociodemographic characteristics. We also aim to assess the availability of resources and to identify sources and the main barriers to implementing EBR. Materials and Methods: A total of 87 radiologists completed a questionnaire, which consisted of eight sections related to radiologists’ demographic characteristics, and EBR-related questions. Descriptive statistics were used, and the association between EBR-related parts and sociodemographic characteristics was performed. Results: Ninety-three percent of the radiologists believed that EBR is necessary in practice. Only 40% received formal training in search strategies and 29.9% in critical appraisal of research literature during academic preparation. Moreover, 21–62% of the respondents completely understand specific terms related to EBR. Sixty-three percent stated that they can access relevant databases and the Internet at workplace. Research articles were only used by 24% to make a clinical decision. Almost 50% reported that they read or reviewed ≤1 article per month. The primary barrier to implementing EBR was the lack of colleagues’ support. Understanding terms and the number of articles used in clinical decision were significantly related to education (P-value=0.001, 0.007) and hospital section (P-value=0.002, 0.027) respectively. Conclusion: Radiologists showed positive attitude toward EBR. However, there is a lack in information resources, colleagues’ support, use of published literature, understanding of research terms and the ability of radiologists to access relevant databases at workplaces. © 2022 Alakhras et al.

AB  - Bisexuality remains a stereotyped sexual identity in which bisexuals face prejudice from both gay/lesbian and heterosexual populations. Some bisexual individuals internalize society’s negative attitudes, resulting in an experience of self-stigma. Consequently, many bisexual individuals report a reduced sense of belonging. The current study explored whether self-stigma mediates the association between experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice and a sense of belonging within a bisexual sample (n = 529) while also identifying how experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice vary as a function of participant gender (man, woman, non-binary) and the source of prejudice (gay/lesbian or heterosexual). Self-stigma fully mediated the association between anti-bisexual experiences and a sense of belonging. Women and non-binary individuals reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences than men, and all participants reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences from heterosexual versus gay/lesbian sources. Efforts to improve a sense of belonging among bisexual individuals should focus on reducing anti-bisexual prejudice and anti-bisexual self-stigma. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between self-sacrifice and hope as well as the possible intervening roles of perceived family support and attitudes to aging in this relationship among Chinese older adults. A total of 475 older adults participated in the current study. They completed measures related to self-sacrifice, hope, perceived family support, and attitudes to aging. Attitudes to aging measured the extent to which older adults hold positive and negative attitudes toward aging in three domains of physical change, psychological growth, and psychosocial loss. The results showed that self-sacrifice was positively associated with older adults’ hope. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived family support mediated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that attitudes to physical change moderated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope, and attitudes to psychological growth moderated the relationship between perceived family support and older adults’ hope. Specifically, the association between self-sacrifice and hope was stronger for older adults with less positive attitudes to physical change than for those with more positive attitudes to physical change. The association between perceived family support and hope was stronger for older adults with more positive attitudes to psychological growth than for those with less positive attitudes to psychological growth. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between self-sacrifice and hope and can aid in designing effective interventions aimed at improving older adults’ hope. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Indian students in Britain before the Second World War were a sizeable social group who exerted noticeable influence on Indian nationalism and on British institutions and society. The politics of race and empire were mediated through British schools and universities in this period with consequences for Indian students, and their peers. This article discusses the ways in which Indian students were socially segregated in Britain, including facing a colour ban in some parts of the country, and the consequences of this racial prejudice. It argues that the mobility of colonial students during the time of empire not only had a personal effect on their lives, but encouraged them to become politically engaged in the politics of metropole and empire, engaging in nationalism, socialism and the female suffrage movement in both Britain and India. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Due to social distancing measures implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are spending more time isolated at home with limited physical social interactions. The current study investigated whether marriage and/or cohabitation is associated with satisfaction with life and depression among 732 adult same-sex twin pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic) in the US using online survey data. Twin analysis showed that married and/or cohabiting individuals were more satisfied with life and less depressed than those not married and/or cohabiting. The association between marriage and/or cohabiting and satisfaction with life was not confounded by between-family factors, whereas that between depression was mediated by familial factors. These findings suggest that being in a close relationship may mitigate some of the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Close relationships may be an essential source of support as individuals rely on their intimate partners when faced with the uncertainty and stress of the pandemic. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The paper focuses on Facebook's shaping of communication regarding the European migrant crisis in the Czech Republic. Topological spaces in communication with entanglements of inclusion and exclusion were produced by practicing the communication, with the mutual influence of two kinds of the collective unconscious, the technological and the Orientalist unconscious. The paper is based on a participant observation of Czech-language Facebook groups and pages where discussions about the European migrant crisis proliferated. Due to the technological unconscious, algorithm-induced “filter-bubbles” helped to separate discussions of different opinions about migration so people with anti-immigration attitudes could be building European free-thinking people identities who distrust mainstream media, and people with pro-migration attitudes were excluded and considered trustful “sheeple”. Due to the Orientalist unconscious, European free-thinking people identities were strengthened by the sharing of ideas about uncivilized, irrational, and barbaric imaginative spaces of migrants' origin, which were entirely Other to Europe. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Although research demonstrates significant stigma toward individuals with mental illness, the relative importance of observed behavior and a psychiatric diagnosis in eliciting stigma remains poorly understood. Using video vignettes, two experiments (ns = 195 and 749) examined the effect of irritable (vs. calm) behavior and the presence (vs. absence) of a schizophrenia diagnosis on attitudinal, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of stigma toward a fictitious emergency room patient seeking migraine treatment. In line with labeling theory, irritable behavior resulted in greater blameworthy attributions for behavior, greater fear and anger, and less caring emotions. A psychiatric diagnosis increased endorsement of other stigmatizing attributions (e.g., substance use) as a reason for behavior. Behavior and diagnosis both resulted in patients being rated as less warm, competent, and predictable, and more dangerous. These independent variables also interacted to predict desire for social distance. A calm, nondiagnosed patient elicited the lowest desire for distance, an irritable patient with or without a diagnosis elicited equally high desire for distance, and a calm, diagnosed patient elicited moderate desire for distance. Mediational analyses show that dangerousness and fear may mediate the effect of a diagnosis on desire for distance. In all, results suggest both diagnostic labels and behavior result in stigma via different attitudinal and emotional mechanisms, and that individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis face stigma even if behaving calmly. By enriching understanding of the relative importance of aberrant behavior and a psychiatric diagnosis on multiple dimensions of mental illness stigma, this work has implications for antistigma interventions. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Biodiversity conservation in Aotearoa New Zealand is of high importance, and efforts to protect vulnerable populations from decline has garnered broad public support. Conservation efforts have been further highlighted with the 2016 announcement of Predator Free 2050, a nationwide goal to eliminate key invasive mammalian predators from New Zealand by the year 2050. Hands-on labour is often needed to complete conservation initiatives, and New Zealand conservation volunteers have shown themselves to be an abundant, effective, and oft-used workforce. However, there is limited knowledge of conservation volunteers on a national scale. This exploratory research aimed to determine what motivates conservation volunteers in New Zealand, gauge their attitudes toward modern-day conservation, and summarise their demographic information. Through a nationwide survey of 986 New Zealand conservation volunteers in 2018, we found that they have a higher than median age, income, education, and are predominantly Pākehā/NZ European and likely retired. The median conservation volunteer has volunteered within 10 km of home for 10 hours a month for 6 years. The conservation and cultural context in New Zealand could be reflected in volunteer motivations and attitudes. New Zealand conservation volunteers are motivated by a feeling of responsibility, with some referencing the Māori concept of kaitiakitanga. There were elements of wanting to right past wrongs and volunteers’ perceived role as stewards of their local environment. Conservation volunteers overwhelmingly agree with the stated goals of Predator Free 2050 and are in favour of current and potential future methods of pest control. They are, however, significantly less confident that Predator Free 2050 goals will be achieved. Conservation volunteers contribute to goals like Predator Free 2050 through their significant voluntary labour. We hope this research contributes to a better understanding of conservation volunteers in New Zealand and leads to strengthening the support for these volunteers and the many community groups they represent. © 2022 NewvolunteersZealand Ecological Society.

AB  - Hate speech recognizers (HSRs) can be the panacea for containing hate in social media or can result in the biggest form of prejudice-based censorship hindering people to express their true selves. In this paper, we hypothesized how massive use of syntax can reduce the prejudice effect in HSRs. To explore this hypothesis, we propose Unintended-bias Visualizer based on Kermit modeling (KERM-HATE): a syntax-based HSR, which is endowed with syntax heat parse trees used as a post-hoc explanation of classifications. KERM-HATE significantly outperforms BERT-based, RoBERTa-based and XLNet-based HSR on standard datasets. Surprisingly this result is not sufficient. In fact, the post-hoc analysis on novel datasets on recent divisive topics shows that even KERM-HATE carries the prejudice distilled from the initial corpus. Therefore, although tests on standard datasets may show higher performance, syntax alone cannot drive the ‘‘attention“ of HSRs to ethically-unbiased features. © 2022 Mastromattei et al.

AB  - Despite commitments by the Arabian Gulf countries to promote gender equality and policies of nondiscrimination against women, the underrepresentation of women in the political sphere remains unchanged. Using the case of the Sultanate of Oman, this paper endeavors to analyze the reasons behind the persistent political disempowerment of women in the Middle East and North African region through the lens of public opinion. The findings are based on 288 surveys conducted with two groups of participants – a group of undergraduate and postgraduate students majoring in political science, and a group of Omani citizens with no political education. These findings confirm the impact of both formal (government driven) and informal (socio-cultural) factors resulting in the low level of political empowerment of Omani women. By exploring public opinion formed towards women’s political empowerment in the country, it was observed that respondents who majored in political science demonstrated a lower degree of gender bias compared to citizens with no education in political science. Socio-demographic variables such as the age and level of education of both groups did not show any significant impact on either reducing or increasing gender bias. However, a positive correlation between gender and citizens’ opinions was observed. While politically educated respondents, regardless of their gender, maintained a positive attitude towards women and their participation in politics, male respondents from the general public group exhibited elevated levels of bias against the need for women’s political empowerment. The study shows that gender bias is neutralized when mediated by the variable of political awareness. The findings also suggest that an increase in the level of political awareness among citizens might be considered as a positive intervention needed for changing public opinion in favour of the political empowerment of women. © 2022

AB  - The news media is a major contributor to stigmatizing beliefs that people with mental illness are dangerous and should be avoided. To reduce stigma, it is critical to understand how to reduce the negative impact from stories about violence and mental illness. This study experimentally manipulated elements of a TV news report to explore the effect on stigma. Participants were 838 community adults, mainly from the U.K. and USA, who were randomized to one of two versions of a TV news report describing a violent crime in which the perpetrator has a severe mental illness, one containing additional stigmatizing elements and the other elements thought to mitigate against stigma. Participants completed a variety of stigma outcome measures designed to assess beliefs about dangerousness, fear, and desire for social distance. The effect of the news condition upon stigma was mixed. While several effects were in the expected direction favoring the mitigating condition, these effects were very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, participants in the mitigating condition showed significantly lower prosocial beliefs and greater perceived difference from people with mental illness than the stigmatizing condition. Exploratory analyses suggested that country may have moderated effects. In conclusion, we could not reliably detect a difference between the two versions of the TV news report on stigmatizing outcomes. Further novel research is needed to build the evidence base of how to improve TV reporting of stories involving people with severe mental illness in the context of violent crime. © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - Prejudices against minorities are amplified by distorted media coverage that highlights these groups disproportionally in crime coverage. But while the specifications of alleged criminals’ affiliations to minority groups—so-called minority signification—has been studied after key events and between outlets, no research has yet investigated changes over a longer time, including different key events and outlets. Using a partly automated content analysis, our research fills this gap with a case study of minority signification in Germany from 2014 to 2019. We show that first, culturally more distant nationalities are slightly overrepresented while European nationalities are underrepresented in crime news compared with German crime statistics. Second, some spikes in the data could be linked to key events but others remain unexplained. Third, the political-right newspaper mentions minority affiliations most, the tabloid second, and the political-left outlet mentions them least. Surprisingly, this pattern changes over the years. © 2022 (Azade Esther Kakavand and Damian Trilling).

AB  - Voting resulted in pioneering knowledge about the political attitudes and behaviors of ordinary people, as well as of methods for study of political process. Paul Lazarsfeld and his team found that voters were not the rational decision makers of economic theory, but neither were they puppets manipulated in mass society. Voters are social beings as influenced by their social milieu and peers as they are with regard to other social and cultural preferences and behaviors. The 1948 election in U.S. politics was fought on longstanding and stable socioeconomic cleavages. Multiculturalism, identity politics, and racial justice were not on the political agenda. Lazarsfeld was mindful that ideological issues might lead to antidemocratic tendencies, as in 1930s Europe.

AB  - Introduction: The main entry point for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention, care, and treatment is through HIV testing services. Despite undeniable benefits and increased availability of HIV testing services, uptake remains low among students. The purpose of the study was to determine factors contributing to low HIV testing services uptake among tertiary students in a university in South Africa. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among tertiary students to determine factors contributing to low HIV testing services uptake. A total of 306 eligible students from the School of Health Sciences in a South African university were selected through a systematic random sampling technique. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Ethical considerations were ensured throughout the study. Results: Findings of the study showed that out of 306 respondents, 204 (67%) were females and 102 (33%) males. The majority (68%, n = 208) of the students were between the age of 18 and 24 years. About 135 (44%) respondents were tested for HIV as compared to 171 (56%) who were not tested. Respondents showed good knowledge about HIV testing services (HTS), and their attitude was positive. HIV and AIDS-related stigma, fear of potential HIV-positive results, and negative attitude of healthcare service providers were cited as contributory factors to low uptake of HTS. Conclusions: Despite the adequate knowledge about HTS and high awareness campaigns, HIV uptake of HTS remained low among the respondents. Therefore, the use of various forms of media, including campus radio and newsletters to promote uptake of HTS among university students is recommended. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - In this article, we present Ear Talk-a co-composition and live performance project that enables remote music collaboration through technologically mediated systems. The Ear Talk project currently exists in two distinct implementations, one that repurposes YouTube's live-streaming technology, and one that utilises a stand-alone website. Although Ear Talk was conceived prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity for remote collaboration became more apparent during the lockdown, when a vast majority of live events and music concerts were cancelled. The Ear Talk project enables a socially distanced form of online musical collaboration and offers a platform through which to respond to such a crisis, and has grown to be adopted and presented by many different performing groups across the world. In addition to describing the technical implementations of these two systems, we discuss issues that arise from our participatory practice: from musical quality concerns in regard to social aesthetics and artistic ingenuity, to accessibility concerns when designing technologically mediated collaborative systems. Ear Talk embraces continuous musical loops as well as highly asynchronous (i.e., perpetual) collaborative paradigms among remote participants, which raises a conceptual inquiry as to which part of its sonic and social experience constitutes music in the end. Finally, we evaluate performer-audience relationships (i.e., hierarchical versus horizontal interactions) and the efficacy of the Ear Talk systems at enabling socially engaged co-composition. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - This paper investigates gender differences in political participation across 10 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using data from the World Values Survey (2010-2014). A distinction is made between two different participation types, institutional and non-institutional. We use an ordered logit model to evaluate whether the gender gap in both forms is mediated by demographic and attitudinal controls and assess whether variables influencing participation affect men and women differently. We find that most socioeconomic resources and political attitudes are correlated with higher levels of participation. However, the analysis reveals a persistent gender gap that can be generalized to the entire spectrum of engagement in the MENA, with larger gaps for less institutionalized forms. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The LGBTQ+ panic defense is a provocation defense strategy used to attain a lesser sentence for the defendant. It is often used by cisgender straight men to provide reasoning for a violent reaction to an unwanted sexual advance from an LGBTQ+ individual. Existing empirical work has examined juror perceptions of the LGBTQ+ panic defense used against gay victims, but lacks investigation of instances when the victim identifies as transgender. Utilizing a sample of 233 undergraduate students, we examine how mock jurors’ individual characteristics (political orientation, masculine honor beliefs, and prejudices) influence victim perceptions (negative affect and blame) as well as verdict decisions in three different defense scenarios (transgender panic defense, transsexual panic defense, and neutral provocation defense). As predicted, participants exposed to trans panic defenses rendered more lenient verdicts compared to the control condition. Mediation analyses revealed that mock jurors with higher masculine honor beliefs and a more conservative political ideology expressed more negative affect toward the victim, leading to more lenient verdict decisions. Additionally, a path analysis revealed verdict to be double mediated by negative affect and victim blame. Legislation to ban the use of LGBTQ+ defenses has been accepted in some U.S. states and two countries, but it is still legal in a majority of U.S. states and worldwide. Therefore, it is important that research examines claims being made about the nature of the defense strategy. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE) refers to individuals responding more negatively to criticism directed toward their ingroup if the criticism is delivered by someone outside the group. The ISE has never been examined for groups defined by race. In light of ongoing racial tensions in America, the purpose of the current research was to examine whether the ISE replicates among racial groups. Study 1 replicated the ISE among African American, European American, and Latinx American university students and, unexpectedly, found that European American participants responded more positively to praise delivered by a racial outgroup member. Study 2 replicated these results in a nonstudent sample and identified motivation to respond without prejudice as a moderator of the praise effect. In both studies, the ISE was mediated by perceptions of comment legitimacy/constructiveness but was not moderated by feelings toward the outgroup. Future directions and explanations for the praise effect are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) continuous infusions or intermittent boluses are used for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Intermittent boluses are easier to give and are of lower cost without affecting clinical outcomes. Objective: To compare the rate of rebleeding between intermittent bolus and continuous infusion PPI therapy. Methods: We performed a retrospective, multicenter review of patients with UGIB receiving either continuous or intermittent PPI therapy. During the study period, due to drug and supply shortages, each institution implemented policies preferring intermittent PPI bolus therapy. We performed bivariate and multivariable comparisons of the 2 treatment strategies, with the primary outcome of interest being incidence of rebleeding. Additional variables of interest included intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay, discharge disposition, and in-hospital mortality. Results: Compared with intermittent bolus dosing (n = 209), patients receiving continuous infusion PPI (n = 237) were associated with a higher rate of rebleeding (33.8% vs 23.0%; P = 0.012); however, no difference was detected in multivariable analysis: adjusted odds ratio, 1.50 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.50). There was no difference in median hospital or ICU length of stay, discharge disposition, or in-hospital mortality. Correlatively, patients receiving continuous infusion therapy were more likely to have liver disease (29.1% vs 20.1%; P = 0.028), alcohol use disorder (28.3% vs 16.3.%; P = 0.003), history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (6.4% vs 1.9%; P = 0.021), variceal bleeding (6.3 vs 2.4%, P = 0.045), and be admitted to the ICU (65.0% vs 32.5%, P = 0.00). Conclusions: Introduction of intermittent PPI bolus UGIB treatment via change in hospital policy was not associated with higher rates of rebleeding. However, continuous PPI therapy may have been perceived as more effective as it was used more commonly in high-risk patients. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Drones, a small aviation craft that can hold sensors and be directed to certain locations, have been explored and utilized in domains such as public safety, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. Yet, the scientific research of drone usage still in progress. This article investigates the following: (1) how the public perceives a drone as a healthcare tool, and (2) what the concerns are of public acceptance of drones in healthcare. A qualitative approach with demographic questions such as participants' age, education level, current knowledge of drones, as well as willingness to learn about the technology was used. The contribution is to have an understanding of how the public perceives drones. The results can be used in enhancing public views of drones through skilled personnel and an educated workforce. In a conservative community such as Saudi Arabia, the public holds a relatively positive attitude towards drones. Respondents are aware of such technology from different sources, mainly TV news. Informants also did show a decent level of perceived beneficial usage of drones in healthcare. There are few participants who disclosed concerns of safety, security, and privacy for the usage of drones in healthcare due to a lack of knowledge about the technology. The results propose that government and industry stakeholders should invest more in increasing public awareness of technology. Media coverage will likely influence the public view and help the community move forward. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Effective pandemic management requires understanding the level of community knowledge, attitudes of people, and preparedness towards COVID-19. This study aimed to assess gender differences regarding knowledge, attitudes and preparedness toward the COVID-19, among Bangladeshi adults. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted March– April 2020 among 1050 Bangladeshi adults. A convenience sampling strategy was utilized, and the data were collected online through a self-administered questionnaire. Chisquared tests were used to identify the gender differences regarding knowledge, attitudes and preparedness towards COVID-19. RESULTS Respondents predominately used social media to inform themselves about COVID-19 (68.1%), and females used social media more than males (p<0.001). Females had higher levels of correct knowledge about staying home with sickness and symptoms to prevent the COVID-19 transmission (p=0.02). Males had a more negative attitude about staying out during the pandemic than females (p<0.001); men were less likely to take preventative measures than their female counterparts. Some people believed in misinformation like ‘COVID-19 can transmit via mosquitos’ (9.1%), and males had more incorrect knowledge regarding this (p<0.001). Moreover, 17.8% of the respondents thought that COVID-19 could spread in warm weather. CONCLUSIONS Males showed a higher tendency to believe the myths about COVID-19 than their female counterparts, which is alarming. Awareness programs should be emphasized, focusing on gender-specific pertinent information to ensure effective preventative measures. © 2022 Sultana M. S. et al.

AB  - Islamophobia is a sentiment against the Muslim community; recently, atrocities towards Muslim communities witnessed this sentiment globally. This research investigates the correlation between how news stories covered by mainstream news channels impede the hate speech/Islamophobic sentiment. To examine the objective mentioned above, we shortlisted thirteen mainstream news channels and the ten most widely reported Islamophobic incidents across the globe for experimentation. Transcripts of the news stories are scraped along with their comments, likes, dislikes, and recommended videos as the users’ responses. We used a word embedding technique for sentiment analysis, e.g., Islamophobic or not, three textual variables, video titles, video transcripts, and comments. This sentiment analysis helped to compute metric variables. The I-score represents the extent of portrayals of Muslims in a particular news story. The next step is to calculate the canonical correlation between video transcripts and their respective responses, explaining the relationship between news portrayal and hate speech. This study provides empirical evidence of how news stories can promote Islamophobic sentiments and eventually atrocities towards Muslim communities. It also provides the implicit impact of reporting news stories that may impact hate speech and crime against speciﬁc communities. Copyright 2022 Ali et al.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique opportunity to answer the critical question: How does media use aid (or subvert) emotion and problem-focused coping with significant life stressors? Based on a national survey (N = 564) conducted on March 20–25, 2020, the week after COVID-19 was declared a U.S. national emergency, evidence offered strong support for the use and value of media, entertainment media in particular, as key aids to coping processes. Looking across a range of coping techniques, only TV/movie and music consumption emerged as a significant mediator between stress and coping efficacy, which, in turn, was significantly associated with social distancing likelihood. These and other results provide evidence for the important role that media consumption can play in supporting coping processes in ways both unique from more basic emotional regulation and beyond techniques typically recommended by health professionals. © 2022.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 and its subsequent social distancing policies have profoundly impacted the lives of parents and children. Prolonged exposure to parenting-related responsibilities and heightened levels of family conflict under stay-at-home orders coupled with reduced access to support systems and resources have rendered parents and children more prone to stress and mental health difficulties. Drawing on a transactional model of parent–child interactions, the present study applied an actor–partner interdependence model approach to examine the transactional relationship between COVID-19-related stress and mental well-being among parents and children. Data from 109 Chinese parent–child dyads in Hong Kong were included in the study. Parents and their 8- to 10-year-old children completed a questionnaire on COVID-19-related stress, parent–child relationships, and mental well-being. The results showed that 53.2% and 30.3% of the parents and children, respectively, showed poor mental well-being, indicating possible emotional problems. Both actor and partner effects of parent COVID-19-related stress were found. Parent COVID-19-related stress was indirectly related to lower levels of parent and child mental well-being, through the mediation of parent–child conflict. To facilitate psychological adjustment following the COVID-19 outbreak, effective family-based mental health and parenting interventions are needed to promote family cohesion and alleviate stress-induced psychological symptoms. Even in the time of social distancing, telepsychotherapy and other online non-psychotherapeutic interventions can serve as a valid alternative for parents and children who experience excessive distress. Implications for psychological services, family-friendly policies, and social protection measures are also discussed. © 2022 Family Process Institute

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines are one of the most effective preventive strategies for containing the pandemic. Having a better understanding of the public’s conceptions of COVID-19 vaccines may aid in the effort to promptly and thoroughly vaccinate the community. However, because no empirical research has yet fully explored the public’s vaccine awareness through sentiment–based topic modeling, little is known about the evolution of public attitude since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: In this study, we specifically focused on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson) after vaccines became publicly available. We aimed to explore the overall sentiments and topics of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, as well as how such sentiments and main concerns evolved. Methods: We collected 1,122,139 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from December 14, 2020, to April 30, 2021, using Twitter’s application programming interface. We removed retweets and duplicate tweets to avoid data redundancy, which resulted in 857,128 tweets. We then applied sentiment–based topic modeling by using the compound score to determine sentiment polarity and the coherence score to determine the optimal topic number for different sentiment polarity categories. Finally, we calculated the topic distribution to illustrate the topic evolution of main concerns. Results: Overall, 398,661 (46.51%) were positive, 204,084 (23.81%) were negative, 245,976 (28.70%) were neutral, 6899 (0.80%) were highly positive, and 1508 (0.18%) were highly negative sentiments. The main topics of positive and highly positive tweets were planning for getting vaccination (251,979/405,560, 62.13%), getting vaccination (76,029/405,560, 18.75%), and vaccine information and knowledge (21,127/405,560, 5.21%). The main concerns in negative and highly negative tweets were vaccine hesitancy (115,206/205,592, 56.04%), extreme side effects of the vaccines (19,690/205,592, 9.58%), and vaccine supply and rollout (17,154/205,592, 8.34%). During the study period, negative sentiment trends were stable, while positive sentiments could be easily influenced. Topic heatmap visualization demonstrated how main concerns changed during the current widespread vaccination campaign. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate public COVID-19 vaccine awareness and awareness trends on social media with automated sentiment–based topic modeling after vaccine rollout. Our results can help policymakers and research communities track public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and help them make decisions to promote the vaccination campaign. ©Luwen Huangfu, Yiwen Mo, Peijie Zhang, Daniel Dajun Zeng, Saike He.

AB  - Background: The world began to realise the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in January 2020, and since then the number of people infected has exceeded 1 million globally. In less than 1 month following the first reported case in Nigeria, over 180 people had tested positive to the disease. Studies have shown that such rapidly spreading infectious diseases have the potential to create widespread fear, apprehension, panic and anxiety amongst the general public. Aim: This study aimed at evaluating the impact of information dissemination and public mental healthcare needs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. It also hopes to determine if there is an unmet need for telepsychiatry in Nigeria. Setting: Community-based study covering the North, South and West of Nigeria. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study using an on-line survey form via the snowballing sampling method. Results: Social media was identified as the main source of information concerning COVID-19, and half of the respondents opined that information dissemination was inadequate. Psychological distress was present in 90.5% of the participants and 61.8% admitted that this distress was worsened by fake news and myths concerning COVID-19. However, 53.8% of the participants were willing to access mental healthcare services, with telepsychiatry being the preferred choice. Conclusion: There is a need to implement a national public mental health service during this emergency. Telepsychiatry has numerous advantages in this context and maybe an opportunity to roll out a novel means of delivering mental healthcare. © 2022. The Authors.

AB  - This article sheds light on how adults in Barcelona (ES), Groningen (NL), and Milan (IT) utilized WhatsApp to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interactions and to fight social isolation during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 lockdown. We argue that practices of WhatsApp usage have multiplied and diversified experiences of co-presence at distance and made group socialities even more important than before. Building on the concepts of “scalable socialities” and “polymedia,” the article formulates the concept of “scalable co-presence” to account for ways in which WhatsApp has enabled multiple experiences of proximity to others across different scales of sociality, from one-to-one to large groups interactions. In this article, we also argue that the concept of “scalable co-presence” is relevant to bring the study of mediated co-presence out of media and migration studies into the broader field of media and cultural studies. With reduction in mobility, increased social distancing, and ubiquitous connectivity, the role of communication technologies in mediating proximity at distance has become crucial for many more people around the world outside the context of transnational migration. The concept is also relevant to acknowledge the increased importance of mediated group interactions and communications in (post)-pandemic digital societies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: The authors investigated the role of cultural (i.e. traditional and religious) values in predicting the relationships between the attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and the purchase intention for sustainable apparel. Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was conducted in Amazon Mechanical Turk with the millennials of the US (n = 317). The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The connection with indigenous cultural values in terms of the (1) traditional values positively influenced attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion; (2) religious values positively influenced attitude toward slow fashion but did not influence attitude toward the environment. (3) Both attitudes towards environment and slow fashion positively influenced purchase intention for sustainable apparel. (4) The connection with cultural values did not influence purchase intention toward sustainable apparel directly; however, (5) attitude toward slow fashion mediated the relationship between connection with cultural values and purchase intention for sustainable apparel both in terms of traditional and religious values, and (6) attitude toward the environment mediated the relationship between connection with traditional values and purchase intention for sustainable apparel. Practical implications: Instead of focusing only on pro-environmental messages, marketers should use culture-specific cues to evoke favorable attitudinal and behavioral responses toward sustainable apparel. Social implications: Advertisement cues of sustainable apparel imbuing the target market's cultural values could help in protecting culturally significant elements of nature in the long-term by evoking positive attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and encouraging purchase intention for sustainable apparel in the short-term. Originality/value: The authors indicated the importance of indigenous cultural values in shaping favorable attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and purchase intention for sustainable apparel. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In an effort to stave off racial and geographic prejudices, The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against naming pathogens for geographic regions. Despite this, some media reports, and prominent politicians, have persisted in calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus,” or some variant thereof. In this pre-registered online experiment (N = 614), we examined the effect media frames and individual factors (i.e., political affiliation and party) had on perceptions of COVID-19, prejudice against Chinese- and Asian-Americans, and attributing blame to China for the coronavirus. We found that articles that labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus” (versus the “COVID-19 Virus”) were perceived less favorably by Democrats and liberals, in comparison to Republicans and conservatives, who were also more likely to express greater racial prejudice against Chinese- and Asian-Americans and to blame China for the pandemic. Findings from this study suggest that amongst a host of other variables, media framing has an effect on the public’s attitudes and feelings of blame for the pandemic. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Two survey studies, one with a college sample (Study 1, n = 245) and one with a national U.S. adult sample (Study 2, n = 590) examined how media messages can influence attitudes toward Black people in the U.S. A novel contribution is the role of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, or the belief that members of an outgroup are likely to return a favor (positive), or enact retribution for a wrong (negative) as a factor in the relationship between television use and attitudes. Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - One of the ways to overcome the sheer devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic is to get vaccinated. However, vaccine hesitancy could be a significant barrier. The main purposes of the current study are to examine the impact of four types of theory-driven messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention and to understand the moderating role of partisan media use and vaccination attitudes. The study used a between-subject randomized online experiment with four conditions. The manipulation messages were presented as screenshots from the CDC’s Facebook page. The total number of participants were 387 (female 43%, mean age 37 years). The participants were from the U.S. and older than 18 years. The findings show that loss vs. gain message frames did not have any impact on COVID-19 vaccine intention. The moderating effects of conservative media and attitudes show that in general, those who consumed lower conservative media and held positive attitudes were higher on vaccine intention, and individual vs. collective frames did not have a strong impact. However, among those participants who scored high on conservative media use, and held negative vaccination attitudes, the individual frame had a higher impact on vaccine intention. The current study experimentally tested the intertwined relationships among message frames, partisan media use, and attitudes on vaccine intention. These relationships are critical considering the political nature of the pandemic. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study reports on an analysis of user-generated comments in response to a newspaper article criticising an overwhelmingly Anglicised user interface in self-ordering kiosks in South Korea. A total of 1,206 comments were subjected to qualitative analysis to identify salient themes reflecting the public’s attitudes towards the practice and desirable adjustments. The results showed polarised responses, with ‘strongly nationalistic’ language attitudes at one extreme and rather lenient, albeit not actively supportive, ‘why not?’ attitudes at the other, indicating tension between the ideologies underlying the accommodation or denial of the necessity of English. The coexistence of resistance to the practice (79.7%) and the heated pursuit of English on a national level defies the general scholarly observation that unfavourable views of a language obstruct its vitality in society. The public’s attitude towards the phenomenon of excessive Anglicisation appears to be driven largely by the ideology of externalisation rather than the pervasive neoliberal necessitation authorising English as the lingua franca of the globalising world. Although the contingent nature of language attitudes is indicated, the overall findings suggest a transition in attitudes towards the use of English, from perceiving it as a status symbol to viewing it as an unedifying manifestation of linguistic dandyism. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article focuses on a particular group in capitalist society that is disabled, demeaned and denied by capitalism itself, through processes of economic exploitation, systematic and systemic class exclusion, and discrimination/ prejudice-that is-the working class. In doing so I recognise that the working class (defined as all those who sell their/our labour power) is segmented horizontally into `layers’, or strata (for example, the dispossessed, unemployed, unskilled, though to the supervisory. managerial level/stratum) and also vertically, for example, by `race’and by gender, with particular ethnic groups, and women in general, disabled and oppressed and exploited to a greater degree than their/ our white, male sisters and brothers). Analysing from a Classical Marxist perspective I address the structures of the capitalist state through which this exclusion and `subalternising’ is imposed, through formal state structures such as education, media, the panoply of state force and class law, as well as through the material power of the capitalist class, expressed through, for example, wage suppression and enforced immiseration of the majority of the working class. In doing so I address two types of neo-Marxist analysis-`Structuralist neo-Marxism’ and ‘Culturalist neo-Marxism’, and the dialectical relationship between them. They differ on such matters as: the degree of `relative autonomy' for resistant agency; the relative impact and import of cultural-ideological as against structural-material analysis; and the salience or not of social class analysis, the Capital-Labour relation, vis-a vis other forms of oppression such as `race; and gender', and their implications for political resistance and organisation at the cultural-ideological level and at the level of power, the material power to reform and revolutionise economic and social relations of Capital. I propose an activist programme of resistance at two levels. Firstly, societal level, looking at Marxists such as Marx and Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky and the dialectical relationship between Reform and Revolution. Secondly, at the level of Education, both formal and informal (through social movements, political parties, trade unions, through public pedagogy for example). Within the formal education structures, I advance specific proposals regarding schooling and teacher education. This is a panoptic paper-the issues above are linked in terms of Classical Marxist analysis of capitalism, class exploitation and oppression, and the implications of such analysis for the praxis and politics of resistance. © 2022, Institute for Education Policy Studies.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the role that teachers play in preventing the expression of blatant and subtle prejudice among students. Using a self-reported survey conducted in the south of France, we investigated the attitudes of 1,858 middle and high school students. Multivariate analyses show that when students see their teachers addressing issues about racism, discrimination and cultural diversity in the classroom, their attitudes of intolerance decrease. Nevertheless, mediation and moderation models highlight the existence of external factors, such as the parents’ educational attainment, that affect the students’ capacity to internalise their teachers’ discourse. Contrary to our expectations, the students’ level of trust in the education system has no significant influence on their perception of the effectiveness of teacher interventions. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social distancing to limit the spread of COVID-19 poses a unique psychological challenge, especially in light of evidence for the importance of even minimal cues of inclusion. In a German (N = 546) and a US (N = 199) sample, we examined the impact of work-related social distancing on the outcomes of ostracism, measuring need fulfillment in self-esteem, belonging, control, and meaning. Overall, social distancing was associated with decreased need fulfillment. German participants reported a higher need fulfillment compared to American participants. Compared to previous studies, social distancing impacted self-related need fulfillment less than experimental manipulations of ostracism, however more so than the baseline condition of inclusion. Working, while social distancing was associated with greater need fulfillment, as was identifying as male. Women reported lower need fulfillment overall and this difference was mediated by the need to belong. Results are discussed in terms of understanding self-related needs in different contexts of isolation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effect of embracing the Health Belief Model (HBM) in governmental public health messages on social media during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Adoption of the HBM seeks to improve the level of response of Kuwaiti people towards governmental messages regarding social distancing, staying at home, and self-protection. To fulfil the study’s aim, a quantitative research design was adopted in which data were collected from 746 respondents in Kuwait to examine the effect of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, health motivation, and cues to action, based on each individual’s behaviour. Data were analysed through AMOS 22.0 and the findings showed that governmental messages on social media should consider the above-mentioned aspects in order to positively impact the behaviour of Kuwaiti individuals. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: We aim to determine the level of general knowledge and attitudes among the population of Saudi Arabia regarding sexually transmitted illnesses (STI). In addition, we aim to educate participants about the most common STIs, and explore how this influences the participants' attitudes and perceptions. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional web-based survey of the general population of Saudi Arabia. The sample was enrolled randomly by distributing the survey through social media over a two-month period. 420 subjects between the ages of (15-60) participated in the study. Results: Among the 420 total responses, 405 (96%) participants were included based on the absence of missing data in their answers. Most of the participants (77%) were females. More than half of the respondents were single (59%), 24 years old or more (57%), Saudi (52%), and had a bachelor's degree (65%). Forty-eight percent (48%) of the participants were related to the medical field. Only 11% knew someone previously diagnosed with STIs. The mean score of overall knowledge about STI was 8.79 ± 3.17 (median = 9) out of a maximum score of 20. The scores ranged from 2-16. A higher percentage of the participants (48.6%) had a low level of knowledge. Two-hundred eighty-one participants showed interest in viewing the attached educational material and subsequently completed questions on attitude regarding STI education. The mean score for attitude was 5.89 ± 1.52 out of a total of 7 (median = 6). Around 73% of all participants had a positive attitude towards STI education. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that targeting the younger population by incorporating STI-related educational material into school curricula would overcome the stigma associated with these illnesses by raising awareness and improving attitude towards them. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Many eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapists moved their practice online during COVID-19. We conducted surveys and interviews to understand the implementation and acceptability of online EMDR therapy. From 17 June to 2nd August 2021 an online survey was open to EMDR therapists from the EMDR Association UK & Ireland and EMDR International Association email lists, and, through them, their clients. Questions related to determinants of implementation (for therapists) and acceptability (for clients) of online EMDR. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of therapist respondents to provide a deeper understanding of survey responses. Survey responses were received from therapists (n = 562) from five continents, and their clients (n = 148). 88% of clients responded as being extremely or very comfortable receiving EMDR therapy online. At the initial point of ‘social distancing’, 54% of therapists indicated strong or partial reluctance to deliver online EMDR therapy compared to 11% just over one year later. Four fifths of therapists intended to continue offering online therapy after restrictions were lifted. Free-text responses and interview data showed that deprivation and clinical severity could lead to exclusion from online EMDR. Internet connectivity could disrupt sessions, lead to cancellations, or affect the therapy process. Therapists benefited from training in online working. Online EMDR is generally acceptable to therapists and clients, with reservations about digital exclusion, case severity, poor internet connectivity and the need for training. Further research is needed to confirm that online EMDR is clinically non-inferior to in-person working. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic that marked its presence with the need for social distancing, mandatory self-isolations, quarantines and administrative regulatory lockdowns, has, in turn, ushered in a major transition into an all-consuming digital realm, from the physical, material world. The significance of the virtual interactions on digital platforms have increased manifold with tele-mediated interrelationships occurring at work (within the work-from-home mode), education (with stay-at-home schooling), in consumption patterns (online shopping and delivery of products) and political undertakings (such as mailed in polling). As a direct outcome, the idea of space — both physical and social — are undergoing transformations in the way they are being perceived today, more so, within the economic sectors and labour processes. Remote working in India skyrocketed under the influence of COVID-19 and set newer trends in motion making it intriguing to understand how work patterns have changed under this modus operandi. Adopting a primary survey method, conducted online, among IT sector employees of India, results have been generated across various socio-demographic categories to answer questions of efficiency and productivity, availability of infrastructure and work environment, major challenges and benefits encountered and the desired continuity of work-from-home. Through this, the study seeks to highlight whether changing work practices is leading to an overarching sense of digitality over space. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Beliefs based on patriarchy have different manifestations, from gender-insensitive language to discriminatory and prejudiced behavior. While the consequences of patriarchal beliefs are observable and well-studied, more attention is required to unravel the role of societal actors that contribute to both their development and their suppression. The present research applies the novel Socio-cognitive Discourse Studies to investigate how the media acts as a significant mediating public structure that has the potential to enable or disable the reproduction of patriarchy. I investigate the media discourse on sex-selective abortion (SSA)—the practice of the targeted elimination of female fetuses. The study takes the case of Montenegro, listed among the leading countries in the world with a significantly distorted sex ratio at birth. Besides confirming that the majority of the media encourage the status quo through its passive approach to SSA, the socio-cognitive analysis also established the relationship between the media and consumers, revealing how the different discourse strategies the journalists use trigger different cognitive responses among their audience. This study discovered discursive patterns in the public presentation of women while pointing out the crucial role the media plays in disseminating analytical and balanced information on significant and worrisome tendencies, such as SSA. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to determine whether people living in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia would prefer to continue the practice of physical distancing after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic or to return to their previous way of life. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2020 to October 2020 in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia. A pre-tested questionnaire was sent electronically through social media. Data on participants' demographics and their perspectives regarding post-pandemic physical distancing were collected. The calculated sample size was 1,066; however, the total number of responses included in the analysis was 989. Results: The average age of the participants was 31.15±11.93 years. There were 435 men and 554 women in the study. Participants showed significantly high levels of disagreement with statements indicating that they were willing to use public transportation (61%), attend social gatherings (36%), and hug relatives or colleagues (40%) after the pandemic ( p<0.001); however, 43% agreed that they would spend time with family or friends ( p<0.001). The level of education was also found to be significantly related to the responses, and the level of disagreement increased as the level of education increased ( p<0.001). Conclusions: One-third of the study participants planned to continue engaging in physical distancing even after the current pandemic and if the COVID-19 related restriction will remain in place for longer, there is chance to increase in this proportion. However, it cannot be concluded whether or not this behavior will prevail in the long run, after the ease in restrictions. If so, it may greatly affect some businesses and perhaps some social norms and values as well. © 2022 Khan SQ et al.

AB  - The number of multiracial candidates seeking office is growing in an increasingly diverse America. This raises questions about how the media frame candidates with potentially complex racial backgrounds and how voters respond to these frames. We investigate the impact of media frames that emphasize race and gender attributes using survey experiments on Kamala Harris - the first Black woman and first Asian woman vice president. Our findings are mixed. In a survey experiment conducted after her nomination, headlines emphasizing different elements of Harris's race or gender had no impact on public attitudes. In an experiment conducted after Harris was inaugurated, however, headlines that cued her gender only or both her gender and her Black racial background boosted popular support. Taken together, these findings suggest that some types of identity-based cues may matter, but the effects are sensitive to experimental settings and contexts. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is transmitted person-to- person mainly by close contact or droplets from respiratory tract. However, the actual time of viral shedding is still uncertain as well as the different routes of transmission. We aimed to characterize RNA shedding from nasopharyngeal and rectal samples in prolonged cases of mild COVID-19 in young male soldiers. Seventy patients from three different military locations were monitored after recommending to follow more strict isolation measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Then, nasopharyngeal, rectal, and blood samples were taken. SARS-CoV- 2 RNA was detected by RT-PCR and specific antibodies by chemiluminescent immunoassays. The median nucleic acid conversion time (NACT) was 60 days (IQR: 7-85 days). Rectal swabs were taken in 60 % of patients. Seven patients (10 %) were positive in nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs, and five (7.14 %) remained positive in rectal swabs, but negative in nasopharyngeal samples. Four patients (5.71 %) that had been discharged, were positive again after 15 days. No significant difference was found in nucleic acid conversion time between age groups nor clinical classification. Maintaining distancing among different positive patients is essential as a possible re-exposure to the virus could cause a longer nucleic acid conversion time in SARS-COV-2 infections. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the experiences of women who gave birth in the United States during coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). A mixed-methods study was performed using online surveys and interviews. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interview transcripts were analyzed by thematic analysis resulting in major themes. Participants (n = 32) were women who had given birth on or after March 13, 2020. Of the participants, 34% experienced depression, 46% experienced mild to moderate anxiety, and 28% experienced severe anxiety symptoms. Four major themes emerged: expectations versus reality, early versus late COVID-19 experience, mental distress versus mental health, and healthcare policy versus COVID-19 confusion. Experiences varied based upon geographical location, parity, and proximity to support. Short and long-term effects of COVID-19 on participants and their families were recognized. It is important to acknowledge the confusion experienced in many aspects of the birthing experience due to developing or conflicting pandemic or popular media information. Aligning expectations through providing clear, up-to-date information is helpful in decreasing mental distress. Finally, the impact of COVID-19 highlighted the critical need for professional and focused familial support and follow-up for women experiencing pregnancy-related mental health symptoms.

AB  - The aim of this study is to better understand stigma towards individuals with mental illness who commit violent offences, and examine ways to mitigate the negative impact of social media news stories of schizophrenia and violent offending. Psychology undergraduate students (N = 255) were exposed to Instagram images and captions of recent real news stories of violent offending by individuals with schizophrenia. In the experimental condition, contextual clinical explanatory information was integrated. Pre- and post-measures of stigma were completed. There was a significant increase in negative attitudes towards individuals with mental illness who committed violent offences following the no-context condition, which was clearly mitigated in the experimental condition where context was provided. In both conditions, there were significant increases in intended social-distancing behaviours towards and perceptions of dangerousness of individuals with schizophrenia, and negative beliefs about mental illness more generally. There appears to be utility in incorporating knowledge-based clinical information to mitigate some facets of stigma. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP 0.5 and mAP [0.50 : 0.95], respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few-shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Parental attitudes can have a significant impact on the use of medicines in children. This study aimed to investigate parental attitudes towards medicines used in children in Malaysia and the sociodemographic factors associated with it. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study using convenience sampling was conducted among 230 parents with children aged 12 years and below in Malaysia. Data were collected between November 2020 and January 2021 through online platforms. Results: The majority of respondents were mothers (67.8%) and aged between 40-49 years (43.0%). The results showed that antipyretics were the most commonly used medicines followed by cough and cold medicines, antibiotics, and analgesics. The results further revealed that parents have neutral attitudes toward the use of medicines in children (69.90 ± 12.12 from a total score of 105), and mothers and younger parents having a significantly more positive attitude than fathers and older parents, respectively (p < 0.05). Conclusion: This study provided insights into the types of medicines commonly used in children and parental attitudes towards medicines used in children in Malaysia. © 2022, Malaysian Medical Association.

AB  - Background: The adoption of nonpharmaceutical interventions and their surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible transmission routes of COVID-19. A study of the effects of these interventions can help shape public health decisions. The efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions can be affected by public behaviors in events, such as protests. We examined mask use and mask fit in the United States, from social media images, especially during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, representing the first large-scale public gatherings in the pandemic. Objective: This study assessed the use and fit of face masks and social distancing in the United States and events of large physical gatherings through public social media images from 6 cities and BLM protests. Methods: We collected and analyzed 2.04 million public social media images from New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We evaluated correlations between online mask usage trends and COVID-19 cases. We looked for significant changes in mask use patterns and group posting around important policy decisions. For BLM protests, we analyzed 195,452 posts from New York and Minneapolis from May 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020. We looked at differences in adopting the preventive measures in the BLM protests through the mask fit score. Results: The average percentage of group pictures dropped from 8.05% to 4.65% after the lockdown week. New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis observed increases of 5.0%, 7.4%, 7.4%, 6.5%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively, in mask use between February 2020 and May 2020. Boston and Minneapolis observed significant increases of 3.0% and 7.4%, respectively, in mask use after the mask mandates. Differences of 6.2% and 8.3% were found in group pictures between BLM posts and non-BLM posts for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. In contrast, the differences in the percentage of masked faces in group pictures between BLM and non-BLM posts were 29.0% and 20.1% for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. Across protests, 35% of individuals wore a mask with a fit score greater than 80%. Conclusions: The study found a significant drop in group posting when the stay-at-home laws were applied and a significant increase in mask use for 2 of 3 cities where masks were mandated. Although a positive trend toward mask use and social distancing was observed, a high percentage of posts showed disregard for the guidelines. BLM-related posts captured the lack of seriousness to safety measures, with a high percentage of group pictures and low mask fit scores. Thus, the methodology provides a directional indication of how government policies can be indirectly monitored through social media. © Asmit Kumar Singh, Paras Mehan, Divyanshu Sharma, Rohan Pandey, Tavpritesh Sethi, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru.

AB  - The impact that COVID-19 had on individuals globally has been immense. Our study aims to determine if the various COVID-19 related beliefs (information seeking; invulnerability; disruption; health importance and response effectiveness) are predictors of perceived stress and if self-efficacy acts as a mediator in reducing perceived COVID-19 related stress. From a large sample of 23,629, data were assessed using validated multi-item measures for seven COVID-19 related beliefs, self-efficacy and perceived stress. After conducting a series of tests and checks via Confirmatory Factor Analyses, linear modelling and mediation analyses with bootstrapping were applied to test direct and mediation hypotheses. It is found that stress perception is most strongly affected by self-efficacy and perceived disruption. Except for information seeking, which positively affected perceived stress, self-efficacy partially mediates all other COVID-19 related beliefs (perceptions of disruption, health importance and response effectiveness) in conjunction with their direct effects. Only perceived invulnerability elicited opposite effects on stress, increasing stress directly but decreasing stress indirectly by increasing self-efficacy. This finding gives reason to believe that individuals may disclose that they are less vulnerable to COVID-19, fostering their self-efficacy, but still accept that stressing factors such as economic and social consequences apply. Overall, reinforcing self-efficacy was carved out as the most important resilience factor against perceiving high levels of stress. On this basis, implications for research and practice are provided.

AB  - Objectives: In the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, chloroquine and its derivatives such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were widely commented upon both within the scientific community and in the media. This paper explores the different factors that influenced public perceptions in France of the efficacy of HCQ as well as their evolution between April 2020 and June 2021. Methods: This article draws on 5 surveys conducted among representative samples of the French population (projects COCONEL and TRACTRUST; quota method, n = 1006; 1004; 2006; 1014 and 1005). We asked questions on the effectiveness of chloroquine against COVID-19. We also collected sociodemographic variables and attitudes toward politics and science. Results: Between April and June 2021, the proportion of respondents who believed in the efficacy of HCQ decreased rapidly from 35% to 14%. The proportion of respondents who believed that HCQ is ineffective rose gradually from 6% to 21%. After adjusting for the temporal effect, the logistic regression showed a very strong association between political orientation and the belief in the efficacy of HCQ. Respondents who felt closest to the more radical parties (far-right and far-left) were more likely to believe in the efficacy of HCQ than those who felt closest to the political center (O.R. 2.48 [1.95–3.15] and 1.87 [1.44–2.43]). The role of trust in the government and in science and of the degree of political engagement were investigated in the two waves conducted after the scientific consensus was established during the summer of 2020. High levels of trust in the government and in science and of politicization are associated with belief of HCQ proven inefficacy. Across the whole period, a majority of respondents were uncertain. Even in 2021, 41.5% stated that the data were insufficient to decide whether or not HCQ is effective and 25.2% stating that they did not know. Conclusion: Because media coverage of scientific controversies is higher in times of uncertainty than after these controversies have died down, the publicization of therapeutic promises can have lasting consequences on attitudes towards science and medicine. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Objectives: To assess the knowledge and attitudes of physicians of different specialties, including psychiatrists, regarding forensic psychiatry to determine whether further modification or training is needed in the psychiatry residency program. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out using a 3-page, 3-section questionnaire containing 21 questions disseminated randomly online via Google forms using social media platforms. The 482 participants were residents, specialists, and consultants of various specialties. The study was conducted between September 2020 and August 2021 in various tertiary hospitals across Saudi Arabia. Results: A total of 482 physicians were recruited. The most common age group was 25-35 years, comprising mostly Saudis (62.4%). Based on the results, “poor” and “good” knowledge of forensic psychiatry was identified in 89% and 11% of the physicians, while “negative” and “positive” attitudes were identified in 16.4% and 83.6% of the physicians. Conclusion: Although the perspective of physicians regarding forensic psychiatry was found to be positive, their knowledge of the topic seems to be lacking. © 2022 Saudi Arabian Armed Forces Hospital.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual meetings have been widely utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting by Filipino professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 513 Filipino professionals answered an online questionnaire which covered four latent variables: organizational commitment to virtual meetings, attitude toward virtual meetings, perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as collaboration tool, and perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a social tool. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the causal relationships between the latent variables construct. RESULTS: SEM showed that organizational commitment to virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the positive attitude of the employees which subsequently led to the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a collaboration and social tool. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first study that analyzed the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Our SEM construct can be applied and extended further, particularly in analyzing factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - This article explores an emerging strategy by sections of the British radical right towards the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community, who the radical right claim are existentially threatened by the alleged violent homophobia of Islam and their ostensible betrayal by ‘the left’. Consequently, parts of the radical right present themselves as the ‘true’ protectors of LGBTQ+ individuals through what we term alter-progressivism. By analysing recorded speeches, discussions and interviews by and with key British radical right figures, we demonstrate three themes: (1) the broad radical right discourse of a ‘Great Replacement’ specifically tailored towards LGBTQ+ anxieties, (2) a narrative in which the radical right portray themselves as the defenders of (some) minorities and (3) an emerging distinction between the far-right and radical right concerning LGBTQ+ rights. We conclude that these themes represent a significant rhetorical shift and reveal the flexibility of radical right narratives in an attempt to appeal to diverse communities. This represents a serious challenge, which compels social scientists to adapt their understandings of radical right ideologies, objectives and strategies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: Adolescents tend to overestimate the extent of peers’ unhealthy snacking consumption and such misperceptions have been associated with increased personal unhealthy snacking. This study aims to test whether a Social Norms Approach (SNA) intervention which challenges these misperceptions of peers’ unhealthy snacking will have a positive effect on students’ personal unhealthy snacking behaviours, related attitudes, and behavioural intentions. Design: A quasi-experimental study tested the effectiveness of an in-school SNA intervention (n = 163) compared to a control condition (n = 95) among 11–12-year-old students. Method: Both conditions received healthy eating information, while students in the SNA intervention received additional normative feedback (outlining the discrepancies between perceived and actual unhealthy snacking of the majority based on baseline data) delivered through an interactive poster-making session. Students completed self-reported measures of personal unhealthy snacking, related-attitudes, behavioural intentions, and normative perceptions (descriptive and injunctive) at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results: Students who received SNA feedback were significantly less likely to overestimate peers’ unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention (F(1,232) = 16.405, p <.001), and at 3-month follow-up consumed fewer unhealthy snacks (F(1,232) = 6.133, p =.014) and had less positive attitudes towards unhealthy snacking (F(1,198) = 8.779, p =.003). The changes in personal snacking attitudes at 3-month follow-up were mediated by changes in normative misperceptions about peers’ unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention, which indicated that the reductions in normative misperceptions following SNA messages mediated the effect of the intervention. Conclusion: The results indicate that in-school SNA interventions which challenge normative misperceptions constitute a promising strategy for reducing unhealthy snacking in young adolescents. © 2022 The British Psychological Society

AB  - Introduction The benefits of antibiotics are under threat by self-medication, which culminated in economic burdening of developing countries, treatment failures, the emergence of antibioticresistant strains of bacteria and an increased probability of exposure and infection of the general population by antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of medical students in Sudan towards the use of antibiotics, the prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics among medical students in Sudan and to identify risk factors which promote self-medication with antibiotics. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional, descriptive and institution-based study, between November 2020 and May 2021. 1, 110 medical students were selected by multistage cluster sampling. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of self-medication with antibiotics among the study participants. Results The median knowledge score was 7 out of a maximum of 10 (IQR: 5-8). A moderately positive attitude was observed among the participants (Median: 7/10; IQR: 6-8). Knowledge and attitude scores were significantly associated with academic year and monthly allowance (p < 0.05). 675 (60.8%) self-medicated with antibiotics within the previous 12 months, mostly from community pharmacies (321/675; 47.5%). Antibiotics were most commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections (38.1%) and cough (30.4%). Chi-square analysis demonstrated that self-medication with antibiotics was significantly associated with gender, year of study and monthly income. Conclusions Undergraduate medical students had moderate knowledge and attitude towards antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, and an alarmingly high prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics. This highlights the urgent need for tighter legislation regarding the sales of antibiotics in community pharmacies by the state and federal health ministries. © 2022 Elmahi et al.

AB  - As a conduit of knowledge for the general public, news media inform the development and maintenance of attitudes and beliefs about a range of topics, including mental health and related behaviors. News mediaportrayals of such topics can, therefore, contribute to stigma—the culmination of harmful stereotypes,prejudice, and discrimination. A topic of increasing media and research interest is self-harm, a behavior thatis still poorly understood and highly stigmatized. Despite the potential for news media to be a source of selfharmstigma, few investigations of such portrayals have been conducted. To understand how news mediaportrays self-harm, a qualitative media framing analysis was conducted on 545 news articles published inAustralia during 2019. Six frames were identified: Inevitably Suicidal, A Tragic Outcome, Mentally Unwell,An Epidemic, Threatening and Dangerous, and A Manipulative Tactic, each drawing on a broader narrativeof pathology, instability, and damage. Use of problematic language and a lack of definitional clarityreinforced these frames. While the analyzed articles are limited to an Australian context, findingsdemonstrate continued misrepresentations of self-harm, which arguably contribute to ongoing self-harmstigma.

AB  - Despite increasing efforts to implement legislative gender quotas, many countries still encounter substantial popular opposition to this policy. Previous work cannot explain why opposition to legislative gender quotas persists, particularly among young men, a group believed to be open to diversity. We develop and test a theoretical framework linking group threat to men's attitudes toward legislative gender quotas. While the salience of perceived group threat could trigger men's opposition to legislative gender quotas, we expect that this effect will be more profound among young men due to the heightened degree of economic insecurity experienced by younger generations. Using original survey experiments in South Korea, this study demonstrates the strong influence of group threat in the formation of negative attitudes toward legislative gender quotas among young men. These effects, however, are not mediated by traditional gender norms. Our findings have significant implications for the study of gender and politics and democratic representation. © 2022 Washington University in St. Louis

AB  - The current investigation examined how experiencing a shared reality during the social reconstruction of the past might relate to communicators’ perceived authenticity and self-esteem. In two experiments, participants were randomly assigned to describe an autobiographical memory to an audience who had either a positive or negative attitude toward the memory topic. Participants then reported perceptions of shared reality, authenticity, and self-esteem. Across both experiments, experiencing a shared reality with an audience who held a positive attitude was associated with greater self-perceived authenticity and self-esteem, whereas experiencing a shared reality with an audience who held a negative attitude was associated with lower ratings of authenticity and lower self-esteem. The effect of shared reality on self-esteem was mediated by perceptions of authenticity. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction As of February 2021 COVID-19 report in 57 African countries, there were 3,761,512 confirmed cases and 98,088 deaths. Ethiopia reported the highest number of cases in East Africa with a total of 147,092 cases and 2,194 deaths. Over 1.5 billion students from 195 countries across the world separated from school as a consequence of the closure of schools related to the pandemic. This study aimed to determine the level of knowledge, attitude, prevention practices, and determinant factors regarding COVID-19 among preparatory school students in southwest Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study design was used for 422 samples. Each respondent was selected using simple random sampling. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. The collected data were entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for social science software version 25.0. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to identify factors that were significantly associated with the practice of COVID-19 prevention. Results The response rate in this study was 96.2%. A higher proportion of the respondents were female (53.9%), Bench (43.6%), and protestant (47.3%). The level of good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice were 81.8%, 70.9%, and 47.0% respectively. Using social media [AOR: 1.801, 95% CI: 1.005, 3.226], watching television [AOR: 1.884 95% CI: 1.093, 3.247], being knowledgeable [AOR: 5.173 95% CI: 2.276, 11.755], and having a positive attitude [AOR: 4.300 95% CI: 2.351, 7.868] were positively associated with COVID-19 prevention practice. Conclusion Despite the high level of knowledge and a moderate level of positive attitude, the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures was low. Using social media, watching television, being knowledgeable, and having positive attitudes towards COVID-19 increases the tendency to practice COVID-19 prevention measures.

AB  - Drawing from the terror management theory (TMT) and evolutionary perspectives of Life-History Strategy, a between-subject online experiment examined the interaction effects of pre-existing death anxiety, fear-inducing media content (coronavirus threat vs. gun violence threat vs. low threat mental disorder), and intrasexual competition for mates on online dating intentions and social distancing intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate the interaction effects of participants’ pre-experimental death anxiety and different types of fear-inducing media content on perceived fear and intention to use online dating websites/apps as well as the interaction effects of pre-experimental intrasexual competitiveness and fear-inducing media content on social distancing intention in the context of online dating. Theoretical contributions to the terror management literature and practical implications for the online dating industry are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The recent rise of political extremity and radicalization has presented unique challenges to contemporary politics, governance, and social cohesion in many societies in the world. In this study, we propose an imagined audience approach to understand how social media’s expanded expression capabilities are related to users’ political extremity and reduced network interaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one’s political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample. We conclude by discussing the significance of our imagined audience approach and its relevance to today’s technology-mediated self-presentation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the process of business model innovation, the cognitive psychology of innovators is directly related to their innovative intentions and behaviors. Social exchange theory exhibits that there are reciprocal relationships, positive or negative, between innovators and organizations. While a positive reciprocity refers to a match between organizational rewards and individual contributions, which promotes innovators to form a psychological contract and actively engage in business model innovation activities, a negative reciprocity arises when organizations fail to fulfill their commitment, which leads to psychological contract violation of innovators and results in negative attitudes and behaviors that may hinder the process of business model innovation. Although not much research has been done by now, it is interesting to explore the effects of innovators' psychological contract violation on business model innovation. On the other hand, while most effort has been on the positive factors in the research on business model innovation, it is necessary to study not only positive, but also negative influencing factors to effectively analyze and guide the influencing factors of business model innovation. Relevant research in psychology states that negative emotions could have a greater impact on innovators than positive emotions. Therefore, it is important to explore the effects of psychological contract violation on business model innovation. In this work we shall explore, from the perspective of negative cognition, the impact of psychological contract violation (including transaction contract violation, development contract violation, and relationship contract violation) on business model innovation, and introduces self-actualization destruction as a mediator variable and workplace ostracism as a moderator variable. First of all, a structural equation model is used to verify the direct effect of psychological contract violation on business model innovation and the mediating role of self-actualization destruction. Then, Bootstrap method is employed to examine the moderating role of the workplace ostracism in the relationship between self-actualization destruction and business model innovation, as well as the moderating role in the mediating relationship among psychological contract violation, self-actualization destruction, and business model innovation. The results are as follows. First, the direct impact of psychological contract violation on business model innovation is not significant. Second, the self-actualization destruction plays a complete mediating role in the relationship between psychological contract violation and business model innovation. Third, workplace ostracism strengthens the negative relationship between the self-actualization destruction and business model innovation. In other words, when innovators perceive a stronger atmosphere of workplace ostracism, their self-actualization destruction has a stronger negative impact on business model innovation. Moreover, workplace ostracism plays a moderating role in the mediation path of “ psychological contract violation, self-actualization destruction and business model innovation. ” That is, the stronger the atmosphere of workplace ostracism perceived by the innovator, the stronger the mediating role of self-actualization destruction in the relationship between psychological contract violation and business model innovation. The findings of this study contribute to the theory in this direction in various aspects. Firstly, starting from the negative influencing factors of business model innovation, we construct a moderated mediation model based on the negative cognition of individual innovators. By analyzing the acting path of psychological contract violation on business model innovation and then testing the validity of the model through empirical research, this work fills the current research gap of the negative influencing factors of business model innovation. Secondly, we propose the self-actualization destruction as a mediating variable and explore its mediating role in the relationship between psychological contract violation and business model innovation, which enriches the mechanism of this role and expands the research on the impact of psychological contract violation. Thirdly, we introduce the workplace ostracism as a moderating variable to analyze the impact of organizational context factors on innovators' psychology and innovative behavior, which deepens the understanding of the relationship between psychological contract violation and business model innovation. In addition, by exploring the mechanism of psychological contract violation on business model innovation, this work exposes the negative side of the reciprocity principle and reveals the role of the negative reciprocity principle in business model innovation management. © 2022.

AB  - In comforting or distressing circumstances, individuals tend to have various perceptions of themselves. It seems that religious comfort and religious distress correlate differently with people’s self-esteem. Since the relationship between religiosity and self-esteem is not only direct but can be mediated by other factors that are recognized as buffers against adverse situations, our main goal was to verify whether dispositional gratitude may have an indirect effect on the association between both variables. The research involved data from 254 participants aged 18 to 25 (M = 21.24; SD = 2.09) and included 192 women (76%) and 62 men (24%). To measure the title variables, we used: the Religious Comfort and Strain Scale (RCSS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6). The results showed that people who consider religion as a source of comfort express positive attitudes toward the self and recognize others’ kindness, as well. In contrast, people who consider religiosity as a cause of fear, stress, and internal strain tend to display a lower subjective sense of personal worth and lower appreciation of the positivity around them. Moreover, gratitude had a mediatory effect on the relationships between religious comfort/negative emotions toward God and self-esteem. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between knowledge sharing and sustainable happiness, and tested the multiple mediating effects of self-efficacy and helping behavior in this relationship. A survey was conducted in Taiwan to test the attitudes of preschool teachers toward sustainable happiness and several related factors. The questionnaire consisted of four latent factors: knowledge sharing, sustainable happiness, self-efficacy, and helping behavior. Partial least squares were used to analyze the sample data and examine both the reliability and validity of the latent factors of the questionnaire in the measurement model. Statistical analysis indicated that the measurement model was reliable, and multiple mediation analysis was performed for hypothesized relationships. The results of the multiple mediating analysis indicated that self-efficacy and helping behavior positively mediate the association between knowledge sharing and sustainable happiness. The sustainable happiness of preschool teachers is influenced by their perceptions of knowledge sharing about their career happiness and workplace well-being to achieve sustainable development goals. Their positive attitudes toward self-efficacy and helping behavior enhance their individual happiness and wellbeing and achieve a sustainable workplace, which contributes to global sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Based on an integrated model of doctor–patient psychological mechanisms, the formation mechanism of doctor-–patient trust was systematically demonstrated from the healthcare professional (HCP)’s perspective integrating intergroup relations (expectations), interpersonal relations (communication), and psychosocial (stereotypes). The results of a survey of 3000 doctors and nurses from 14 provinces in eastern, central, and western China support the rationality of an integrated model of doctor–patient psychological mechanisms. The establishment of doctor–patient trust is influenced by the direct role of primary intergroup factors, the indirect role of immediate interpersonal interactions, and the moderating role of social psychology. Specifically, (1) doctor–patient trust is directly predicted by HCP’s expectation and indirectly influenced by communication; (2) stereotypes regulate the relationship between HCP’s expectation, communication, and doctor–patient trust: the activation of positive stereotypes enhances the positive relationship among the three; Negative stereotypes only positively contribute to mediated pathway-communication behaviors and have a weaker facilitation effect compared to positive stereotypes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if social undermining as perceived by frontline employees significantly affects their emotional exhaustion and procrastination behavior and to clarify the moderating role of positive psychological capital. A total of 310 deluxe hotel employees in South Korea participated in this study by completing a self-administered questionnaire. The study results showed that social undermining perceived by deluxe hotel employees positively influenced their emotional exhaustion. In addition, when emotional exhaustion became severe, employees’ procrastination behavior, which harmed their organizations, increased. Additionally, the findings suggest a mediating effect, thereby indicating that employees’ procrastination behaviors may increase when they experience emotional exhaustion resulting from social undermining. When employees perform their jobs with a positive attitude in a work situation, the negative influence of social undermining and emotional exhaustion may be partially offset. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Narratives about Africa as dark, depraved, and diseased justified the exploitation of African land and people. Today, these narratives may still have a hold on people’s fears about disease. We test this in three (pre-COVID-19) experiments (N = 1,803). Across studies, we find that participants report greater worry about a pandemic originating in Africa (vs. elsewhere). In turn, they report greater support for travel bans and for loosening abortion restrictions. We then document these narratives in an archival study of newspaper articles of the 2015–2016 Zika pandemic (N = 1,475). We find that articles were more negative—for example, they included more death-related words—if they mentioned Africa. Finally, we replicate the experimental results within the COVID-19 context, using a representative sample (N = 1,200). Taken together, the studies make clear that reactions to pandemics are biased, and in a way consistent with historical narratives about race and Africa. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Although the effectiveness of intergroup contact as a mechanism for reducing prejudice is well-established, limited research has simultaneously examined this effect among groups that are in different contact relationships. Using data based on a between-group cross-sectional design from 335 Turkish undergraduate students, this study compared the direct and the indirect association of intergroup contact with prejudice toward Kurds and Syrians in Turkey through intergroup threat. The results showed that intergroup contact predicted less prejudice toward Kurds but not toward Syrians, and intergroup threat mediated the role of intergroup contact in prejudice toward Kurds but not toward Syrians. The findings were discussed based on theories of intergroup contact and intergroup threat, with a reflection on the limitations, extensions, and implications of the study. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Tremendous efforts will be required in the coming decades to limit the harmful effects of climate change. This includes travel behavior, which not only has a significant impact on climate but also affects the perceived justice and trust necessary to manage the transition to net zero successfully. Technologies such as social media can promote behavioral change; unfortunately, also for the negative. Drawing on social comparison theory, social identity theory, and the theory of planned behavior, this study uses a PLS-SEM model to investigate if and under which circumstances exposure to travel-related content posted by professional influencers affects their followers’ travel intentions. It extends previous studies by explicitly focusing on influencers that use Instagram to make a living and considers the effect of pro-environmental attitudes. On the one hand, it shows that influencers are not only responsible for their travel behavior. Their content stimulates their audiences’ wanderlust through benign envy. On the other hand, the study suggests that reinforcing pro-environmental attitudes can help mitigate the negative climate effects of imitating influencer travel behavior. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and severity, it is essential to make it a habit to follow various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Individuals are widely educated about the safety measures against the disease through various modes such as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media, and so on. The younger generations today spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few applications or games aimed to help in practicing safety measures against a pandemic, which is much lesser in the case of Covid-19. Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android-based mobile game, along with a desktop (browser) version and has been evaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using the questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model. The survey results are promising, with all the survey questions having a mean value greater than 3.5. The game’s quality factor was 69.3, indicating that the game could be classified as excellent quality, according to the MEEGA+ model. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction: People with cancer are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19 infection. We investigated COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients with solid organ and blood cancers and explored factors related to hesitancy. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey of adults with a history of cancer at three health services across metropolitan and regional Victoria. Vaccine hesitancy was measured by the validated Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale. Results: There were 1073 respondents: 56% female; median age 62 years (range 23 - 91). Commonest tumor types included breast 29%, gastrointestinal 19%, hematological 15%, genitourinary 15%, and lung 8%. Thirty-six percent had metastatic disease, and 54% were receiving active anticancer treatment. Eighty-four percent of respondents indicated positive intent toward COVID-19 vaccination, 10% were undecided, and 6% indicated negative attitudes. At least one vaccine dose had been received by 65% of respondents, leaving 35% unvaccinated. Fifty-eight percent of unvaccinated patients answered that they would “definitely” or “probably” take a vaccine. Higher vaccine uptake was significantly associated with older age, male gender, English as first language, longer time since cancer diagnosis, and not being on current anticancer treatment. Concerns regarding vaccine side effects, particularly thrombosis, and the desire for clear medical advice were prominent among unvaccinated respondents. Conclusion: Despite being eligible for COVID-19 vaccination since March 2021, a substantial minority of patients with cancer remained unvaccinated as of August 2021. Targeted communication and educational resources addressing vaccine safety in the context of cancer are key to promoting vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine intention among Bangladeshi adults. Methods Secondary data from the COVID-19 Beliefs, Behaviors & Norms Survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Facebook were analyzed. Data were collected from 2,669 adult Facebook users in Bangladesh and was collected between February 15 and February 28, 2021. Binomial logistic regression examined the relationship between COVID-19 vaccination intent and demographic variables, risk perception, preventive behaviors, COVID-19 knowledge, and likelihood of future actions. Results Seventy-nine percent of respondents reported intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available. Intent to get vaccinated was highest among females, adults aged 71- 80, individuals with college or graduate-level degrees, city dwellers, and individuals who perceived that they were in excellent health. Results of the binomial logistic regression indicated that predictors of vaccination intent include age (OR = 1.39), high risk perception of COVID-19 (OR = 1.47), and intent to practice social distancing (OR = 1.22). Discussion Findings suggest that age, perceived COVID-19 risk, and non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions may predict COVID-19 vaccination intent among Bangladeshi adults. Findings can be used to create targeted messaging to increase demand for and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in Bangladesh. © 2022 Lee et al.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of knowledge that women have about menopause and to analyse whether sociodemographic aspects can influence it. For this, a multi-centre observational study was conducted in Spain using a survey including 2500 women between 35 and 75 years. Participants were administered a 10-question questionnaire with a maximum score of 45 points. The responses of 2355 women were analysed. The median age was 52 years (IQR 45–59) and the median of knowledge score was 22 points (IQR 16–27). Age (p <.001), menopausal status (p =.030), early menopause (p =.001), educational level (p <.001), type of healthcare (p <.001) and sources of information on menopause (p <.001) were factors related to the score on the questionnaire. We conclude that Spanish women have limited knowledge about menopause and it is urgent to implement training programs that can improve it. IMPACT STATEMENT: What is already known on this subject? The knowledge and attitudes about menopause among women can vary across countries and also according to sociocultural context. It also seems that negative attitudes towards menopause and poor knowledge of the physiology and the most frequent symptoms have an increasing effect on the severity of the specific symptoms of menopause that cause further discomfort. What do the results of this study add? There are very few available reports or research on the issue of postmenopausal health in Spain. We believe that it is appropriate to explore the level of knowledge of women in our country. We have verified that the level of knowledge of Spanish women is low and that some sociodemographic aspects can influence it What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Taking into account our results, it is a priority to implement health training programs to improve knowledge about menopause in Spanish women and overcome false myths and wrong beliefs. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: We report on the safety and immunogenicity of V591, a measles vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. Methods: In this multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 1/2 trial, healthy adults with no history of COVID-19 disease were assigned to intramuscular injection of V591 or placebo (4:1 ratio). In part 1, younger adults (18-55 years) received V591 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)-levels of 1×105 or 1×106 or placebo, 56 days apart. In part 2, younger and older (&gt;55 years) adults received a single dose of one of four (104/105/106/107) or one of two (105/106) V591 TCID50 levels, respectively, or placebo. Primary outcome: safety/tolerability. Secondary outcome: humoral immunogenicity. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04498247. Findings: From August–December 2020, 444 participants were screened and 263 randomised (210 V591; 53 placebo); 262 received at least one and 10 received two doses of V591 or placebo. Adverse events were experienced by 140/209 (67.0%) V591 dose-group participants and 37/53 (69.8%) placebo-group participants following injection 1; most frequent were fatigue (57 [27.3%] vs 20 [37.7%]), headache (57 [27.3%] vs 19 [35.8%]), myalgia (35 [16.7%] vs 10 [18.9%]), and injection-site pain (35 [16.7%] vs 4 [7.5%]). No deaths nor vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. At Day 29, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike serum neutralising antibody and IgG-responses were identified in placebo or the three lower V591 dose-groups; responses were detected with V591 1×107 TCID50, although titres were lower than convalescent serum. Interpretation: V591 was generally well tolerated, but immunogenicity was insufficient to warrant continued development.

AB  - During the first four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, African countries recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be one of the biggest disasters the continent has faced in recent times. The effects of the virus were being felt at unprecedented levels and like all nations in the world, countries in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were grappling with travel bans and social distancing measures. Through a critical discourse analysis lens, this article examines the tensions and contradictions evident in the excerpts of online news articles and newspaper reports published from March 2020 to September 2020 in the SACU region, focusing on the instructive decision-makers charged with the pandemic-driven technology’s adoption and the impact of these decisions on tertiary students in the region. Central to our argument is that responsiveness should not come at the cost of accessibility as this will have a negative impact on remote teaching and online learning, and further entrench the vicious cycle of epistemic injustice and inequity. The discourse in the media reveals that most universities are heavily reliant on learning management systems in an attempt to save the academic year, while there is evidence of unevenness in the distribution of digital infrastructure which has an impact on economically marginalized students. Beyond digital equity issues, there was a need for differentiated professional development activities for lecturers on technology-enabled pedagogies and e-assessments. Furthermore, there is a need for an in-depth exploratory large-scale research to document user-stories on the emergence of remote teaching in the SACU region in order to develop a service-oriented architecture for digital education in higher education institutions (HEIs). © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Religion can determine how people perceive socio-political reality, especially in a cultural context in which religious affiliation is an important part of national identity. This has a special significance in the Polish cultural context, in which Catholicism is considered the national religion, and its institutional dimension plays an important role in the Polish socio-political domain. The purpose of this study is to analyse how religion affects the socio-political attitudes of Poles abroad. This analysis focuses directly on evaluating the influence of the spiritual leaders of Polish community organisations in the UK on the knowledge and opinions of Brexit among Polish post-accession emigrants to the UK. The study was conducted on a sample of 620 Poles living in the UK (62.6% male) using a group-administered questionnaire. The study found that the Polish Catholic clergy did not play an important role in opinion-forming, i.e., in shaping what Polish emigrants to the UK know and think about Brexit. What proved to be the most powerful factor in terms of opinion-making was the British mass media. The influence of the Catholic clergy on the knowledge of—and opinions on—Brexit among Polish emigrants was only evident among elderly people who did not know English very well, and who regularly participated in religious activities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the key factors influencing the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and develop a model based on the theory of reasoned action, belief in conspiracy theory, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use. The authors created and distributed a self-administered online questionnaire using Google Forms. Data were collected from 351 respondents ranging in age from 19 to 30 years, studying at the graduate and postgraduate levels at various public universities in Bangladesh. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that belief in conspiracy theory undermines COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, thereby negatively impacting the individual attitudes, subjective norms, and acceptance. Individual awareness, on the other hand, has a strong positive influence on the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Furthermore, the perceived usefulness of vaccination and the perceived ease of obtaining the vaccine positively impact attitude and the acceptance of immunization. Individuals’ positive attitudes toward immunization and constructive subjective norms have a positive impact on vaccine acceptance. This study contributes to the literature by combining the theory of reasoned action with conspiracy theory, awareness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use to understand vaccine acceptance behavior. Authorities should focus on campaigns that could reduce misinformation and conspiracy surrounding COVID-19 vaccination. The perceived usefulness of vaccination to prevent pandemics and continue normal education will lead to vaccination success. Furthermore, the ease with which people can obtain the vaccine and that it is free of cost will encourage students to get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families, and society. © 2022 Public Library of Science.

AB  - This paper examines a new type of entrepreneurship conducted via social networking sites named as social media entrepreneurship. In Tunisia, the number of women entrepreneurs operating on social media platforms such as Facebook is noteworthy. Thus, in this study it is aimed to determine the factors that prompted women to develop businesses on Facebook, and how this social network is a venue for female entrepreneurship. Particular attention is paid to identify individual-related (push/pull entrepreneurial motivation), technology-related and institutional factors that bear on the use of social media. To this end, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 24 female entrepreneurs. The research findings provide relevant information and support the idea that social media has opened up new horizons and entrepreneurial opportunities for women to pursue their entrepreneurial intention. Pull motivations are really behind the decision to start up social commerce. Facebook advantageous features have empowered women to create customer networks, used nature marketing tool at no cost and acquire positive attitude towards entrepreneurship. Finally, although the informal nature of business on Facebook is attractive, formalization remains a challenge for the majority of women. It seems that ambition to grow their businesses brings them to formal economy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions in our contact with others and the introduction of social distancing barriers. These rules can enhance the psychological mechanisms resulting from fear of contamination and may lead to exacerbating prejudiced attitudes towards certain social groups seen as possible carriers of infection. Fear of infection and ideas about cleanliness and dirtiness have indeed historically and culturally influenced the way we interact with other people, both on an inter-personal and inter-group level. The aim of the present research is to analyse whether the concern about COVID-19 is linked to prejudices towards other social groups and whether this relationship is mediated by individual representations of cleanliness. Results on 251 Italian citizens showed that concerns about COVID-19 are positively related to prejudicial attitudes towards immigrants and that such a relation is indeed mediated by so-called cultural representations of cleanliness. Specifically, the so-called cultural representations of hygiene—by which people and groups are categorized as being more or less civilized on the basis of their cleaning practices—was a significant mediator.

AB  - Background: Reported experiences of racism in Aotearoa New Zealand are consistently associated with negative measures of health, self-rated health, life satisfaction, and reduced access to high-quality healthcare with subsequent poor health outcomes. In this paper, we report on perceptions and experiences of prejudice and racism by Indigenous Māori with kidney disease and their family members and donors who took part in a wider study about experiences of kidney transplantation. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 Māori between September and December 2020. Participants included those with kidney disease who had considered, were being worked up for, or who had already received a kidney transplant as well as family members and potential or previous donors. We examined the data for experiences of racism using a theoretical framework for racism on three levels: institutionalised racism, personally mediated racism, and internalised racism. Results: We identified subthemes at each level of racism: institutional (excluded and devalued by health system; disease stigmatization; discriminatory body weight criteria, lack of power), personally mediated (experiencing racial profiling; explicit racism), and internalized racism (shame and unworthiness to receive a transplant). Conclusions: The wide-reaching experiences and perceptions of racism described by participants with kidney disease and their families in this research point to an unfair health system and suggest that racism may be contributing to kidney transplantation inequity in Aotearoa New Zealand. Addressing racism at all levels is imperative if we are to address inequitable outcomes for Māori requiring kidney transplantation. © 2021, W. Montague Cobb-NMA Health Institute.

AB  - (1) Background: It is important to improve vaccination strategies and immunization programs to achieve herd immunity to infectious diseases. (2) Methods: To assess the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, we conducted face-to-face surveys and online surveys in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Qinghai provinces. A fixed-effect model and a random effects model were used to analyze factors associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. (3) Findings: We initially recruited 3173 participants, 3172 participants completed the full questionnaire (the response rate was nearly 100%), of which 2169 were valid questionnaires, with an effective rate of 87.3%. The results indicated that 82.6% of participants were willing to receive vaccination when it was available in the community, and 57.2% of deliverymen, 43.3% of medical workers, 78.2% of parents of primary and secondary school children, and 72.2% of parents of preschool children were willing to receive vaccination. The models showed that participants who were male (female vs. male: OR = 1.49, 95% CI (1.12, 1.98)), 60 to 69 years-old (60–69 vs. <30: OR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.29, 0.92)), had less education (medium vs. low: OR = 1.50, 95% CI (1.05, 2.23)), had good health status (good vs. low: OR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.15, 0.88)), and had positive attitudes and trust (OR = 0.14, 95% CI (0.10, 0.20)) in vaccines approved by the National Health Commission were more likely to accept vaccination. Participants also had an increased vaccination acceptance if it was recommended by government sources, doctors, relatives, or friends. Most participants learned about COVID-19 vaccination from television, radio, and newspapers, followed by community or hospital campaigns and the internet. (4) Conclusions: Government sources and doctors could increase the acceptance of vaccination by promoting the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination by the use of mass media and emphasizing the necessity of vaccination for everyone. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This analysis tests two distinct predictions regarding local newspapers’ coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. A public service view of local newspapers predicts that a robust local newspaper sector would mitigate the politicized national partisan rhetoric surrounding COVID-19; reducing the disparity in social-distancing behaviors between predominantly Republican and predominantly Democratic counties by increasing compliance in Republican counties. The alternative hypothesis, informed by a demand-side view of the market pressures local newspapers face, predicts that increased competition between local newspapers will increase the degree to which local newspapers amplify the rhetoric of national officials in line with the partisan composition of their community, further polarizing adherence to social-distancing behaviors across predominantly Republican versus predominantly Democratic counties. The results of this analysis offer strong support for the second hypothesis; but, an additional analysis of vaccination rates offers a more nuanced perspective than a simple public service versus demand-side dichotomy would imply. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective:The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the perceptions and experiences of nurses caring for patients and families under the COVID-19 pandemic's socially restrictive practices and policies.Background:The COVID-19 global pandemic has affected the delivery of health care to patients and their families, with many aspects altered because of the need for social distancing, social isolation, and visitation restriction policies. These policies have created communication challenges for interdisciplinary health care teams, patients, and families. As frontline caregivers, nurses have felt strongly the impact of these challenges.Methods:A qualitative descriptive study was conducted among 17 RNs who were caring for patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and were recruited via social media posts on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Watson's theory of human caring served as the conceptual framework for the study.Results:Several themes emerged regarding nurses' experiences of communication with patients and families. These include communication challenges and barriers, prioritization, integration of group communication, nurse self-reflection, and acceptance of gratitude.Conclusions:The study findings underscore the importance of nurses' communication with patients and families under the pandemic's restricted conditions. They demonstrate the value of nurses' ability to innovate in fostering all parties' participation in the plan of care, and highlight the comfort nurses provide to patients who are isolated from loved ones. Strategies that fostered communication were identified, as were areas for further research. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human relationships and bonding reconfigure and reinvent themselves over time. For several decades, it has been interesting to note that both the digital dimension and the development of artificial intelligence have played a great evolutionary role in our relational society. There is an accessibility and intensification of social exchanges between internet users (published writings, photos, conversations, conferences…). Although we access this interplanetary sharing of connection, despite everything the distancing and physical emotional social deprivation between several individuals belonging to a different household can bring significantly high suffering. Moreover, with the Covid-19 crisis, there has also been that fragility of our own personal doubt that will settle psychically in us: the uncertainty will be more intimate, more present and more distressing. If there is exposure to a potentially threatening stimulus as is the case with COVID-19, the exploration of positive or negative resources of survival and that of creativity (psychological capital) will emerge during this first increasedmajor confinement in order to bring non-negligible and bearable psychic responses to possible traumas and episodes of acute stress. However, the goal of this article is to propose a possible understanding of a resilience, thought and mobilized from a systemic approach: The relationship between the individual and his different systems of social, relational and existential belonging. © 2021 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - Social science interest in professionals and managers as a left- and liberal-trending stratum has increased in recent years. Using General Social Survey data over a 44-year period, the authors examine 15 attitudes spanning social, economic, and political identity liberalism. On nearly all attitudes, professionals and managers have trended in a liberal direction, have liberalized more quickly than blue-collar workers, and are either as or more liberal than blue-collar workers. The authors find that the higher levels of education among professionals and managers, their tendency to adopt nonauthoritarian outlooks, and their lower propensity to identify with fundamentalist religion mediate their more liberal trends vis-à-vis blue-collar workers. Conversely, their higher relative incomes suppress the extent of their economic and criminal justice liberalism. The authors’ theorization links changes in the macro-economy to growing gaps in the composition of the two strata and the activities of politicians and parties to consolidate emerging political differences. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: To provide an updated evaluation of otolaryngology residency program websites during a socially distanced application cycle. Criteria were selected to evaluate for level of comprehensiveness, new content accommodating a virtual interview cycle, and stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. Study design: Review of otolaryngology residency program websites. Setting: Online websites between December 2020 and January 2021. Methods: Otolaryngology residency program websites were evaluated for selected criteria. Programs were categorized by geographic location, size, and Doximity rankings. Differences between groups were analyzed using Student’s t-test and analysis of variance with a significance level of P <.05. Results: 118 otolaryngology residency program websites contained a mean (SD) of 16.3 (4.7) of 31 criteria (52.6%). Fewer than one third included virtual/video tours of facilities or the surrounding area. Only 33% had a stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. There was no difference in number of criteria included when categorized by geographic location (P =.22). Larger programs (17.9 vs 14.5, P <.001) and programs ranked in the top 50 by Doximity (17.7 vs 15.2, P =.003) included a significantly greater number of criteria. Conclusion: While the comprehensiveness of otolaryngology residency program websites has improved, considerable room for improvement remains. Programs should strive to maintain updated websites that highlight training opportunities, program culture, and commitment to diversity and inclusion. Programs also should consider prioritizing the development of new online resources that may be especially useful to applicants during a virtual interview cycle. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - While at first the fear of COVID-19 disease spread was limited by the fact that the pandemic appeared to be confined to China, the growing emergency in Italy and the rapid escalation in positive cases and deaths have made the threat of this disease a national as well as global phenomenon. In the present research, a questionnaire was collected both before (n = 396) and during (n = 250) the outbreak of the pandemic in Italy. The aim of the research was to analyze the possible mediation of binding moral foundations on the relationship between concerns over COVID-19 and prejudice vis-à-vis immigrants. As hypothesized, the results show that concerns over COVID-19 increased greatly after the start of the Italian pandemic. Moreover, both before and during the pandemic, the relationship between concerns over COVID-19 and prejudice toward immigrants is mediated by binding moral foundations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The issues of whether mobile-assisted English as a foreign language (EFL) reading is effective have become increasingly important for EFL teachers and policy-makers. However, empirical studies investigating EFL students’ reading comprehension performance on mobile phones and students’ perceptions of these reading formats are lacking. The present research employed questionnaire surveys and semistructured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading in terms of participants’ reading comprehension accuracy, reading speed, and reading strategy used (i.e. general, problem-solving or support strategies) and explore EFL learners’ perceptions of mobile-assisted EFL reading. A sample of 81 first-year college students participated in a quasiexperiment, 6 participants participated in a semistructured interview, and a sample of an additional 10 students participated in a pilot study. The analyses, including qualitative descriptions, mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired-sample t-tests, and independent-sample t-tests, indicated that participants achieved superior reading comprehension accuracy when reading from printed paper compared to reading from mobile phones. Superior reading speed from paper was observed only when participants were instructed to read and complete the comprehension test the first time, while no difference in speed between the two reading media was observed the second time. Additionally, participants’ use of reading strategies during mobile-assisted EFL reading was not as effective as that during paper reading. Regarding participants’ preferences, most participants (79%) preferred reading from paper over mobile phones because hard copies provided a better reading experience and promoted active reading engagement. However, participants held positive attitudes toward mobile-assisted EFL learning and wanted to continue to read from mobile phones to assist their foreign language learning due to their convenient built-in functions and portability. The implications for the use of mobile devices to assist language pedagogical practice are discussed. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to review themes and methodological strategies of the Brazilian scientific literature regarding families headed by gay and lesbian parents. Methods: We performed the searches in November 2019 and January 2020 in the Web of Science, EBSCOHost, PUBMED/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases, from 2009 to 2019, in Portuguese and English languages, and yielded 20 eligible articles. We followed PRISMA protocol guidelines and we carried out a thematic analysis in NVivo. Results: Four broad themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the data available in the articles retrieved: (a) Family conceptions: the historical importance of the biological bond and the idea of affection as a means by which these parents and their children co-construct a sense of family; (b) parenting routes and their repercussions for the couple and/or in family relations; (c) prejudice against sexual diversity, social support, and the impact on family relationships; (d) literary and media representations and expectations regarding gay and lesbian parenting. Conclusions: The results showed that most Brazilian research focuses on families headed by lesbian parents that had access to parenthood through reproductive technologies. The most used methodological strategies were cross-sectional designs, snowball sampling, individual semi-structured interviews, and content analysis. The quality assessment indicated that most studies did not describe researchers’ positionality. Policy Implications: Theoretical and empirical research in Brazilian is required to better address family-based stigma and discrimination. However, the present study’s findings can also guide future research and interventions in health care and promotion designed to minimize risks or exposure to adversities and strengthen resilience processes in such family configurations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examines the impact of message fatigue and what makes people fatigued in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected with a Qualtrics panel (N = 744) showed that both active (i.e., reactance) and passive (i.e., inattention) resistance in message processing mediated the relationships between message fatigue and intentions to follow three types of preventive behaviors against COVID-19 (i.e., wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands). The indirect effect of message fatigue on intention to seek COVID-19 information was explained by inattention but not reactance. Analyses of open-ended responses identified 18 types of COVID-related information that individuals were tired of hearing about. About 73.38% of participants (n = 546) reported that they were tired of hearing about at least one type of information about COVID-19, with mask-wearing being the most frequently mentioned (21.91%). The results extend existing research on message fatigue-evoked resistance to persuasion and provide practical implications for public health message design. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Parents play a vital role in mediating children’s media use, especially at a young age. We examined the link between the media use of younger children and the media use, attitude toward media, and parenting styles of parents. One thousand and twenty parents of children between 4 and 6 years of age completed a questionnaire on their media use, positive and negative attitudes on media, parenting styles, and the media use of their children. Multigroup structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that there was a significant positive relation between the parent’s media time and the child’s daytime and nighttime media use. Additionally, the parent’s positive attitude toward media use was positively related to the child’s daytime media use, but not the child’s nighttime media use, while the parent’s negative attitude toward media was not associated with the child’s daytime and nighttime media use. Further, among the seven parenting styles, material rewards and autonomy were positively associated with the child’s daytime media use. Discipline was negatively related to the child’s nighttime media use, whereas material rewards were positively associated with the child’s nighttime media use. Collectively, the parent’s positive attitude toward media use was the strongest predictor of the child’s daytime media use, and material rewards were the strongest predictor of the child’s nighttime media use. These results can be of significant use to inform policymakers, researchers, and parents regarding the development of parental guidelines on children’s media use. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, does more internet and social media use lead to taking more-or less-effective preventive measures against the disease? A two-wave longitudinal survey with the general population in mainland China in mid-2020 found that during the COVID-19 pan-demic, internet and social media use intensity promoted the adoption of nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical antipandemic measures. The first wave of data (n = 1014) showed that the more intensively people used the internet/social media, the more they perceived the threat of the pandemic, and took more nonpharmaceutical preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and washing hands) as a result. The second wave (n = 220) showed firstly the predicted relationship between internet/social media use intensity and the perceived threat of the pandemic and the adoption of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures by cross-lagged analysis; secondly, the predictive effect of internet/social media use on the adoption of pharmacological measures (i.e., willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19) and the mediating role of perceived pandemic threat were verified. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of the internet and social media use in the fight against COVID-19 in specific macrosocial contexts. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Education and learning have been significantly impacted by ICT. The purpose of this project is to create a new model and conduct confirmatory factor analysis in order to better understand how students utilize ICT in the classroom. An additional aim is to study, based on students’ attitudes and aspirations to utilize ICT for digital learning, their fundamental computer abilities, mediarelated skills, WBS, and adoption of digital learning technologies, by surveying students at Bisha University and King Faisal University. Structural equations modeling (SEM)-AMOS was used to survey 711 university students, and this study used an improved version of the Technology Acceptance Paradigm (TAM) approach as its research paradigm, as well as quantitative data collection and analytic methodologies. Students’ comments were divided into seven categories and analyzed to identify their attitudes toward and intentions for using ICT in learning environments. BCS, mediarelated abilities, and WBS all had a substantial influence on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, according to the research. This model, which was based on research, was successful in describing students’ attitudes and intentions about using ICT for digital learning. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Not all animals are perceived in the same way given the types of crimes of abuse and neglect that are included in the Spanish Criminal Code and the penalties for such crimes. The aim of this study was to assess public opinion (based on sex, age, location, pet ownership) on issues related to animal attributes (based on animals’ rights, whether they are considered sentient beings, and the responsibilities of humans toward them), the importance given to penalizing animal abuse, and which authority is considered the most appropriate for resolving such cases. A questionnaire based on a Likert-type scale attitude assessment model was responded to by 1,473 individuals (40.6% male; 59.5% female). In addition to demographic characteristics, seven statements were included to evaluate a person’s perception of the capacity of animals to feel pain and to suffer, and the animal's status within the family sphere. Three statements were designed to quantify respondents’ perceptions of punishment based on the context in which the abuse occurs. Four statements measured respondents’ perceptions of the role of a judge and the role of a mediator in penalizing animal abuse. The last section of the questionnaire included a question on the type of penalty that is appropriate for punishing those convicted of animal abuse. The study confirmed that humans differentiate animals based on how emotionally close to humans is the animal with which we form an attachment. In addition, the responses of women, young persons, urban dwellers, and pet owners were more sensitive to an animal's position in society. Respondents expressed greater agreement with fines rather than prison sentences as a punishment for animal abuse. © 2021 International Society for Anthrozoology (ISAZ).

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the use of social media by students in the Faculty of Education, University of Kuwait. The study was conducted within the context of the socio-cultural characteristics of Kuwait, and was underpinned by Alsaied’s (2017) Social Media-Learning Performance model, designed for female Arab students. A volunteer sample of 35 Kuwaiti undergraduate students (88.6% female) was interviewed. Students reported frequently using social media informally for socialization and entertainment, but less frequently as a formal educational tool. Most of the students perceived that social media facilitated interaction with peers, interaction with faculty, engagement, and collaborative learning. However, technical difficulties, and certain negative attitudes towards women using social media, were identified. We recommend that Kuwait University needs to harness the full benefits of social media for teaching and learning and to formulate official guidelines to control the use of social media by all faculty members and students. © 2022 by the authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas.

AB  - Purpose: The authors sought to unpack the paradox between increasing demand for probiotics products against inconclusive scientific evidence about the effectiveness. This paper investigated public understanding of the composition and benefits of probiotic products, measured trust in news media and scientists as sources of information about probiotic products and informational and attitudinal predictors of consumer trust in the news media and scientists. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst a representative sample of 2000 UK consumers. Participants responded to multiple-choice questions and psychometric scales capturing probiotics knowledge, consumption, information seeking behaviour, attitudes to and confidence in the news media and probiotics scientists. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA and hierarchical regression modelling were performed. Findings: Information exposure to probiotics content was highest from traditional media followed by online channels. Levels of confidence in probiotics scientists were higher than in the news media, even though these levels were highest amongst current consumers and lowest amongst non-consumers. Conflicting information, health consciousness and trust in nutrition stakeholders were identified as important predictors of trust in news media and scientists. Originality/value: This study provides a large-scale nationally representative overview of public attitudes and sentiments related to probiotic products with a focus on attitudes towards the news media and the scientific establishment. The findings suggest a need for better consumer awareness about the state of science around probiotic products, interventions that could enable consumers to discern conflicting evidence or news reports, and critical skills that can render them more resilient to online misinformation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The sudden COVID-19-induced transition from a physical university life to a virtual one was a painful one for many students. Social distancing measures mean more than a simple change from face-to-face to online education. This study investigates how different social aspects, such as the students’ psychological sense of community, social capital, and use of social media, facilitated the perceived social support during the transition to the COVID-19 lockdown. Our results not only underline social media’s role, but also indicate that the perceived social support, as well as the bonding and bridging social capital, were particularly relevant during the transition process. Our findings are aimed at organizational management by recommending actionable ways in which they could improve social support by organizing computer-supported social networks, social support predictors, and specialized interventions for students with less perceived social support. As such, the study provides unique insights into the COVID-19-induced lockdown situation among students, while offering a transition model that also generalizes to other settings. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: The consumption of animal-based food products faces several sustainability challenges. To date, however, meat intake plays an important role in everyday food choices. With their ability to change the opinions of a critical mass, opinion leaders in food choices are assumed to play a predominant role in influencing future dietary styles. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify opinion leaders in food choices and their personal meat consumption behaviour as well as their attitude towards policy interventions aiming to meat reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 1,479 German participants aged between 15 and 29 years who were online surveyed in autumn 2020. A latent profile analysis (LPA) identified three distinct groups of opinion leader in the younger generation labelled “non-opinion leaders”, “weak opinion leaders” and “opinion leaders”. The identified profiles were used to understand opinion leaders and their food choices by using chi-square tests as well as univariate ANOVA with Tukey or Games-Howell post hoc tests. Findings: Opinion leadership in food choices was associated with a higher interest in meat-reduced dietary styles and with more positive attitudes towards innovative food ideas. Moreover, opinion leaders were associated with politicised food decisions, indicating that their food choices align with their political and social interests. Originality/value: The results contribute to a better understanding of the development of future dietary styles, provide evidence for a shift towards more sustainable dietary patterns in the near future and highlight that food decisions are no longer solely decisions on an individual basis but rather becoming of political relevance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Between 2010 and 2015, as Myanmar transitioned from authoritarian rule to a more liberal and democratic state, its Muslim population increasingly faced hate speech and violence. This article goes beyond analyses that regard the growing anti-Muslim sentiment as a consequence of a liberalized media environment, enabling people to voice long-standing grievances and prejudice. Rather, the notion of a “Muslim threat” to Myanmar’s Buddhist population is approached as the outcome of a dynamic process of securitization in which an alliance of political and religious elites was forged whose discourse changed the rules of the political field, forcing the reform-oriented opposition into strategic silence. It is argued that in the early period of liberalization, anti-Muslim frames were normalized and thus shaped the securitization of Muslims. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - These days, advertisers make every effort to attract users through coercive exposure, so as to achieve web-advertisement performance. However, the validity of crediting actual performances through forced exposure is a moot point, because accompanied unwanted digressive advertisements and unintended mouse clicks imposed on the user, are nuisance factors that can culminate in a negative way. Hence, this study investigates advertisement performance in an elaborate way by focusing on varying effects of coercive exposures. Moreover, when considering advertisement performance, it is appropriate to examine advertisement fit, that is, whether the advertising contents match with services provided by the host website. The results showed that, when subjectively forced to frequent unsolicited advertisement, a user’s negative attitude to the respective advertisement greatly impacts on advertisement performance. Furthermore, if the level of advertisement fit is low, negative attitude is strengthened. This study provides guidelines on more appropriate ways for performing web advertisement, to achieve a genuine performance of advertisement and provide practical web-advertisement strategies for advertisers. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The Internet, specifically social media, is among the most common settings where young people encounter hate speech. Understanding their attitudes toward the phenomenon is crucial for combatting it because acceptance of such content could contribute to furthering the spread of hate speech as well as ideology contamination. The present study, theoretically grounded in the General Aggression Model (GAM), investigates factors associated with online hate acceptance among young adults. We collected survey data from participants aged 18–26 from six countries: Finland (n = 483), France (n = 907), Poland (n = 738), Spain (n = 739), the United Kingdom (n = 959), and the United States (n = 1052). Results based on linear regression modeling showed that acceptance of online hate was strongly associated with acceptance of violence in all samples. In addition, participants who admitted to producing online hate reported higher levels of acceptance of it. Moreover, association with social dominance orientation was found in most of the samples. Other sample-specific significant factors included participants’ experiences with the Internet and online hate, as well as empathy and institutional trust levels. Significant differences in online hate acceptance levels and the strength of its connections to individual factors were found between the countries. These results provide important insights into the phenomenon, demonstrating that online hate acceptance is part of a larger belief system and is influenced by cultural background, and, therefore, it cannot be analyzed or combatted in isolation from these factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of universities in promoting sustainability and sustainable development goals among Indian students as future entrepreneurs, supporting the mission of sustainability. Using PLS-SEM (n = 422), we checked the influence of three constructs related to the university’s role, i.e., campus sustainability, environmental sustainability, and education on sustainability at the university, on attitudes towards sustainability among students, on one hand, and on the intention to start entrepreneurship for sustainability, on the other hand. We also looked into the impact of attitude towards sustainability-related entrepreneurship on the intention to start entrepreneurship for sustainability, as well as into the mediating role of attitude on the relationship between the three mentioned constructs and sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. Results suggest that campus sustainability and education on sustainability positively influence the attitude towards sustainability of the students. Additionally, campus sustainability and environmental sustainability influence students to start entrepreneurship for sustainability. Further, a positive attitude towards sustainability-related entrepreneurship impacts the sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. Attitude towards sustainability mediates the relationship of campus sustainability and environmental sustain-ability with the sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. The study will be helpful for the universities, students, researchers, and curriculum developers to understand the role of educational institutes and its policies towards sustainability in shaping the intentions towards sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Despite a campaign of effective educational interventions targeting knowledge, atti-tudes, and prevention, Human Immunodeficiency-Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) continues to be a significant public health issue in India, with Mizoram reporting the highest HIV/AIDS cases in 2018–2019. In this study, we extracted Mizoram state from the National Family Health Survey Fourth Series (NFHS-4) 2015–2016 datasets and investigated factors associated with respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and prevention towards HIV/AIDS. The sample included 3555 adults aged 15–49 years residing in Mizoram, North-east India. Respondents who reported having ever heard of HIV/AIDS was 98%. Multivariate analysis indicated that the probability of having inadequate knowledge of HIV/AIDS was higher among those with no schooling, who were illiterate, of non-Christian faiths, belonging to backward tribes or caste, from poor households, and those who lived in rural areas, not exposed to media. The odds of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AIDS transmission was high among females (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI 2.34–4.16), respondents aged 35–39 years (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.05–2.87) and those belonging to other backward class. The HIV/AIDS knowledge of respondents was found to be encouraging as the majority (98%) were considered to have a good level of understanding of the condition. An educational intervention to reduce the number of adults 15–49 years infected with HIV/AIDS in Mizoram should target those from low socioeconomic groups, those from non-Christian religions, and those from other backward classes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - The large-scale infection of COVID-19 has led to a significant impact on lives and economies around the world and has had considerable impact on global public health. Social distancing, mask wearing and contact tracing have contributed to containing or at least mitigating the outbreak, but how public awareness influences the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches remains unclear. In this study, we developed a discrete compartment dynamic model to mimic and explore how media reporting and the strengthening containment strategies can help curb the spread of COVID-19 using Shaanxi Province, China, as a case study. The targeted model is parameterized based on multi-source data, including the cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered individuals, the daily number of media-reporting items and the imported cases from the rest of China outside Shaanxi from January 23 to April 11, 2020. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of media reporting and imported cases on transmission. The results revealed that reducing the intensity of media reporting, which would result in a significant increasing of the contact rate and a sizable decreasing of the contact-tracing rate, could aggravate the outbreak severity by increasing the cumulative number of confirmed cases. It also demonstrated that diminishing the imported cases could alleviate the outbreak severity by reducing the length of the epidemic and the final size of the confirmed cases; conversely, delaying implementation of lockdown strategies could prolong the length of the epidemic and magnify the final size. These findings suggest that strengthening media coverage and timely implementing of lockdown measures can significantly reduce infection. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Introduction: Orbital impalement is a serious and potentially life-threatening trauma if the brain or vessels at the base of the skull are affected. The authors report the results and aftermath of the management of a case of post-traumatic retention of an intra-orbital metallic foreign body. Case presentation: A 5-year-old boy was struck by a motorcycle while crossing a road. His head struck the handlebars of the motorcycle with a left facial-orbital impact point. The examination revealed a foreign body penetrating the orbit at the level of the left upper eyelid with limitation of adduction. The radiological assessment confirmed the intra-orbital presence of the foreign body with probable fracture of the inner wall of the eyeball. Surgical exploration through the palpebral wound revealed an intact eyeball and an incarceration of the medial rectus muscle by a fracture of the internal wall. After delicate and meticulous removal of the foreign body, hemostasis was ensured and the wound was sutured. The evolution was satisfactory, without sequelae or visual prejudice. Discussion: Imaging, i.e. a CT scan and a standard X-ray, is necessary to evaluate the lesions before adapting a therapeutic attitude. The choice of the approach for extraction must meet two cardinal concerns: extraction of the foreign body and minimal dissection or manipulation of the noble structures of the eye and its adnexa. Conclusion: Intra-orbital foreign bodies are rare but potentially serious. The type of the foreign substance, its intra-orbital extension and related lesions, as well as the extraction process, all influence the prognosis. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Two studies (N1 = 193; N2 = 598) were conducted in Poland to examine the role of two types of ingroup commitment (i.e., national narcissism and national identification) as predictors of attitudes towards immigrants and refugees (disadvantaged groups) and intentions to engage in collective action against them. As predicted, national narcissism (but not national identification) was related to more hostile intergroup attitudes and greater willingness to engage in collective action against refugees and immigrants. The positive effect of national narcissism on intentions to engage in collective action against immigrants and refugees was mediated by attitudes towards those groups. These results show that applying a more fine-grained approach to ingroup commitment (e.g., national narcissism vs. national identification) among advantaged group members allows for a better understanding of their intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions to actively oppose the rights of disadvantaged social groups via collective action. © 2021

AB  - Non-conventional terrorism (NCT) incorporates an extended dimension of uncertainty that can lead to fear among the public. Health officials have an unsubstantiated assumption that thousands will seek treatment in hospitals following NCT. This study aims to examine public behavioral intentions in the case of NCT and the effect of risk communication on intents. An online randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1802 adult participants in Israel. Threat perception and behavioral intent before and after exposure to hypothetical NCT scenarios were assessed stratified to the type of media, exposure to rumors, and risk communication. The majority (~64%) of participants are aware of the NCT threat. Almost half (45%) of participants indicated a “high” or “very high” chance of seeking medical attention following an NCT incident. Regression analysis suggests that the odds of participants exposed to risk communication to report an elevated intent of seeking medical attention were 0.470 (95% CI: 0.359, 0.615) times that of participants not exposed to risk communication, χ2 = 30.366, p &lt; 0.001. The findings demonstrate the importance of effective risk communication in reducing undesired public behavior during NCT crises. Efforts must be invested to create a robust risk communication infrastructure to allow the proper management of possible NCT incidents. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Assumptions about dogs’ personality are influenced by their appearance, which may lead to differences in ownership styles and subsequent canine welfare. The influence of canine appearance on observers’ emotion attributions to dogs remains largely unexplored. This study investigated whether canine head shape is related to how both dog owners and non-dog owning adults in the U.K. attribute emotions to still images of dogs, and in the case of dog owners, to their own dogs. Attachment, respondent personality and dog trainability were assessed as potential influences on emotional attribution in owners. Overall, 2451 participant responses were received. Still images of mesocephalic dogs were attributed primary and positively valenced emotion with more strength and frequency than other groups. Mesocephalic images were also attributed negatively valenced emotions less frequently and with less strength than other groups. Apart from empathy, no significant differences were found in emotional attribution to owned dogs of different head shapes; however, human personality influenced attribution of emotions to owned dogs. The finding that some dogs are attributed emotions more readily based on their appearance alone has applied importance, given, for example, the potential for misattribution of positive emotions to dogs in negative emotional states, and potential prejudice against dogs considered in negative emotional states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This study evaluated the relationship between drivers’ cognitive biases (i.e., optimism bias, illusion of control) and risky driving behaviour. It also investigated the mediational role of risk perception in the relationship between cognitive biases and self-reported risky driving. The sample included 366 drivers (Mage = 39.13, SD = 13.63 years) who completed scales measuring optimism bias, illusion of control, risk perception, and risky driving behaviour, as well as demographic information. The results showed that risky driving behaviour was negatively predicted by optimism bias and positively predicted by the illusion of control. Further, risk perception negatively correlated with risky behaviour and also mediated the relation between both optimism bias and illusion of control with risky driving. The practical implications of these results for traffic safety and future research are discussed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide. This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data (n = 735) collected in 2017–2020 on the Finnish population. Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data (n = 840) collected in 2019–2021 representing the Finnish working population. We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis. A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic. Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic, psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population. Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals. The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic. Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The purpose of this retrospective observational study was to identify the impact of COVID-19 on emergency medical services (EMS) processing times and transfers to the emergency department (ED) among patients with acute stroke symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Busan, South Korea. The total number of patients using EMS for acute stroke symptoms decreased by 8.2% from 1570 in the pre-COVID-19 period to 1441 during the COVID-19 period. The median (interquartile range) EMS processing time was 29.0 (23–37) min in the pre-COVID-19 period and 33.0 (25–41) minutes in the COVID-19 period (p < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the number of patients transferred to an ED with a comprehensive stroke center (CSC) (6.37%, p < 0.001) and an increase in the number of patients transferred to two EDs nearby (2.77%, p = 0.018; 3.22%, p < 0.001). During the COVID-19 pandemic, EMS processing time increased. The number of patients transferred to ED with CSC was significantly reduced and dispersed. COVID-19 appears to have affected the stroke chain of survival by hindering entry into EDs with stroke centers, the gateway for acute stroke patients. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Opinions about cognitive enhancement (CE) are context-dependent. Prior research has demonstrated that factors like peer pressure, the influence of authority figures, competition, moral relevance, familiarity with enhancement devices, expertise, and the domain of CE to be enhanced can influence opinions. The variability and malleability of patient, expert, and public attitudes toward CE is important to describe and predict because these attitudes can influence at-home, clinical, research, and regulatory decisions. If individual preferences vary, they could influence opinions about practices and regulations due to disagreements about the desirable levels of risks and benefits. The study of attitudes about CE would benefit from psychological theories that explain judgments. In particular, we suggest that variability in risk and benefit sensitivity could psychologically mediate judgments about CE in many contexts. Drawing from prospect theory, which originated in behavioral economics, it is likely that framing effects, shifted reference points, and the tendency to weigh losses (risks) more heavily than gains (benefits) predict decisions about CE. We suggest that public policy could benefit from a shared conceptual framework, such as prospect theory, that allows us to describe and predict real-world decisions about CE by patients, experts, and the public. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In July 2021, breakthrough cases were reported in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, sparking concern and discussion about the vaccine’s effectiveness and becoming a trending topic on Sina Weibo. In order to explore public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and their emotional orientations, we collected 1542 posts under the trending topic through data mining. We set up four categories of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, and used a big data analysis tool to code and manually checked the coding results to complete the content analysis. The results showed that 45.14% of the Weibo posts (n = 1542) supported the COVID-19 vaccine, 12.97% were neutral, and 7.26% were doubtful, which indicated that the public did not question the vaccine’s effectiveness due to the breakthrough cases in Nanjing. There were 66.47% posts that reflected significant negative emotions. Among these, 50.44% of posts with negative emotions were directed towards the media, 25.07% towards the posting users, and 11.51% towards the public, which indicated that the negative emotions were not directed towards the COVID-19 vaccine. External sources outside the vaccine might cause vaccine hesitancy. Public opinions expressed in online media reflect the public’s cognition and attitude towards vaccines and their core needs in terms of information. Therefore, online public opinion monitoring could be an essential way to understand the opinions and attitudes towards public health issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Covid-19 infection is a serious threat to health care workers (HCW) because it is primarily spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or talking. Therefore, how HCW exposure to COVID 19 virus translates into risk of infection is thus critical for informing infection prevention and control (IPC) recommendations. Aim: This study assessed the risk perception, risk involvement/exposure and compliance to preventive measures to COVID-19 among nurses in a tertiary hospital in Asaba Nigeria. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey (Census method) was used to recruit to the study, the entire 378 nurses in a tertiary hospital in Asaba, who met the inclusion criteria. There was no sampling as the population was few. For the participatory observation of the respondents, each ward had research assistant who is a nurse selected from the unit and trained on data collection for the study. Results: A subset of the nurses (9.3%) in the study centre strongly agree that Covid-19 is a mirage, and 2.6% also agree that the pandemic does not exist, while 37.8% agree that the pandemic is being politicized. Many of the nurses 141(37.3%) had contact with the environment where Covid-19 patients were cared for. For the participatory observation, decontamination of high touch surfaces was poor in most of the units. Personal protective equipment were lacking in some medical wards as only 2(50%) of the wards had all the PPE available at the time of the study. Conclusion: Some of the infection preventive measures for Covid 19 were neglected by the nurses, and this calls for reminder in the form of posters at strategic spots in the hospital and further trainings on IPC. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and barriers related to medication adherence in older patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Methods: A total of 272 older patients with CHD were investigated by the Chinese version of the Medication Adherence Scale. The score ranges for the knowledge, attitudes, and barrier subscales were 0–30, 0–30, and 0–110, respectively. Higher scores indicate more knowledge, positive attitudes, and more barriers related to medication adherence. Results: The median scores of knowledge, attitudes and barriers were 25.5, 28, and 8, respectively. Having stents, living alone, good financial status and fewer chronic diseases were related to more knowledge. Younger age, having no stent, and more chronic diseases were associated with more barriers. Patients with good financial status and higher age had more positive attitudes. Conclusions: Understanding older patients’ knowledge, attitudes, and barriers related to medication adherence and their associated factors can help develop tailored interventions in medication adherence studies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This essay analyses the French film 120 BPM (Campillo 2017) in relation to its aesthetics and critical reception in the context of scientific advances in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) therapy, as well as revised socio-cultural attitudes towards, and political strategies for dealing with, the disease. It argues that the treatment trajectory of the virus has been paralleled by a transition in the way that the disease is both represented and received in media, film, and television. This is because advances in therapy and understanding of the disease now render it much less threatening, and, although AIDS remains a serious public health concern in certain regions, public attitudes towards the virus have correspondingly shifted. Such a refocusing reverberates in the visual style of 120 BPM, particularly its cinematography and framing, which consistently positions the spectator amidst the HIV/AIDS community. Although the film focuses on a period in the 1990s when survival rates were still low and death rates rising, it was paradoxically released at a time of relative optimism regarding the prognosis for HIV/AIDS, and thus presents a more upbeat narrative that achieved widespread critical acclaim. © 2021 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.

AB  - Introduction: Public awareness regarding COVID-19 plays an important role in controlling the virus’ spread and treating infected people. A high level of awareness among the public will help to implement preventive measures, particularly in the most populated regions, such as Makkah, Saudi Arabia. COVID-19 is an infectious disease and the Saudi Arabian government has taken serious precautions and implemented several preventive measures. In addition, The Ministry of Health (MOH) has launched many awareness campaigns and provided COVID-19 vaccines for free. The objectives: To assess the Public's level of health awareness and knowledge toward SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 vaccines among residents of Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Makkah region from February 23 to March 2, 2021. The questionnaire was generated using a Google form and distributed online through social platforms such as Twitter and WhatsApp. The questionnaire consisted of five sections and six hundred participants have answered and completed all questions. Then, All data were imported into Microsoft Excel and analyzed using the statistical tools SAS version 9.4 and SPSS version 25 software. Results: A total of 600 participants from the Makkah region were found to have a high level of awareness and knowledge about all aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease. For example, all participants considered coronavirus to be contagious, and 89.8% of them knew that COVID-19's symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu. Most respondents showed a high level of awareness regarding the main factors of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Over 98.7% of respondents were aware of the role of gatherings and events in further spread of the virus. The participants showed a good level of awareness about other preventive measures, such as maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask. However, the respondents considered COVID-19 vaccines to be effective, but some of them were not aware of their side effects, and 38.8% planned to receive a vaccine. Conclusion: The residents of Makkah showed a high level of awareness about these aspects; an excellent awareness level was noted for SARS-CoV-2, means of transmission, disease symptoms and prevention of viral spread. On the other hand, the participants had less knowledge regarding COVID-19 vaccines; hence, more effort is required to educate people about the safety and benefits of the vaccines. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - With the growing rise of Islamophobia in Canada, this study looks at Muslim women's experiences of Islamophobia, how they are impacted and how they respond to Islamophobia in the Canadian context. It also explores how Muslim women feel about being Muslim in Canada in relation to their identities. This study was conducted through individual semi-structured interviews with five Muslim women in the greater Toronto area. Findings from this study reveal how Muslim women experience a hypervisibility of their Muslim identity and how this shapes the way they regulate themselves in public. Muslim women in this study speak about how they are seen as Un-Canadian by others and share about the community-wide impacts of Islamophobia. Findings from this study demonstrate how Muslim women respond to Islamophobia in several different ways including activism, spreading awareness in the media and connecting more with the larger community. A key finding of this study includes how Muslim women describe their resilience and continue to persevere in the face of Islamophobia, thereby generating counter-narratives to dominant stereotypical tropes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: The early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant disruptions in provision of maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with fragile health systems, such as Nigeria. Measures taken to ‘flatten the curve’ such as lockdowns, curfews, travel restrictions, and suspension of public services inadvertently led to significant disruptions in provision of essential health services. In these countries, health facility leaders are directly responsible for driving changes needed for service delivery. Objective: To explore perspectives of health facility leaders in Lagos, Nigeria, on solutions and adaptations implemented to support MNCH service provision during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Key informant interviews were remotely conducted with purposively sampled 33 health facility leaders across primary, secondary, and tertiary public health facilities in Lagos between July and November 2020. Following verbatim transcription of recordings, data familiarization, and coding, thematic analysis was used to synthesize data. Results: Health facility leaders scaled down or discontinued outpatient MNCH services and elective surgeries. However, deliveries, newborn, immunization, and emergency services continued. Service provision was reorganized with long and staggered patient appointments, collapsing of wards and modification of health worker duty rosters. Some secondary and tertiary facilities leveraged technology like WhatsApp, webinars, and telemedicine to support service provision. Continuous capacity-building for health workers through training, motivation, psychological support, and atypical sourcing of PPE was instituted to be able to safely maintain service delivery. Conclusion: Health facility leaders led the frontline of the COVID-19 response. While they took to implementing global and national guidelines within their facilities, they also pushed innovative facility-driven adaptations to address the indirect effects of COVID-19. Insights gathered provide lessons to foster resilient LMIC health systems for MNCH service provision in a post-COVID-19 world. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the “ultimate scapegoat” outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the “context-dependent” outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Mental capacity legislation in the UK is designed to safeguard the rights of people who may need support, or may be unable, to make autonomous decisions. Very limited evidence has been published about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the application of mental capacity legislation and, to our knowledge, none on the ability of speech and language therapists (SLTs) to support people with communication disabilities to engage in decision-making. Aims: To describe how UK SLTs supported people with communication disabilities to make decisions and participate in mental capacity assessments, best interests decision-making and advance care planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods & Procedures: This descriptive, cross-sectional study used an online survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data about SLTs’ practice experiences between August and November 2020. SLTs working with a range of adult clinical populations in different care settings were sampled purposively from all UK jurisdictions. Participants were recruited through professional networks and social media. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Outcomes & Results: Data were collected from 107 SLTs working in a range of settings across all four UK nations. The sample included SLTs working with people with neurological conditions, learning disabilities, mental health conditions and acute confusion. The need for SLT support appeared to increase during the pandemic. Most respondents were still able to offer support; however, the amount and nature of support varied. Quality of support was impacted by adjustments associated with social distancing and infection control restrictions. Personal protective equipment (PPE) was identified as a barrier to communication. Indirect working methods (e.g., telehealth) were inaccessible to some people with communication disabilities. Most respondents felt confident that legal requirements were upheld, but suggested this group was less able to engage in decision-making and had reduced access to support to manage their own health conditions. Conclusions & Implications: Some SLT services were limited in their ability to meet the decision-making support needs of people with communication disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic due to structural and systemic barriers. This suggests that existing inequities in the provision of care for people with communication disabilities in the UK were amplified during the pandemic. What this paper adds: What is already known on the subject People with communication disabilities may require support from healthcare professionals, including SLTs, to make decisions and communicate their wishes and preferences about their care, in line with mental capacity legislation. There is a lack of published evidence relating to how changes in staff deployment and resource during the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted on the ability of SLTs to provide this support. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study provides novel evidence about the ways in which UK SLTs supported people with communication disabilities to engage in mental capacity assessments, best interests decision-making and advance care planning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In some cases, the amount and quality of decision-making support available was affected negatively due to changes in healthcare delivery and resource management and SLT working practices. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study suggests that some people with communication disabilities experienced greater barriers to receiving professional support to maximize their autonomy and manage their health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Speech and language therapy services and healthcare commissioners should consider how best to ensure equitable service delivery to this population in resource-limited situations. © 2021 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to test knowledge and attitudes of physical educators in Palestine toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy. The study also aimed to identify the variables that were associated with adequate knowledge and positive attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy. Methods: This study was done in a cross-sectional design among physical educators in Palestinian schools. The questionnaire tested knowledge and attitudes of physical educators using 18-item and 12-statement tests, respectively. Results: Complete questionnaires were returned by 226 physical educators (response rate = 75.3%). The median knowledge score of the physical educators on the 18-item knowledge test was 50% [33.0%, 61.0] and the median attitudes score of the physical educators on the 12-statemtns was 50.0% [42.0, 58.0]. Higher knowledge scores were associated with age, teaching experience, educational level, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Higher attitude scores were associated with gender, age, educational level, place of residence, type of school, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Conclusion: Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy were identified among physical educators in Palestine. Appropriately designed interventions are still needed to improve knowledge and correct attitudes of physical educators about epilepsy and students with epilepsy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Emotional experience can influence cognitive estimates such as perceived psychological distance and time judgements. These estimators are crucial in threatening situations like the COVID-19 pandemic because the subjective perception of the closeness of a potential infection might influence behaviour. However, to date it remains unclear how fear affects these estimates. We report on data from N = 183 participants collected in Germany during the summer of 2020, when a “second wave” of COVID-19 infections was still only on the horizon of public awareness. We induced COVID-19-related fear in members of one group and compared their estimates of psychological distance and time judgements to those of a neutral group. Fear induction influenced these conjoint estimates in the way that an increase in infection rates appeared farther away and of shorter duration. Mediation analysis revealed inverse effects of changes in valence and ratings of Fear of COVID-19 on psychological distance. Possible explanations for these effects are discussed. © 2021 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada. National Research Council of Canada.

AB  - Low family income during childhood is associated with multiple enduring negative outcomes, including poorer cognitive functioning in adulthood. However, mechanisms linking low family income during adolescence to adulthood cognitive outcomes are relatively unclear, as mediators of income-cognition links have mostly been examined separately. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal multiple mediation analysis of associations between adolescent family income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory using a large, national dataset (N = 6337). The data were sociodemographically representative of the United States (48.1% male, Madult age=29.01). Potential mediators were education attainment, family education attitudes, stressful life experiences, inflammation, and perceived parental warmth. We found that education attainment mediated the associations between adolescent income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory. Additionally, stressful life events mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood long-term memory, whereas inflammation and family education attitudes mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood working memory. These findings suggest that limited education, less positive attitudes toward education, more stress, and heightened inflammation in low-income families predict poorer cognition in adulthood, and that intervening on each of these factors may mitigate detrimental cognitive sequelae of low family income during adolescence. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed our way of living. To minimize life losses, multi-level strategies requiring collective efforts were adopted while waiting for the vaccines' rollout. The management of such complex processes has taken benefit from the rising framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), and particularly the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) since it is probably the most suitable approach to both the micro (user) and the macro (processes) scale. Hence, a single infrastructure can support both the logistic and monitoring issues related to the war against a pandemic. Based on the COVID-19 experience, this paper is a survey on how state-of-the-art RFID systems can be employed in facing future pandemic outbreaks. The three pillars of the contrast of the pandemic are addressed: 1) use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 2) access control and social distancing, and 3) early detection of symptoms. For each class, the envisaged RFID devices and procedures are discussed based on the available technology and the current worldwide research. This survey shows that RFID could generate an extraordinary amount of data so that complementary paradigms of Edge Computing and Artificial intelligence can be tightly integrated to extract profiles and identify anomalous events in compliance with privacy and security. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study (N = 348 students and 468 adults) examines whether the associations between increased media use during social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and negative emotional states (negative affect, boredom, and depression) depend on individual differences. Transportability is the trait likelihood of becoming mentally and emotionally immersed in story worlds, and need for social assurance is the tendency to rely on others for affiliation and companionship. Theoretically, higher transportability may lead to greater benefits from using entertainment media, whereas need for social assurance has previously been linked with negative outcomes of social media use. In addition, we explored whether media use and its associations differ between college students and older adults. Results suggest that social media use and entertainment media use increased during social distancing, particularly for students. Moreover, increased use of both types of media was associated with more negative emotional states. In particular, those high in need for social assurance used social media more often and reported more negative feelings. In addition, contrary to expectations, the association between entertainment media and depression appeared to be increased by transportability, particularly in older adults. These findings highlight the need for greater understanding of how effects of media use might change during social isolation as well as the need for additional social and mental health support for young adults/students during social distancing © 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic compelled people to engage in social distancing protocols that increased media exposure and transitioned social interactions to digital spaces, providing a unique context to study the compensation function of parasocial relationships (PSRs) with fictional characters and celebrities. Published analyses from a 4-wave panel survey conducted with U.S. adults (N = 166) during the pandemic revealed that decreased face-to-face interactions and increased mediated interactions with friends predicted PSR growth (Bond, 2021). This study concluded that pandemic-induced reliance on screens to engage with real-life friends may have blurred the cognitive distinctions between real-life friends and liked media personae, thereby strengthening PSRs. The present study aimed to further investigate this line of reasoning by incorporating parasocial interaction (PSI) into a secondary analysis of the longitudinal data. Participant-reported liked media personae were coded for their PSI potential, defined as likelihood of engaging audiences in illusory interactions. Results suggest that PSRs experienced significant growth during the pandemic, particularly PSRs with media personae more likely to invoke PSI among those who also increased their mediated social interactions with real-life friends. These findings support and extend the conclusions of the initial analyses: PSRs may serve a compensation function during social distancing, and increased exposure to real-life friends through screen media may blur the lines between the social and parasocial, increasing the value of PSRs during social distancing © 2021.

AB  - The identification-prejudice link describes the defensive stance toward immigrants held by strong national identifiers. Recent research refined this relationship by suggesting that defensive national identification (operationalized through national narcissism), but not secure national identification, was associated with prejudice. While previous research found intergroup threat and conspiracy beliefs to mediate the identification-prejudice link, the need to comprehensively and experimentally test the role of these defensive group beliefs remains in the context of the narcissistic identification-prejudice link. Furthermore, following the group-based control model, we proposed that these defensive group beliefs might be more pronounced among national narcissists compensating for a low personal control. In Study 1 (N = 1104, nationally representative sample), national narcissism, but not secure national identification, was related to prejudice against immigrants, and a serial model composed of perceived intergroup threat and conspiracy beliefs mediated this relationship. These relationships held when controlling for conspiracy mentality, supporting the notion that these conspiracy beliefs were motivated at the intergroup level. In Study 2 (N = 474, pre-registered), we experimentally induced intergroup threat and exposure to conspiracy theories about immigrants. Induced threat increased conspiracy beliefs, and both increased prejudice, corroborating their causal relationship. In Study 3 (N = 350, pre-registered), we induced low personal control and made national narcissism salient to test the group-based control hypothesis. The relationship between measured (but not manipulated) national narcissism and conspiracy beliefs was more pronounced under low personal control. We discuss the role of defensive group beliefs on group-based control and prejudice against immigrants. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly escalated in early 2020 and shelter-at-home orders cascaded around the world, celebrities streamed live performances from living rooms, home studios, and empty opera houses. Social media buzzed with gratitude for the entertainment, inspiration, and camaraderie that developed between ordinary citizens and celebrities sharing music from isolation via media technology. Celebrities also called upon their industry connections and friendships to create collaborative fundraising events, support working musicians whose tours were cancelled, and highlight amateur performers. Musicians who streamed simple performances from relatively modest homes and provided glimpses of their ‘real lives’–their talents, personalities, homes, friendships, and families–won praise from audiences. Touring musicians and theatre performers in particular provide fascinating moments of empowered participatory citizenship during the pandemic. Beloved by relatively small, active fandoms but not widely popular outside their specific genres, these celebrities are positioned to provide meaningful social media connections with their devoted fans while not necessarily garnering high-profile media attention for their efforts. My critical analysis explores how musicians and theatre performers have responded to social distancing by sharing their music and fostering moments of connection with audiences who were seeking comfort during a global crisis. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The land application of biosolids can be subject to questions and concerns, suggesting a gap exists with public perception of biosolids. There is opposition amongst a segment of the population regarding the land application of biosolids in the Southern Interior of British Columbia in Canada. Kamloops and Merritt communities were assessed through a mailout survey to understand better public perceptions of biosolids risks and factors that influence attitudes towards biosolids management. Two thousand surveys were distributed proportionately between the communities. Response rates for Kamloops and Merritt were 22 and 24 percent, respectively. Kamloops and Merritt respondents generally identified differing risk perceptions around biosolids management. Kamloops respondents relative to Merritt were more accepting of the risks associated with biosolids. This acceptance is a likely result of Merritt residents’ recent experience with application sites and proximity to biosolids projects, and the associated negative local media attention. Results from Kamloops highlighted that there is general support to find a productive use of biosolids. This research supports the notion that the ‘beyond compliance’ approach of conducting early engagement to obtain community support proactively may be valuable for any potentially controversial natural resource project, such as with biosolids land application projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Risk evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases can guide the decision-making on various preventive measures, such as initiating or deferring statin therapy. Pharmacists can play an active part in the risk evaluation and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Thus, our study aimed to assess the pharmacists’ knowledge, attitude, perceived barriers, and practices regarding risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 pharmacists using a structured validated questionnaire between November 2020 and February 2021. The Mann–Whitney and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used to analyze the data. Results: A total of 456 pharmacists completed the questionnaire out of 500 distributed (91.2% response rate). Over 60% of participants responded with never or rarely for two out of five cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention practices. The lowest pharmacist-patient counseling practices were for side effects of statin medication (14.5%) and reviewing the patient’s medications to avoid potential statin-drug interactions (31.8%). Participants had a high positive attitude (median = 34 out of 40). The three major barriers for risk assessment were the lack of support (74.8%), the lack of resources (70.6%), and inadequate training (48.7%). Interestingly, having ≤75 customers a day, community pharmacies, PharmD degree, age ≥30 years, and experience ≥6 years were significantly associated (p <.05) with higher CVD prevention activities and counseling practices. Conclusion: Pharmacists have a high positive attitude toward CVD risk assessment. However, they had insufficient knowledge and only provided limited activities and counseling services for CVD prevention and statin therapy. Participants perceived several barriers to CVD risk assessment services in pharmacies. Therefore, it is necessary to remove these impediments for pharmacists to be more involved in CVD risk assessment and prevention. Also, continuing medical education and adequate training for pharmacists are required. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Among sexual minorities, bisexual individuals experience higher rates of victimization and symptoms of PTSD than their lesbian and gay peers as well as heterosexual individuals. Despite these disparities, little work has examined factors contributing to PTSD symptoms among bisexual adults. The current study examined the associations between bisexual-specific minority stress and PTSD symptoms in a sample of adults with bisexual orientation and tested social support as a potential mediator of this association. Participants were 488 adults (378 cisgender women, 49 cisgender men, 61 transgender individuals), ages 18 to 66 years, with bisexual orientation based on identity and/or attraction to multiple genders. Greater anti-bisexual prejudice was associated with greater PTSD symptoms (β = 0.16) and lower social support (β = −.16), while accounting for sociodemographics and sexual identity-based victimization. Social support was associated with lower PTSD symptoms (β = −.25), while accounting for sociodemographics, sexual identity-based victimization, and anti-bisexual prejudice. Mediation analyses indicated that anti-bisexual prejudice was indirectly associated with greater PTSD symptoms through lower social support. Addressing bisexual-specific minority stress and its role in diminishing social support for bisexual individuals represents a critical component of trauma-informed research and intervention development in the bisexual community. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of using narratives to communicate a controversial health issue, gaming disorder, on adolescents’ issue attitudes. In a between-subjects experiment, 115 adolescent participants read either a narrative or an informational message on gaming disorder. Results indicated that compared to the informational message, the narrative health message generated more positive attitudes toward the medical view of problematic gaming and greater attitude certainty. Transportation mediated the narrative’s effect on attitudes. Behavioral involvement moderated the narrative’s effect on attitudes and attitude certainty, such that the positive effects of the narrative on attitudes and attitude certainty were more pronounced for high-involvement adolescents than for low-involvement adolescents. In addition, behavioral involvement also enhanced the effect of message absorption on attitudes. By extending our research on narrative effects to the adolescent population, this study presents findings with both theoretical and practical implications. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, anxiety and depressive symptoms have risen among children and adults. However, it remains unclear why the effects of the pandemic are so salient for certain individuals. This study examined rumination, a well-established risk factor for internalising disorders, as a predictor of prospective increases in anxiety and depression symptoms in mothers and their offspring. Change in rumination during the pandemic was also examined as a predictor of symptom transmission at the dyadic level. Fifty-three biological mother–child dyads were recruited from two longitudinal studies that had completed their respective baselines prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mothers and youth (ages 9–15 years, 77.4% female) completed measures of depression and anxiety symptoms and rumination before and during the pandemic. Results revealed baseline rumination was positively associated with internalising symptom changes for mothers, but not youth. Moreover, pre-to-peri pandemic changes in rumination were associated with prospective increases in mother and youth internalising symptoms. Finally, results revealed a significant correlation for pre-to-peri pandemic depressive symptom change among mothers and youth; however, rumination did not mediate this association. Findings highlight changes in rumination as a potential mechanism for internalising symptom risk during the COVID-19 pandemic across development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Various forms of bias exist in medicine, including race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and weight bias. Weight bias has not received as much attention in the literature as other forms of bias. More often when discussing weight bias, the discussion is with regard to physician to patient bias, or patient to physician. In this article, we summarize the study performed by McLean et al. as well as the podcast and discussion, and social media commentary, in which the investigators evaluate the presence of physician to physician weight bias. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to stay-at-home mandates and lockdowns around the globe. During this time of occupational disruption and social distancing measures, many engaged through online environments. Social media are ever-increasing hosts of occupation and participation, rich with research opportunities. In this study, we explored COVID-19 experiences by analyzing parody videos posted on YouTube by various content creators. We analyzed the lyrics of 27 viral videos (accrued 1 million or more views) by 20 content creators. Using a transactional framework, we identified five themes related to occupational disruption in the lyrics and explored the polarity of the concepts within each theme: old norms vs. new normal, time expanded vs. time condensed, control seeking vs. lack of control, social isolation vs. excess socialization, and cynicism vs. hope. Our findings demonstrated the complex transactions between previous habits and routines, changing spaces of occupation, and meaning of daily occupations within evolving social, economic, and physical contexts. While this study showcased YouTube videos as one untapped source of contextualized knowledge for occupational science, there is a need for further exploration of methodological and ethical challenges of studying digital content. © 2021 The Journal of Occupational Science Incorporated.

AB  - Two pre-registered experiments (Total N = 822) explored the effect of economic inequality on social class stereotyping and the social mechanisms driving this relationship. In both experiments, participants were randomly assigned to a fictitious society with high or low levels of inequality and rated a wealthy and a poor individual on Vertical (i.e., assertiveness and competence) and Horizontal stereotype dimensions (i.e., friendliness and morality). We found that higher (versus lower) inequality caused both social classes to be perceived as more incompetent, immoral, and unfriendly, and the poor to be perceived as more unassertive. Moreover, we found that high (versus low) inequality caused stereotypes of the wealthy and poor to be more different on unique dimensions (i.e., in relation to the poor, the wealthy were stereotyped as more assertive, but also more unfriendly and immoral). Importantly, inequality affected the stereotype dimensions through distinct mechanisms. We found evidence of class-based categorization mediating the effect of inequality and social class stereotypes on the Vertical dimension, and evidence of negative intergroup relations (i.e., increased competition and reduced trust) explaining stereotypes on the Horizontal dimension. Further, we found that social class stereotypes influenced support for redistributive wealth policies. Our work contributes to the literature by identifying the mechanisms through which inequality affects perceptions of the social classes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social media influencers are increasingly employed as product endorsers, and a growing body of academic research confirms that influencers are an effective advertising instrument. However, more research is needed on the specific influencer characteristics driving this success, and the processes responsible for these effects. In this study, we investigated to what extent product-influencer fit and number of followers interact in contributing to positive advertising outcomes and influencer evaluations. Moreover, we investigated to what extent perceived credibility of the influencer and identification with the influencer mediate these relationships. We conducted a 2 (poor vs. good product-influencer fit) X 2 (moderate vs. high number of followers) between-subjects experiment among 432 Dutch Instagram users. Participants were exposed to Instagram posts of health and fitness influencers who endorsed either a protein shake (good-fit) or ice cream (poor-fit). Results showed that fit and number of followers seem to work in tandem: although influencers with a high number of followers are liked more, and their endorsements result in a more positive attitude toward both the ad and product, and a greater likelihood to buy the advertised product as compared to influencers with a moderate number of followers, the endorsed product should fit the influencer’s self-branded image for these positive effects to occur. Moreover, effects were all mediated by perceived credibility and identification, which appear to be important drivers of influencer endorsement effects. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the processes driving audience responses to influencer marketing, and provide clear guidelines for practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Institutional efforts to create safe environments can function as signals to identity safety and reduce expectations of identity threat within the institution. Prior research on institutional identity safety signals, however, has yet to consider an important question: Do people use institutional identity safety signals to inform their expectations of identity threat in their broader social environments? Because people's day-to-day lives are often outside of signaling institutions, it is important to understand whether institutional identity safety signals also influence expectations of identity threat outside of the signaled space. Here, we explore this question by testing how the presence of safe spaces—designated areas where people can feel comfortable in their social identities and safe from prejudice—affect people's expectations of threat in their broader environments. Across four vignette-based studies using US participants sampled from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and an undergraduate subject pool, participants who read about someone observing a safe space sign (compared to signs unrelated to identity safety) reported increased prejudice expectations in their broader environments. These prejudice expectations mediated increased attributions of prejudice (Study 1); motivations to combat prejudice (Study 2); and support for movements and policies addressing diversity, equity, and inclusion (Study 3). These effects were not moderated by group membership. Results suggested that safe spaces increased prejudice expectations because they are perceived as a response to a problem in the broader environment. Together, the present research contributes to existing literature by testing the effects of a new signal (i.e., safe spaces), examining how localized identity safety signals transfer to the broader environment, and highlighting novel outcomes following from prejudice expectations. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of crucial technological and social factors in enhancing or undermining vaccine coverage rates at the country level worldwide. Employing five country-level databases, it explores how different combinations of technology diffusion (that is, social media penetration) and social conditions (functional literacy and attitude toward science) affect the level of vaccine coverage. The analyses are based on two built ad-hoc longitudinal datasets of 36 and 40 countries worldwide, employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) approach. The findings highlight that, at the country level, the absence of high social media penetration, combined with an above-average level of functional literacy and positive attitude toward science, enable vaccine coverage to reach the level recommended by health institutions and authorities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - People living with mental illnesses and their families may conceal their conditions to avoid prejudice and discrimination. Stigma often prevents people from receiving adequate health care and other social support services which could exacerbate social and health consequences such as unemployment, homelessness, substance use, and compulsory hospitalization. In this paper, we discuss social contact as a promising anti-stigma strategy for enhancing social interactions among people with mental illnesses, their families, and those without mental illnesses. In particularly, we consider next steps for an approach that works to reduce the stigma-related burden of mental illness. For social contact to be effective in reducing mental illness stigma, it requires broad social buy-in as well as implementation within care systems. Engagement with this approach can be driven through diverse contact-based education using collaborative efforts of society, academic institutions, policy-makers, health professionals, media, and governments. Ultimately, this work aims to consider the next steps in enacting social contact as an anti-stigma strategy through direct interventions and contact-based education. The success of this approach requires pragmatic public policies to support its implementation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Orienting consumers toward organic eco-friendly beauty products is a societal challenge that resonates with growing environmental concerns following COP 21, when entrepreneurs in the cosmetic industry initiated ambitious plans to increase the proportion of natural components in their products. This study examines how green factors impact customers’ intention to purchase premium organic beauty products. We explore the mediating roles of trust and attitude on this purchase intention, using the SOR paradigm and the dual factor theory, an original approach. Data was collected from 398 respondents using convenience sampling and analysed using the IBM SPSS 22 version and AMOS 22 version package applying structural equation modelling. We show that the mediating role of trust and attitude is of the utmost importance to ensure a sustainable orientation of customers toward organic products. The findings suggest (a) green ads, green brand image and perceived consumer effectiveness positively influence consumers' attitude toward luxury organic beauty products; (b) LOHAS consumption tendency does not impact consumers' attitudes; (c) trust has a significantly negative impact on the consumer's attitude; and (d) likewise, consumers' attitude mediate the intention to purchase luxury organic beauty products. The research has significant implications for understanding India's premium organic beauty goods market and for companies to develop new strategies to market their organic cosmetics. The study also encourages policymakers to provide necessary subsidies to new organic beauty entrepreneurs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Women are often depicted as sex objects rather than as human beings in the media (e.g., magazines, television programs, films, and video games). Theoretically, media depictions of females as sex objects could lead to negative attitudes and even aggressive behavior toward them in the real world. Using the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2002) as a theoretical framework, this meta-analytic review synthesizes the literature on the effects of sexualized media (both violent and nonviolent) on aggression-related thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. Our sample includes 166 independent studies involving 124,236 participants, which yielded 321 independent effects. Overall, the effects were “small” to “moderate” in size (r =.16 [.14–.18]). Significant correlations were found in experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies, indicating a triangulation of evidence. Effects were stronger for violent sexualized media (r =.25 [.19–.31]) than for nonviolent sexualized media (r =.15 [.13–.17]), although the effects of nonviolent sexualized media were still significant and nontrivial in size. Moreover, the effects of violent sexualized media on aggression were greater than the effects of violent non-sexualized media on aggression obtained in previous meta-analyses. Effects were similar for male and female participants, for college students and non-students, and for participants of all ages. The effects were also stable over time. Sensitivity analyses found that effects were not unduly influenced by publication bias and/or outliers. In summary, exposure to sexualized media content, especially in combination with violence, has negative effects on women, particularly on what people think about them and how aggressively they treat them. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Adopting the Critical Discourse Analysis perspective, this study investigates the ideology reflected by the anti-Islam and anti-Muslim discourse in China, the power dynamics revealed by such discourse and how social media discourse differs from and utilises the government discourse. Four ways to disguise the anti-Muslims, anti-Islam prejudice are investigated: appealing to patriotism to demand cultural assimilation; claiming to defend secularism; framing Islam as incompatible with mainstream culture; appealing to consumer rights to reject halal food. Non-Muslims and assimilated Muslims (especially the elites) are found to have the prerogative to dictate who belong to the ingroup, what dietary restrictions are legitimate and whom to blame when undesirable situations arise, while Muslim non-elites are at the receiving end of such dictates. This study also argues that social media discourse expresses antagonism of higher intensity than the government discourse does, and may misappropriate the official narratives to express the interlocutor’s hatred towards Muslims. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - COVID-19 has caused the global pandemic and had a serious impact on people's daily lives. The respiratory droplets produced from coughing and talking of an infected patient were possible transmission routes of coronavirus between people. To avoid the infection, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised to wear face masks while maintaining a social distancing of 2 m. Can the social distancing be reduced if people wear masks? To answer this question, we measured the mass of inhaled droplets by a susceptible manikin wearing a mask with different social distances, which was produced by coughing and talking of an index “patient” (human subject) also wearing a mask. We also used the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology with a porous media model and particle dispersion model to simulate the transmission of droplets from the patient to the susceptible person with surgical and N95 masks. We compared the CFD results with the measured velocity in the environmental chamber and found that the social distancing could be reduced to 0.5 m when people wearing face masks. In this case, the mass concentration of inhaled particles was less than two people without wearing masks and with a social distancing of 2 m. Hence, when the social distancing was difficult, wearing masks could protect people. We also found that the leakage between the face mask and the human face played an important role in the exhaled airflow pattern and particle dispersion. The verified numerical model can be used for more scenarios with different indoor environments and HVAC systems. The results of this study would make business profitable with reduced social distancing in transportation, education, and entertainment industries, which was beneficial for the reopening of the economy. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

AB  - Cybervictimization has been linked to adverse psychological consequences but little is known about the mechanisms linking cybervictimization to lower well-being. We conducted two studies to examine emotional self-efficacy and distinct emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators in the relationship between cybervictimization and lower well-being among German adolescents during the school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. In Study 1, 107 adolescents (Mage = 15.76) reported their cybervictimization frequency, emotional self-efficacy beliefs, and aspects of well-being (i.e., self-esteem, perceived social support, and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 related school closures). Emotional self-efficacy mediated the link between cybervictimization and all well-being measures. Specifically, cybervictimization was related to lower well-being through lower self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. For further examination, in Study 2, 205 adolescents (Mage = 15.45) were asked to report their cybervictimization experiences, use of specific emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, and suppression), and well-being (i.e., self-esteem and life satisfaction). Cybervictimization was related to lower well-being through more rumination, but not through reappraisal or suppression. Taken together, our findings suggest that cybervictims may have lower emotional self-efficacy beliefs and engage in more rumination, a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. These deficits in adolescents’ beliefs and capabilities for effectively managing negative emotions may be accountable for the adverse psychological consequences of cybervictimization. Notably, exploratory analyses suggest that cybervictimization frequency did not increase among adolescents during the lockdown (e.g., homeschooling, social distancing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Essentialist theory (ET) links biological attributions for mental illnesses to pessimistic prognostic beliefs and stigma. The commonsense model (CSM) provides a nuanced framework for studying illness beliefs as shaped by experience. Aims: ET-informed hypotheses linking causal and prognostic beliefs and stigmatizing attitudes concerning depression were tested using CSM constructs with a focus on the moderating effects of self-reported experience with this disorder. Methods: U.S. adults (N = 319) completed online questionnaires assessing depression-related beliefs, attitudes and experience. Multiple regression analysis focused on predictive effects of neurobiological and genetic attributions. Potential mediators (prognosis) and moderators (experience) of the biological attribution-stigma link also were tested. Results: Neurobiological attributions predicted viewing depression as more consequential, longer lasting, and unexpectedly, more treatable. Neurobiological attributions were inversely related to stigma, a link partially mediated by beliefs about depression’s consequences and duration. However, both biological attributions’ relationships to stigma were moderated by experience. Stronger biological attributions predicted less stigma specifically among participants reporting first- or second-hand experience with depression. Conclusion: Experience with depression may shape the relationships of specific causal and prognostic beliefs with depression stigma. Psychoeducation in clinical and public health contexts may be informed by further research using CSM constructs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Increases in racial minority populations are profoundly reshaping the composition of the American electorate, and multiracial identifiers are one of the fastest growing groups. Yet little is known about the political ideology and policy preferences of Americans who identify with more than one race. We address this gap here by examining the political views of the two biggest US multiracial groups—White-Asians and White-Blacks. We also advance prior work by assessing the role that linked fate, racial group closeness, and race salience play in explaining multiracials’ political attitudes. Leveraging the largest national political survey of multiracial adults to date, we find that White-Asian and White-Black multiracials are on the whole more progressive than Whites, expressing levels of linked fate and social and racial attitudes that are comparable to those of their minority race. We argue that the growth in these multiracial populations seems most likely to benefit the Democratic Party. © 2021 Southern Political Science Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pneumonia is one of the very common life-threatening diseases and needs proper diagnosis at an early stage to be cured expeditiously. Medical practitioners use chest X-ray as the best imaging modality to identify pneumonia. Due to the limited facilities available at the remote places and the need of maintaining the social distancing imposed by the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease, one may not have ease of access to a professional radiologist. This article proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that detects pneumonia from X-ray images to assist the medical practitioners located at distant places. The X-ray images are captured as compressed sensing (CS) measurements i.e. very few numbers of samples are observed in order to obtain an energy efficient and bandwidth preserving system to be utilized for far-end pneumonia detection purpose. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach enables the detection of pneumonia with 96.48% accuracy when only 30% samples are transmitted. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This study investigates the antecedents and outcomes of consumer engagement through AR apps and suggests a new conceptual model. The purpose of the paper is to examine how consumer engagement is shaped via AR apps, which eventually leads to a positive attitude towards brand and brand usage intent. To this end, a face-to-face survey instrument was administered to 350 participants in Turkey, where participants tried an AR app and then answered a questionnaire. The structural equation modeling (SEM) and Hayes' Process analyses were applied to test the hypotheses and moderated mediation relationships. Findings showed that interactivity and inspiration are two major antecedents of consumers' flow experience. The flow experience with AR can generate favorable attitudes towards AR apps and more trust in AR apps, which trigger consumer engagement with AR apps and then improve brand attitude and brand usage intent. The outcomes of flow experience with AR (i.e., attitude and trust) mediate the relationship between flow and engagement. Although perceived usefulness increases the effect of consumers' attitudes towards AR on engagement, it has no moderating effect on the relationship between trust in AR and engagement. Furthermore, the results of Hayes' Process revealed that the indirect effect of flow on consumers’ engagement with AR through attitude towards AR is moderated by perceived usefulness. So that, if AR marketers aim to strengthen the link between consumer flow experience and engagement via attitudes towards AR, they should therefore consider enhancing the perceived usefulness of AR. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness had no moderating effect on the indirect relationship between flow and engagement via trust. Finally, this paper discusses both the theoretical and managerial implications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A structured questionnaire was distributed to a total of 531 cat owners in Peninsular Malaysia to evaluate their perceptions toward fleas and flea-borne diseases (FBD) using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) approach. This study showed that majority of cat owners (50.5%) had a moderate level of knowledge on fleas, while 65.3% of them had a relatively low level of knowledge on FBD. However, most of them had positive attitudes (87.9%) and good practices (94.5%) toward efforts on prevention from flea infestation and FBD. Statistical analysis showed significant associations between knowledge on fleas and FBD toward demographic and pet ownership profiles of the respondents. Educated cat owners from urban area were more likely to have positive attitudes toward prevention of fleas and FBD. Female cat owners with monthly income of RM 5,001–7,000 ($1143–1600) were more likely to have good practices. Middle-aged cat owners showed the highest odds toward both positive attitudes and good practices. Correlation analyses indicated significant linear relationships between both knowledge, which were also associated with attitudes, but not with practices. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study relies on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S–O-R) paradigm to explore the mediating role of the desire to stay at the shopping mall in the relationship between shopper positive attitudes towards three atmospheric cues (color schemes, lighting, and music) and the shopping outcomes of shopper satisfaction, positive Word-of-Mouth (WOM) and patronage intentions. Moreover, the study elaborates on the path from the desire to stay to positive WOM and patronage intentions by considering the mediating role of shopper satisfaction. A survey-based study comprising a sample size of 451 mall shoppers has been developed to test the proposed research model. The results indicate that the desire to stay mediates the relationship between shoppers’ positive attitudes towards color schemes and music, on one hand, and shopper satisfaction and positive WOM, on the other hand. Although the desire to stay has a direct effect on positive WOM, it does not directly impact patronage intention. However, the latter path becomes significant when considering the mediating role of shopper satisfaction, indicating that satisfying mall stays enhance desirable outcomes. Based on these findings, implications for theory and retailers are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose/objectives: More and more creative applications are used in the field of dentistry for clinical practice, patient orientation, teaching, and learning, in order to awake the students’ interest and to enable a deep learning and its retention. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact and the effectiveness of the current simulation laboratories on the practical dental education. For this purpose, a survey on a new developed “AR-Demonstrator-App” was conducted during the orthodontic technical courses in 2017, 2018, and 2020 in the Department of Orthodontics (C.G. Carus, TU Dresden, Germany). Methods: With this application, the students had the opportunity to see every single step with instructions on how to manufacture a removable orthodontic device in a compulsory technical course. At the end of these courses, the students were asked to anonymously fill out a printed questionnaire with 12 questions regarding the learning progress related to the app. Results: The yearly mean Likert scores and their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals as well as the yearly median Likert scores suggest a very positive feedback about the use of the new application as an educational instrument. Despite the recognized predominant benefits of this app, the students concluded that they do not prefer the total replacement of the physical plaster casts and that a combination of conventional and computer-based education provided the optimum approach to acquisition of dental practical skills. Conclusions: This survey indicates a generally positive attitude toward computer-assisted simulation systems, providing the facility for acquisition of knowledge and practical skills in a multimedia environment. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Cause-related marketing improves corporate image and consumer attitudes toward brands. An important research gap is how the visual attention paid to cause-related cues in social media affect consumer attitudes and behaviors. In the present study, we analyze the moderating role of the visual attention paid to Instagram-based, cause-related posts on the impact of consumer perceptions (i.e., corporate image), beliefs (trust), and attitudes (i.e., corporate social responsibility [CSR] support) on behavioral intentions (i.e., cause participation, consumer advocacy, and intention to share posts) for fast-food restaurants. Data for the study were collected in a between-subjects experiment with 123 participants. Visual attention was measured using eye-tracking technology, and consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions through an online survey. The results show that the greater the attention paid to images (amount and duration of fixations) and the more revisits made lead to more positive attitudes and behaviors toward the cause and the company. On the other hand, the more time spent looking at the company's responses to negative user-generated content weakens the relationship between trust and consumer advocacy toward the company. These results can help practitioners design appropriate cause-related marketing strategies in social media. © 2021 The Authors. Psychology & Marketing published by Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Decisional balance in quitting smoking involves positive and negative attitudes toward smoking. This study explored the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking, and examined the mediating role of willingness to quit smoking and the moderating role of social support. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 326 daily male smokers from China in 2016, including the decisional balance of smoking, willingness to quit smoking, social support, planning to quit, and nicotine dependence. The results showed: (1) willingness to quit smoking mediated the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking; (2) the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking was moderated by emotional support rather than instrumental support. Smokers with a higher level of emotional support for quitting smoking were more likely to progress to planning to quit smoking, while this relationship was not found among smokers with a lower level of emotional support. These findings suggested that smokers’ willingness to quit smoking would be key to promoting their planning to quit. Meanwhile, the dynamic process of planning to quit smoking was moderated by emotional support from others. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article investigates the relationship between social resentment and Euroscepticism. It argues that that populist parties mobilize the resentment of the losers of modernization by addressing new cultural and political cleavages as well as the issue of European integration. Using survey data from the Belgian National Election Study 2014, the study covers two research objectives. First, we investigate the role of feelings of resentment in citizens’ support for the EU. We theoretically distinguish three constitutive components of resentment–status insecurity, relative deprivation and powerlessness–and empirically test to what extent these feelings drive negative attitudes towards the EU. Second, we uncover how Euroscepticism is embedded in a populist ‘politics of resentment’, paving the way for further inquiry into how the effect of resentment on Euroscepticism is mediated by different types of blame attribution. Our results reveal that feelings of social resentment translate into stronger Euroscepticism. However, the effect on Euroscepticism is primarily mediated by cultural (anti-immigrant) and political (anti-establishment) blame attributions. In this regard, the study presents a more detailed understanding of the roots and processes that drive mass Euroscepticism. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Online journal clubs (JCs) have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic with the resulting social distancing and popularity of online platforms. This systematic review aims to explore current evidence of their use/benefits for clinicians and compare their value to face-to-face (F2F) JCs. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched systematically, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included if they involved clinicians in medical/surgical populations, using an online JC assessing utility, experience and educational value. Quality assessment was undertaken using MERSQI. Results: Fifteen studies were included with findings synthesised into five themes: critical appraisal skills, satisfaction/value, accessibility/environment, evidence-based practice, and preference of online JC. Studies revealed high satisfaction and equivocal or increased preference of online JCs compared to F2F due to ease of access, diverse participation, and less time/cost spent travelling. Online JCs were found to be educationally valuable, aiding development of critical appraisal skills, and promoting change in practice. Disadvantages included lack of discussion intensity, technical issues, and limited interaction on some platforms. Discussion: Online JCs are educationally valuable with high satisfaction rates and distinct advantages/disadvantages to F2F JCs. More high-quality studies are required to elucidate the ideal format to further improve their educational value, utility, and adoption. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Motivation: The public needs to be better informed on the reasons for providing aid, especially that which supports the Sustainable Development Goals. How aid is framed by donors directly affects levels of public support. Purpose: The article investigates support for aid among English-speaking Canadians, and how this varies by the framing of aid spending, socioeconomic markers, personal values and political engagement. Approach and methods: Statistical analysis is undertaken of data from a representative survey of English-speaking Canadians on their knowledge and attitudes with respect to aid to developing countries. A particular focus of the analysis is the influence of the framing of aid spending on public support for aid spending, while controlling for the influence of socioeconomic factors. Findings: Support for increased spending rises when spending is framed relative to the size of the economy, whether in dollar or percentage terms, rather than when framed relative to government taxation or spending. Providing information on the current level of aid spending also raises support for increased aid spending. Overall, when informed about the level of aid spending, most respondents support maintaining or increasing aid. Views on aid vary little by age, education and other socioeconomic markers. People’s values, however, did affect support for aid. Respondents who believe in “Canada first” were considerably more likely to support aid cuts than others. Those who see kindness as part of Canadian identity tend to favour aid, while those who see economic prosperity as part of national identity tend to want aid cuts. While voting intention does not affect views on aid, respondents who have been either politically active or involved in collective action on media/social media are a little more likely to favour increased aid. Policy implications: The findings confirm the importance of the framing of aid spending for designing and implementing programmes to inform, engage and elicit support from the public. Given how values influence public support for aid, engagement needs to be tailored to different target audiences. © 2021 Overseas Development Institute.

AB  - Politics in the current era are replete with unreliable media stories which lack evidence, sometimes disparagingly dubbed “fake news”. A survey on a sample of Muslims in Indonesia (N = 518) in this work found that participants’ endorsement of collective action in of support issues with little to no empirical evidence (i.e., post-truth collective action) increased as a function of their belief in fake news and prejudice against the outgroup (i.e., non-Muslims). Belief in fake news stemmed from participants’ generic and specific conspiratorial thinking, whereas prejudice was positively predicted by relative Muslim prototypicality, denoting how much Muslims in Indonesia view that their group is more representative than non-Muslims of the superordinate Indonesian identity that encompasses both groups. Additionally, our findings revealed that generic conspiratorial thinking and relative Muslim prototypicality were positively predicted by collective narcissism, which in turn spurred participants’ support for collective action by augmenting belief in fake news. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In our tertiary level centre, the oral and maxillofacial (OMFS) rotas often change at short- notice due to service requirements and the development of guidance relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, we have developed a novel teaching method for our dental core trainees (DCTs) to accommodate hectic schedules and conflicting availability between junior and senior staff. Here, we describe the innovative teaching approach we have established using case-based discussions via WhatsApp©. Feedback has been excellent. Respondents have stated that the most useful aspect is flexibility to participate in between tasks and across multiple sites, and 87% stated that they use the searchable summaries when managing patients. This teaching method is highly beneficial for OMFS DCTs. It allows flexibility for fluctuating schedules, is interactive, and provides an easily accessible resource whilst on call. We believe that other teams may benefit from the method if scheduling the time for regular didactic teaching is difficult, or they wish to supplement existing practices. © 2021

AB  - Whilst domestic violence against women receives significant international attention and prominence within the scholarly, media and policy discourses, much silence and reservation is evident in the case of domestic violence against men by women. The dominant societal notion portrays women as the natural victims and men as perpetrators, making it challenging to contextualize men’s experiences of domestic violence in the intimate relationship. Against this backdrop, using Bangladesh as a case study, this article highlights key factors contributing to the silences, subjugations and controversies associated with domestic violence against men in order to present the state of current knowledge for such violence. Currently, there is a paucity of scholarly information on domestic violence against men and policy, legal and social supports available for these victims require attention. It is thus, suggested to break the social prejudice associated with such violence and adopt appropriate policy and legal interventions including gender-neutral laws to protect men at home from violence perpetrated by women. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study investigates whether the declining economic performance and social status of traditional news media, which are two dimensions indicating the professional disruption of journalism, are associated with journalists’ engagement in public relations (PR). The results of a cross-sectional survey reveal two paths to the PR-journalism boundary crossing, although the level of boundary crossing is overall controllable. First, economic disruption indirectly predicts journalists’ engagement in media pitching and media event planning through their identification with colleagues who have engaged in PR. Second, perceived waning social status both directly and indirectly predicts their engagement in media pitching and media catching, with their disidentification with PR practitioners as a mediator in the indirect relationship. These findings suggest that, while professional disruption may induce journalists to seek more information subsidy, their professional identity can be a source of both resistance against and support for this trend. Theories on social identity and intergroup relations are adopted to explain this dilemma. © 2021 The Centre for Chinese Media and Comparative Communication Research, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

AB  - Former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 election victory defied expectations. Trump was an unconventional candidate, and his presidency was true to form. What accounts for his popularity? Integrating work on narcissism with the dual-process motivational model of ideology, we propose that individuals higher in narcissism are more likely to adopt right-wing authoritarian and social-dominance oriented attitudes, which lead them to embrace socially and economically conservative policy positions, respectively. Thus, they are receptive to Trump’s anti-immigration stance, a centerpiece of his political messaging from the campaign trail to the White House. The present study (N = 302) yielded results consistent with this analysis: Right-wing authoritarianism and social-dominance orientation mediated the association between narcissism and Trump support, via social and economic conservatism and immigration attitudes. The study represents an initial test of a potentially generative framework on which future research can elaborate. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The COVID19 pandemic motivated an interesting debate, which is related directly to core issues in urban economics, namely, the advantages and disadvantages of dense cities. On the one hand, compact areas facilitate more intensive human interaction and could lead to higher exposure to the infection, which make them the potential epicenter of the pandemic crisis. On the other hand, dense areas tend to provide superior health and educational systems, which are better prepared to handle pandemics, leading to higher recovery rates and lower mortality rates. The objective of the current study is to test the relationship between COVID19 infection rates (cases÷population) as the dependent variable, and two explanatory variables, population density and socio-economic measures, within two timeframes: May 11, 2020 and January 19, 2021. We use a different methodology to address the relationship between COVID19 spread and population density by fitting a parabolic, instead of a linear, model, while controlling socio-economic indices. We thus apply a better examination of the factors that shape the COVID19 spread across time and space by permitting a non-monotonic relationship. Israel provides an interesting case study based on a highly non-uniform distribution of urban population, and diversified populations. Results of the analyses demonstrate two patterns of change: 1) a significant rise in the median and average infection-population ratio for each level of population density; and 2) a moderate (a steep) rise in infection rates with increased population density on May 11, 2020 (January 19, 2021) for population densities of 4000 to 20,000 persons per square kilometer. The significant rise in the average and median infection-population ratios might be as attributed to the outcome of new COVID19 variants (i.e., the British and the South African mutants), which, in turn, intensify the virus spread. The steeper slope of infection rates and the rise in the standard deviation of the infection-population ratio may be explained by non-uniform spatial distribution of: dissemination of information in a variety of language; different levels of medical infrastructure in different parts of the country; varying levels of compliance to social distancing rules; and strict (limited) compliance to social distancing rules. The last factor of limited compliance might be the outcome of premature optimism due to extensive scope of the vaccination campaign in Israel, which is located in first place globally. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Julian Ochorowicz (1850–1917) belonged to the first generation of psychologists who regarded this discipline as a scientific, positive endeavor. At the same time, he was a representative of psychic sciences, following a strictly positivist attitude to researching psychic phenomena. This article discusses the key event of his career, experiments with the famous medium Eusapia Palladino, in Warsaw, between late 1893 and early 1894. Ochorowicz's séances with Palladino attracted wide local and international attention and improved his standing as an internationally leading psychic researcher. In Warsaw, however, these experiments were fiercely controversial and, as a result, Ochorowicz was discredited and left the city. As I argue, this dissociation of credibilities was the outcome of a changing media landscape in the late nineteenth century. While Ochorowicz's strategy of boundary-work and asserting his credibility aimed at scholarly media, it proved fatal when facing intensive, daily coverage in the popular press. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Of the many changes in daily life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts and governmentally mandated lockdowns were among the most drastic. Coinciding with these changes, popular pornography websites made some previously premium content available for free, spurring dramatic increases in traffic to these websites. This increase in time spent at home and reported increases in traffic to specific pornographic websites led to some speculation that pornography use might generally increase over the course of the pandemic and that problematic use might also increase. To test these speculations and quantify the effects of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on social behaviors on pornography use, we analyzed data from a longitudinal sample of American adults. Baseline, nationally representative data were collected in August 2019 via YouGov (N = 2518). Subsequent data were collected in February 2020 (n = 1677), May 2020 (n = 1533), August 2020 (n = 1470), and October 2020 (n = 1269). Results indicated that, in May 2020, immediately following the height of the first wave of pandemic-related lockdowns, more people reported past-month pornography use than at other follow-up time points, but less did so than at baseline. Among those who reported use in May 2020, only 14% reported increases in use since the start of the pandemic, and their use returned to levels similar to all other users by August 2020. In general, pornography use trended downward over the pandemic, for both men and women. Problematic pornography use trended downward for men and remained low and unchanged in women. Collectively, these results suggest that many fears about pornography use during pandemic-related lockdowns were largely not supported by available data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 challenged our ability to educate incoming surgery interns who depend on early simulation training for basic skill acquisition. This study aimed to create a proficiency-based laparoscopic skills curriculum using remote learning. DESIGN: Content experts designed 5 surgical tasks to address hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and precision cutting. A scoring formula was used to measure performance: cutoff time - completion time - (K × errors) = score; the constant K was determined for each task. As a benchmark for proficiency, a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon performed 3 consecutive repetitions of each task; proficiency was defined as the surgeon's mean score minus 2 standard deviations. To train remotely, PGY1 surgery residents (n = 29) were each issued a donated portable laparoscopic training box, task explanations, and score sheets. Remote training included submitting a pre-test video, self-training to proficiency, and submitting a post-test video. Construct validity (expert vs. trainee pre-tests) and skill acquisition (trainee pre-tests vs. post-tests) were compared using a Wilcoxon test (median [IQR] reported). SETTING: The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas PARTICIPANTS: Surgery interns RESULTS: Expert and trainee pre-test performance was significantly different for all tasks, supporting construct validity. One trainee was proficient at pre-test. After 1 month of self-training, 7 additional residents achieved proficiency on all 5 tasks after 2-18 repetitions; trainee post-test scores were significantly improved versus pre-test on all tasks (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This proficiency-based curriculum demonstrated construct validity, was feasible as a remote teaching option, and resulted in significant skill acquisition. The remote format, including video-based performance assessment, facilitates effective at-home learning and may allow additional innovations such as video-based coaching for more advanced curricula. © 2021 Association of Program Directors in Surgery

AB  - Purpose: To explore public confidence in a COVID-19 vaccine. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: A rural college town in central Pennsylvania. Subjects: Adult residents without minor children. Measures: The primary outcome was COVID-19 vaccination intention. Secondary measures included vaccination attitudes, norms, efficacy, past behavior, trust in the vaccination process, and sociodemographic variables of education, financial standing, political viewpoint, and religiosity. Analysis: Descriptive statistics were used to describe quantitative data. Multivariate ordinal regression was used to model predictors of vaccine intention. Results: Of 950 respondents, 55% were “very likely” and 20% “somewhat likely” to take a coronavirus vaccine, even though 70% had taken the flu vaccine since September 2019. The strongest predictors of vaccine acceptance were trust in the system evaluating vaccines and perceptions of local COVID-19 vaccination norms. The strongest predictors of negative vaccine intentions were worries about unknown side-effects and positive attitudes toward natural infection. Sociodemographic factors, political views, and religiosity did not predict vaccine intentions. Conclusion: Fewer adults intend to take a coronavirus vaccine than currently take the flu vaccine. Traditional sociodemographic factors may not be effective predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Although based on a small sample, the study adds to our limited understanding of COVID-19-specific vaccine confidence among some rural Americans and suggests that traditional public health vaccination campaigns based on sociodemographic characteristics may not be effective. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Because rats are commensal organisms that depend on human activities for food, shifts in human behavior will have pronounced effects on local rat populations. In the spring of 2020, social distancing measures were implemented globally to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This presented a unique opportunity to obtain information regarding the immediate effects of shifts in human behavior on rat populations in a variety of countries. In response to increased sightings of rats in the USA that were reported in American media, we analyzed the changes in the number of public service calls in Tokyo, Japan. We found that the number of calls increased after the implementation of social distancing measures, suggesting that rat sightings had also increased in Tokyo. We then surveyed the changes in the business activities of pest management professionals in the USA, Canada, and Tokyo. We found that the activities were increased in 50 to 60% of the respondents from the USA and Canada. In contrast, 60 to 70% of the respondents from Tokyo answered that their activities were not changed. These results implied that, following the implementation of social distancing measures, rat infestations increased in North America, but not in Tokyo. The survey also suggested that roof rats were considered to be the predominant rodent species in Tokyo. This may account for the limited infestations in Tokyo because roof rats are more sedentary than brown rats. Taken together, our findings suggest that social distancing measures differentially affected rat populations in North America and Tokyo. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between the social inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and technological innovation. It empirically establishes that LGBT inclusion helps foster human capital skills, thus strengthening national innovative capacity. Exploiting cross-country data, this research provides suggestive evidence that social tolerance towards homosexuality is positively correlated with the economic complexity index, a novel measure of cross-country differences in innovative capabilities. Individual-level analyses, based on data from the World Values Survey, reveal that surveyed respondents who self-report tolerance towards homosexual acts tend to have positive attitudes towards technological innovation, ceteris paribus. This lends credence to the international evidence. Further analyses indicate that the link between LGBT inclusion and innovation is partially mediated through the accumulation of human capital. The main findings suggest that the social exclusion of LGBT people, at least to some extent, impedes long-run economic development by hindering innovative activities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Past research has assumed that social egalitarians reject group-based hierarchies and advocate for equal treatment of all groups. However, contrary to popular belief, we argue that egalitarian advocacy predicts greater likelihood to support “Succession”-based ageism, which prescribes that older adults step aside to free up coveted opportunities (e.g., by retiring). Although facing their own forms of discrimination, older individuals are perceived as blocking younger people, and other unrepresented groups, from opportunities— that in turn, motivates egalitarian advocates to actively discriminate against older adults. In 9 separate studies (N = 3,277), we demonstrate that egalitarian advocates endorse less prejudice toward, and show more support for, women and racial minorities, but harbor more prejudice toward (Studies 1 and 2), and show less advocacy for (Studies 3–6), older individuals. We demonstrate downstream consequences of this effect, such as support for, and resource allocation to, diversity initiatives (Studies 3–6). Further, we isolate perceived opportunity blocking as a critical mediator, demonstrating that egalitarian advocates believe that older individuals actively obstruct more deserving groups from receiving necessary resources and support to get ahead (Studies 4–6). Finally, we explore the intersectional nature of this effect (Study 7). Together this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some. © 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant social distancing measures offer a compelling context through which to understand the changing relationship between journalism and place. Through an ethnography of news making at a major Indonesian news broadcaster, this study explored the material settings of news making during the pandemic and the consequences of the place-based realignments on journalistic practice, professionalism, and authority. Four main findings emerged. First, we found that as far as broadcast journalists are concerned there are no alternatives to the newsroom; making news in the newsroom was synonymous with their professional journalistic identity. A second finding is to highlight the key role of place in shaping press-source relations. In our case, the loss of physical proximity to government sources had major consequences for power relations between journalists and authorities. Third, certain news objects held particular meaning for journalists, and that when disrupted, can have deleterious consequences for their professional identity. Finally, our study witnessed an important shift in journalistic routines that favoured the live field report over pre-recorded packages or in-depth analysis. Findings are discussed in the context of ongoing debates about journalistic routines, identities, and the “material turn” in journalism studies. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Public campaigns debating the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) individuals to be treated as equal under the law highlight stigma and prejudice harmful to health and well-being. Previous research documenting the negative effects of political campaigns on LGBTIQ people’s health and well-being has largely left unexplored the effects on their families and allies. The present study analyzed open-ended responses of the parent allies of LGBTIQ people (N = 232) to questions about the effects of the public debate during the 2017 Australian Marriage Law postal survey. Parents expressed some positive experiences of connection to other supporters of marriage equality. Parents also reported many negative emotions and experiences. The debates increased their awareness of prejudice and discrimination targeting their children and made them fearful for their own and their children’s safety. Parents reported negative impacts on some interpersonal relationships with friends, family members, co-workers, and other community members. They expressed feelings of alienation and anger toward the government, media, and religious institutions for fostering anti-LGBTIQ prejudice and discrimination. Some parents reported feeling discouraged about society or humanity in general because of the public debate.

AB  - The present research aims to deconstruct the proclamatory discourses on COVID-19 circulating in the networks of cyberspaces. The study attempts to analyse whether the knowledge produced about the precautionary assumptions such as a lockdown or social distancing are intentionally highlighted through media and other social networks. For this purpose, the research borrows Jean Baudrillard’s concept of Simulacra and Simulation to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic creates a sensation of unreal fear at the global level. This excessive sensation constructs a culture of exercising power that gradually replaces the real understanding of discrimination between reality and imitation. This projection of sustained discordance aligns with Baudrillard’s basic tenets of media simulation of reality, wherein a simulation process is a fabricated culture constructed by human beings that dominates nature through a reversal of commonsensical understanding about the relationship between nature and the culture that is constructed by man. Hence, whatever knowledge is consumed as a constructed entity remains a copy ad infinitum. The exploration demonstrates the stage of hyper-reality highlighted in the process of simulation and simulacra. The present analysis is interested in perusing the effects of interpenetration between the real/created media knowledge production through Baudrillard’s concept of simulation simulacra. © 2021 Academy of Social Sciences.

AB  - In psychology, prejudice has typically been studied by social psychology (e.g., intergroup processes), but the last 20 years have seen a renewed and growing interest for research on personality traits and prejudice. The present meta-analysis integrates findings between personality traits (Big Five), ideological attitudes (SDO; social dominance orientation and RWA; right-wing authoritarianism-), and cultural attitudes (cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation). Our theoretical framework was the Dual Process Model (DPM; (Duckitt, 2001), which posits that low agreeableness and low openness predict more cultural prejudice through the mediating effects of SDO and RWA. We also developed an extended DPM-2 by adding cultural appreciation as a second outcome. The systematic search for published and unpublished studies identified 300 independent samples. Overall, the main meta-analytical results support both the initial DPM and the extended DPM-2. In the DPM, low agreeableness was linked to cultural prejudice through SDO, whereas low openness was related to cultural prejudice through RWA. In the extended DPM-2, in addition to the same mediated links already present in the DPM, agreeableness was linked to cultural appreciation through low SDO, whereas openness was related (though weakly) to cultural appreciation through low RWA. In addition, the antecedents of cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are mostly the same; they do not necessarily have the same effect sizes. Importantly, the findings support that cultural prejudice and cultural appreciation are partially distinct and negatively interrelated attitudinal constructs. Results are discussed in terms of appreciation and prejudice toward ethnocultural outgroups being two complementary concepts for research. © 2021. Canadian Psychological Association

AB  - In spite of their subtle nature, subliminal cues of group devaluation can have profound effects on members of targeted groups. Across three studies, we examine factors that allow people to counteract subliminal cues of group devaluation. We do this in the context of Spanish–German intergroup relations following the 2008 financial crisis. Throughout the crisis, narratives in politics and the media have drawn on national stereotypes to legitimize the economic situation in Spain. We argue that this represents a threat to our Spanish participants and that exposure to subliminal cues that reflect this threat will trigger responses that counteract this threat. Indeed, results showed that when subliminal associations legitimize the disadvantage faced by the group, our Spanish participants reversed the subliminal associations to which they were exposed. These findings show that Spanish participants are able to counteract the devaluation of their national in-group, even when that devaluation occurs outside of conscious awareness. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - European integration has been progressing even as support for Eurosceptic parties has been rising. Post-functionalist literature focuses on how public attitudes affect the progress of European integration (bottom-up), but the mechanism through which European integration affects domestic politics (top-down) is underexplored. Extreme parties on either the left or right are known to adopt a Polity-Eurosceptic agenda in order to realign the main domestic political cleavage and turn themselves into the new mainstream. We aim to contribute to this literature by arguing that the timing and type of EU events matter. Specifically, the vote for such Eurosceptified Pariah Parties increase with integration events that have a potential for high media profile, signal reduced state autonomy, and occur in proximity to national elections. Furthermore, we argue that even if mainstream parties may counter Eurosceptified Pariah Parties’ claims, the net effect is to ratchet-up electoral support for the latter. We support this argument by employing a mixed-method design using both a natural experiment approach (UESD for Spain’s 1993 election) and a model-based approach (all parties in 1979–2017 and a new event database). Results are robust to the usual confounders, and the exclusion of different classes of events and opportunistically-timed elections. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aim: In response to the SARS-CoV-2 emergency, the Competence Centre on digital health ‘TrentinoSalute4.0’ has developed TreC_Televisita, a tele visit solution that meets the needs of the Trentino healthcare system and maintains high-quality patient–doctor interactions while respecting social distancing. This paper highlights how ‘TreC_Televisita’ was integrated into the Trentino healthcare system and its potential to become a structural and durable solution for the future local healthcare service provisioning. Subject and methods: This paper presents the multifactorial context that TreC_Televisita has faced for its implementation and the strategies adopted for its structural integration into the healthcare system. The analysis focuses on the main issues faced for the integration of the tele visits (e.g. privacy, payments) and how the context of TrentinoSalute4.0 permitted responding quickly to its implementation during the pandemic. It also describes how TreC_Televisita fits into the healthcare continuum from the organisational and technological standpoint, the end-user perspective and the barriers that could hamper the solution scalability. Results: TreC_Televisita has demonstrated to be a technological solution that can be contextualised for different clinical domains beyond SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has shown its potential to scale up the solution beyond the COVID-19 emergency to the whole healthcare provisioning system in the long term. Conclusion: Being a positive experience in the first months of its implementation, the long-term goal is to transform TreC_Televisita into a structural pillar of the Trentino healthcare system, setting the bases for a sustainable, win–win situation for all the stakeholders involved in healthcare service provisioning. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: To determine whether perceived changes (i.e. perception of engagement during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic) in specific health behaviors differ by weight status (i.e. healthy weight, overweight, obese). Design: Cross-sectional. Recruitment took place between June-August 2020, via social media posts and Qualtrics online panels. Setting: Participants completed the survey online through the Qualtrics platform. Sample: Analyses included N = 502 participants (≥18 years); 45.2% healthy weight (n = 227), 28.5% overweight (n = 143), and 26.3% obese (n = 132). Measures: Study-specific survey items included questions about demographics and perceived changes in health behaviors. Analysis: Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed the odds of perceiving changes in health behaviors considered a risk for weight gain. Results: Participants with obesity, but not overweight, were significantly more likely to report deleterious changes to health behaviors compared to healthy weight peers, including: (1) decreased fruit/vegetable consumption [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.13, 3.26)]; (2) increased processed food consumption [AOR = 1.85; 95%CI: (1.15, 3.00)]; (3) increased caloric intake [AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: (1.06, 2.61)]; (4) decreased physical activity [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.31, 3.28)]; and (5) deterioration in sleep quality [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.32, 3.25)]. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that adults with obesity may be at greater risk for unhealthy behaviors during a period of prolonged social distancing, potentially exacerbating the obesity epidemic. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Social workers often address the emotional needs of family caregivers, which are particularly salient during the decision-making process regarding the choice of a living environment for a relative with dementia. In most home care settings, an assessment of caregivers’ needs is not part of routine practices. This study aims to describe the intervention strategies adopted by social workers in relation to caregivers’ emotions during their decision-making process. A qualitative research design was adopted. Seven social workers were recruited from three health and community service facilities in Montreal, Canada. One group and three individual semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was analyzed using Miles, Huberman and Saldaña’s method (2013). Seven intervention strategies were identified: investigating emotions, acknowledging emotions, encouraging caregivers to carry on their role, focusing on the rational aspects of the decision, mitigating prejudices against nursing homes, mediating family dynamics and acting upon families’ needs. Some of these strategies are aimed at social workers meeting the demands of their jobs whilst others are centered around soothing caregiver emotions. These results can inform support services and future interventions by grounding them in the realities of service providers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Despite the importance of cultural difference perceptions in intergroup relations, prior work has paid insufficient attention to the intersection between intergroup contact, perceived cultural distance, and policy support. Using cross-sectional data from a community sample of 210 Turkish citizens, this study examined whether perceived cultural distance would mediate the link between intergroup contact and support for Syrian refugee rights. The results showed that perceived cultural distance mediated the relationship between contact quality, but not contact quantity, and support for refugee rights. This mediated relationship was further moderated by political orientation, such that perceived cultural distance mediated the role of contact quality in support for refugee rights only among participants with a leftist (vs. rightist) orientation. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings were discussed, along with a reflection on future research directions.

AB  - Hate Speech and harassment are widespread in online communication, due to users' freedom and anonymity and the lack of regulation provided by social media platforms. Hate speech is topically focused (misogyny, sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.), and each specific manifestation of hate speech targets different vulnerable groups based on characteristics such as gender (misogyny, sexism), ethnicity, race, religion (xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia), sexual orientation (homophobia), and so on. Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing. Moreover, we prove that domain-independent affective knowledge, injected into our models, helps finer-grained hate speech detection. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The study examines the effects of visual framing in news coverage of law enforcement use of lethal force. In a 2X2 online experiment, participants read one of four versions of a news story that included visual racial cues (images depicting a Black vs. a White victim) and a delinquent/normative frame—depicting the victim wearing attire that signifies either normative or delinquent behavior (regalia vs. a hooded sweatshirt). Both race and delinquency framing influenced the readers’ stereotype endorsement and feelings toward Black Americans. However, judgment of the police officer’s behavior solely depended on the victim’s race. These findings demonstrate the importance of imagery accompanying news reporting on social issues in activating and intensifying White-centered intergroup biases. Implications for responsible journalistic practices are discussed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed at estimating the pre-pandemic and pandemic prevalence of loneliness and investigating the association of loneliness with social disconnectedness during social distancing strategies in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic period. Methods: We used data from the ELSI COVID-19 initiative with participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), which comprised 4,431 participants aged 50 years and over. Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question “In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?”. Social disconnectedness included information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely. Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulating virtual talking connectedness might have the potential to diminish loneliness despite steep outside-home disconnectedness. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this survey was to understand the impact the Covid-19 pandemic has or has had on the work, training, and wellbeing of professionals in the field of diagnostic neuroradiology. Methods: A survey was emailed to all ESNR members and associates as well as distributed via professional social media channels. The survey was held in the summer of 2020 when the first wave had subsided in most of Europe, while the second wave was not yet widespread. The questionnaire featured a total of 46 questions on general demographics, the various phases of the healthcare crisis, and the numbers of Covid-19 patients. Results: One hundred sixty-seven responses were received from 48 countries mostly from neuroradiologists (72%). Most commonly taken measures during the crisis phase were reduction of outpatient exams (87%), reduction of number of staff present in the department (83%), reporting from home (62%), and shift work (54%). In the exit phase, these measures were less frequently applied, but reporting from home was still frequent (33%). However, only 22% had access to a fully equipped work station at home. While 81% felt safe at work during the crisis, fewer than 50% had sufficient personal protection equipment for the duration of the entire crisis. Mental wellbeing is an area of concern, with 61% feeling (much) worse than usual. Many followed online courses/congresses and considered these a viable alternative for the future. Conclusion: The Covid-19 pandemic substantially affected the professional life as well as personal wellbeing of neuroradiologists. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article develops the concept of “mimetic weaponization” for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from “sharing a joke” to promoting “alternative facts,” rebuking “political correctness” or “wokeness,” defending preferred framings of “free speech,” or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with “mainstream” media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme’s public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize–ostensibly through humour, parody or satire–rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as “just a bit of fun.”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Rationale: The gap between the nutrition education provided to medical students and the nutrition competences and attitudes needed for doctors to provide effective nutrition care is a global concern. The goal of this study was to investigate the curricular content on nutrition education in Latin American medical schools and to evaluate the self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to nutrition practice of final-year medical students. Methods: Eighty-five public and private medical schools from 17 Latin American countries were invited to participate in the study. Two close-ended online questionnaires consisting of 25 and 43 questions were sent to medical school directors. Quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, percentages, mean ± standard deviation, medians, and ranges. Results: A total of 22 (26%) medical school directors responded, of which 11 schools (50%) offered stand-alone mandatory nutrition courses in preclinical and 8 (36%) in clinical years. The mean hours dedicated to nutrition education was 47 (range: 0–150). A total of 1530 of 1630 (94%) students from 12 countries responded. Students’ average age was 25 ± 3 years, and 59% were female. Most students agreed that improving patients’ health through nutrition (91%) is important and that nutrition counseling and assessment should be part of routine care provided by all physicians (89%), but they lack the level of education and training required to address nutrition-related issues. Conclusions: Positive attitude and interest in nutrition among final-year medical students is high, but nutrition education is not perceived as sufficient to adequately prepare doctors in the field of nutrition. © 2021 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition

AB  - Introduction: Internalized sexual stigma, adult attachment, relationship satisfaction, and emotion regulation pay a major role in predicting depression in minority populations. Method: We examined the variables in a sample of 165 gay (64.8%) and bisexual men (35.2%), ages 19-68 years (M = 36.2; SD = 11.6). Results: Internalized stigma, attachment insecurity, relationship satisfaction, and emotion dysregulation predicted depression; emotion regulation mediated the relationship between internalized stigma and depression, between attachment and depression, as well as between relationship satisfaction and depression. Conclusion: Findings suggest the importance of improving educational community programs on sexual prejudices and on social homo and bi-negativity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) prepares health students to become collaboration-ready healthcare professionals. Assessing students’ baseline attitudes toward IPE and collaborative practice is essential to inform development of IPE curricula. Kuwait University Health Sciences Center (HSC) is early in its IPE journey but is planning to join the broader global movement toward IPE. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the attitudes of HSC students from Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Allied Health Sciences toward collaborative practice and IPE at early and late stages of study. A total of 770 students completed the survey (81.1% response rate). Students expressed positive attitudes toward interprofessional healthcare teams and IPE (median [IQR] overall attitudes were rated 4.0 [1.0] and 4.0 [2.0], respectively, on a scale of 5). Overall attitudes toward both scales were significantly more positive among pharmacy students than students from other faculties (p < .001). Final-year students reported more positive attitudes toward healthcare teams than early- and middle-year students, while early- and final-year students expressed more positive attitudes toward IPE than middle-year students (p < .001). There were no significant differences in overall attitudes between female and male students toward the two scales (p > .05). These findings have implications for engaging students from different professions in IPE initiatives. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 within the United States have been compromised by varying levels of engagement in preventive behaviors, such as mask wearing, social distancing and vaccine uptake. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - How does local television news shape viewers’ national political attitudes? The answer is unclear, because local news typically focuses on local, not national, stories, and is politically neutral. But the rise of Sinclair Broadcasting, now the nation’s second-largest owner of local TV stations, upends that assumption. News on Sinclair-owned stations focuses more on national topics, and presents them with a right-wing slant. Given this, we might expect it to shift its viewers’ attitudes in a pro-Republican direction. Using data on Sinclair’s acquisition of local TV stations between 2008 and 2018, I show that living in an area with a Sinclair-owned TV station lowers viewers’ approval of President Obama during his tenure in office, and makes viewers less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee for president. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of local TV news, as well as for media trust, as I discuss in the conclusion. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This research examined the impact of sexual orientation on heterosexuals’ judgment of parental competence. Using a vignette approach, Study 1 presented participants with a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couple who desired to have a child, either as adoptive parents or, in an additional heterosexual target condition, as biological parents. Study 2 presented a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual parent couple; heterosexual targets were either adoptive parents, reflecting the LG target conditions, or biological parents. Contradicting Hypothesis 1, neither target sexual orientation nor way to parenthood (with the latter varied in the heterosexual target condition only) had an impact on parental competence attributions. Confirming Hypothesis 2, participants with personal contact with lesbian and gay (LG) people provided higher ratings of LG target parental competence, mediated by positive attitudes toward homosexuality. Importantly, this mediation did not occur in the heterosexual target condition, corroborating the specificity of the intergroup contact effect. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Existential nihilism is on the rise in modern societies, but no previous work has investigated the social psychology of seeing no meaning in life. In the current research, five studies (N = 1,634) show that targets’ existential nihilist beliefs elicit a range of negative stereotypes about personality traits, commonly valued social traits, and targets’ ability to perform basic adaptive social tasks. Results demonstrate that these negative stereotypes are mediated by belief that the target is depressed more than the belief the target is non-religious or that the target does not plan for the future. Unlike atheists, who are seen as competent, no positive stereotypes emerged for nihilists, suggesting both future research and interventions aimed at updating false beliefs about nihilists. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Transgender individuals face many barriers to healthcare access, including providers’ lack of knowledge on transgender-specific healthcare needs. Physicians and medical students report a lack of training on and low confidence with transgender-related healthcare. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of self-efficacy and beliefs regarding affirmative practice for counsellors’ engagement in affirmative practice with LGBTQ+ clients. The present study investigated healthcare professional students’ attitudes towards transgender individuals, as well as the influence of students’ skills in working with transgender clients and their confidence understanding transgender healthcare terms on their beliefs about, self-efficacy regarding, and actual engagement in affirmative practice. Sixty-one Canadian healthcare professional students participated in an online survey. Participants reported positive attitudes towards transgender individuals, and positive beliefs about the importance of affirmative practice with LGBTQ+ clients. In a multiple mediation model, confidence with understanding transgender healthcare terms and practical skills with working with transgender clients each related to self-efficacy regarding affirmative practice; self-efficacy in turn related to engagement in affirmative practice. Healthcare professional students’ positive attitudes and beliefs are promising; additional training that builds practical skills and confidence in using correct language is important for students’ self-efficacy and engagement in affirmative practice. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - I offer a new measure of perceived proprietary right (PPR) to resources as an operationalization of one critical aspect of Harold Blumer’s group threat theory. Black (n = 82), Asian (n = 72), and White (n = 176) participants completed PPR items in the context of a residential resource allocation task designed to evoke competitive threat. A four-factor model of PPR was established through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. For Black participants, competitive threat was directly related to anti-Asian prejudice. For Asian participants, competitive threat was related to anti-Black prejudice indirectly, through belief in merit as a source of PPR. Moderated parallel mediation models also uncovered PPR beliefs–on the basis of past oppression and outsider status–as possible sources of allyship between Black and Asian community members. Findings are discussed in relation to Black and Asian relations specifically and the contribution of PPR to intergroup relations more generally. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose an unprecedented challenge for the world as people strive to cope with this significant threat to their well-being. This intensive longitudinal study of the first 94 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea (Phase 1: initial outbreak, Phase 2: intense social distancing) examined individuals’ changes in well-being, in relation to their use of coping strategies and fear of infection. A sample of 10,464 South Koreans participated in surveys during Phase 1 and Phase 2, resulting in 35,846 observations. Multilevel growth models revealed a decrease in well-being while different coping strategies moderated the individual rate of change in well-being. Although preventive measures were associated with a greater decrease in well-being, cognitive appraisal and behavioral strategies predicted stable well-being during the pandemic. Coping strategies further mediated the association between fear of infection and deterioration of well-being. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - As in other areas of healthcare, the quality of patient care in the field of sport science and sports medicine (SSSM) could benefit from interprofessional collaboration between the professions involved. As a prerequisite, healthcare providers in the SSSM field should be equipped with positive attitudes and perceptions toward interprofessional collaboration (IPC) and interprofessional education (IPE), however detailed investigations are lacking. This study aimed to collect and compare socio-demographic data as well as interprofessional attitudes of SSSM professionals from an international perspective. Subjects were invited via professional SSSM organizations, personal networks and social media to participate in a cross-sectional online survey. Three-hundred and twenty complete datasets of SSSM professionals from the regions USA (n = 83), Canada (n = 179) and Europe (n = 58) were evaluated. In this survey, socio-demographic data as well as attitudes toward IPC and IPE using the 4 subscales of the University of West of England interprofessional Questionnaire (UWE-IP) were collected and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. In the socio-demographic data, there was a diversity of participants representing different regional healthcare, sports and educational framing conditions. On average, in all regions clear positive attitudes were shown in the UWE-IP subscales communication & teamwork, interprofessional learning and interprofessional relationship, whereas in the subscale interprofessional interaction negative perceptions were observed on average across all regions. Significant effects of participants’ demographic variables region, age and gender on some of the subscales were detected. Practitioners in the SSSM field have a high willingness and a beneficial preparedness for IPC and IPE, however, the framing conditions and the systems the respondents surveyed are working in do not support IPC. Interprofessional settings in learning and in workplace (e.g., theme-centred workshops, patient-centred case studies, health promotion activities) may help to improve interprofessional interactions in SSSM. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Far-right actors are often purveyors of Islamophobic hate speech online, using social media to spread divisive and prejudiced messages which can stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Hateful content can inflict harm on targeted victims, create a sense of fear amongst communities and stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to better understand at a granular level how Islamophobia manifests online and who produces it. We investigate the dynamics of Islamophobia amongst followers of a prominent UK far right political party on Twitter, the British National Party. Analysing a new data set of five million tweets, collected over a period of one year, using a machine learning classifier and latent Markov modelling, we identify seven types of Islamophobic far right actors, capturing qualitative, quantitative and temporal differences in their behaviour. Notably, we show that a small number of users are responsible for most of the Islamophobia that we observe. We then discuss the policy implications of this typology in the context of social media regulation. © 2021 Department of Security Studies and Criminology.

AB  - Two experimental studies were carried out to investigate the effect of company size and cause proximity on consumer response to CSR initiatives. Findings from Study 1 demonstrated that, for a large company, the national cause led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially responsible corporate image than the local cause. By comparison, for a small company, the local cause produced more positive attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially conscious corporate image than the national cause. Further delving into the cognitive mechanism of this fit effect, Study 2 investigated the mediating role of message credibility and explored how the mediation varied with consumers’ level of cause involvement. A series of moderated mediation analyses showed that when company size and cause proximity were congruent, participants displayed higher message credibility, which led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company and a better corporate image than in an incongruent condition. This research suggests that company size does matter in consumer response to CSR engagement and offers initial explanations for it. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided. © 2020 Advertising Association.

AB  - Criminalization of social groups can create new norms for intergroup relations. An example for this is the 2018 amendment to the Hungarian Fundamental Law, which openly criminalizes homeless people. In our research, we investigated whether criminalization of homelessness can become a source of justifying violence against homeless people in the Hungarian context. We assumed that right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation would positively predict support for violence against the homeless, and the acceptance of a criminalizing law can serve as a justification for this. Our hypotheses were tested using a convenience (N = 196) and a representative sample of the population of Budapest (N = 674). We found that both RWA and SDO predicted support for violence, and this connection was mediated by the new law. We also found that justification was influenced by educational level, as the association between SDO and violence increased with higher levels of education. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Despite the fact that social distancing is an effective mean to slow the spread of COVID-19, individuals often fail to practice this behavior. Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention’s impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle. Overall, the study found news media to have an important role in promoting social-distancing behavior when they emphasized safety measures across the ideological spectrum. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Prejudice towards trans women is an under-examined but a critical social problem in Turkey. Patriarchal femininity sanctions women who do not comply with the idealised female bodies and feminine norms. On the other hand, ideals of hegemonic masculinity necessitate that men avoid femininity. In that sense, prejudice against trans women ostensibly stands at the intersection of hegemonic masculinity ideology and femininities that diverge from patriarchal feminine norms. Therefore, this study examines the mediatory effect of femmephobia in the link between masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women as measured by negative affect and social distancing motivations. Results indicate that femmephobia significantly mediates the relationship between the endorsement of masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women. Among three mandates of masculinity ideology, the endorsement of the antifemininity mandate was the most solid indirect predictor of negative affect and social distance through femmephobia, followed by mandates of toughness and status, respectively. Although participant gender does not have an indirect effect on the outcome variables, it has a direct effect on men’s social distancing intentions but not on negative emotions. The results are discussed in the light of existing literature which intersects with the devaluation of femininity. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined the predictive role of attention deficit disorders (ADHD) on the experience of loneliness among college students during the move to distance learning and social distancing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study examined a serial multiple mediation of students’ experiences with distance learning, perceived social support, and hope. We hypothesised that students with ADHD would experience social distress in addition to struggling with distance learning. However, we expect that social support and hope may mediate their loneliness. The sample consisted of 648 students (Mean age 27.99, SD–7.08), in a medium size college in the centre of Israel. Participants were divided into two groups: 529 typical students and 119 students with ADHD. Loneliness, negative experiences during the use of distance learning, perceptions of social support, and hope were examined. Students with ADHD reported higher levels of loneliness and more negative experiences with distance learning than their peers. Results demonstrated that ADHD and negative experiences with distance learning predicted higher levels of loneliness, while college support and peer support in addition to hopeful thinking mediated these relations. The discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of loneliness and support while emphasising the therapeutic implications of hope. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Evidence on the association between internet usage and incidence of depression remains mixed. We examined the associations between different categories of internet usage and developing clinical depression. We used data from the 2013 and 2016 waves of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) comprising 12,333 physically and cognitively independent adults aged ≥65 years. Participants were engaged in seven categories of internet usage: communication with friends/family, social media, information collection about health/medicine, searching for medical facilities, purchase of drugs and vitamins, shopping, and banking. We found that internet use for communication had a protective influence on the probability of developing clinical depression defined as the Geriatric Depression Scale scores ≥5 or self-reported diagnosed depression. Our findings support the role of online communication with friends/family in preventing clinical depression among older people. Online communication could be particularly useful in the COVID-19 crisis because many families are geographically dispersed and/or socially distanced. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In this article, I explore the intersection between Hans Georg Gadamer’s ‘fusion of horizons’ and interpreter’s ‘prejudices,’ together with the concept of cultural resonances as they pertain to qualitative research in psychology. I define cultural resonances as the researcher’s different cultural associations and/or connotations (e.g., myths, legends, popular media references), that emerge in an interpretive encounter with a text. Through a reading of Gadamer’s theory, I further explain how cultural resonances are contained within what he referred to as the interpreter’s language, prejudice, horizon, and play. Therefore, inspired by Gadamer’s assertion that understanding is always a process in which different worlds of knowledge (horizons) fuse together, and with reference to psychoanalytic reverie, Boesch’s concepts of cultural psychology, and narrative theory, I discuss cultural resonances as a horizon that inevitably unfolds in qualitative research. Finally, relying on the different topics discussed in the article, I offer a Gadamer-inspired framework for using cultural resonances in qualitative interpretation. The limitations of this framework, as well as its advantages, are discussed, with regard to reflexivity, power, rigor, and cultural sensitivity. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Global attitude certainty consists of two subconstructs: attitude clarity—certainty that one is aware of one’s true attitudes—and attitude correctness, certainty that one’s attitudes are morally correct and valid. Attitude correctness is more often associated with group-related psychological and behavioral outcomes than attitude clarity. As such, we expected that attitude correctness, but not attitude clarity, would be associated with more negative attitudes toward outgroups when group boundaries are defined by attitudes. Across four studies, greater attitude correctness related to more negative attitudes toward attitudinal outgroups regardless of context (e.g., political, religious); attitude clarity’s relationship to prejudice was inconsistent (Studies 1a and 2: positive or no relationship; Study 3: negative; Studies 1b and 4: no relationship). In Studies 2 and 3, mediational analyses showed that greater attitude correctness was associated with stronger beliefs that group boundaries are sharp and distinct (i.e., discreteness beliefs), which in turn was associated with greater prejudice. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that the attitude correctness–prejudice link was associated with greater intention to engage in competitive behaviors in a conflict resolution scenario with an outgroup member. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - In light of the global crisis created by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019, the goal of the study was to detect factors that might enhance people's ability to experience positive psychological change during traumatic events. As such, this study examined the relationship between social participation and posttraumatic growth (PTG) during the coronavirus outbreak and tested the mediating role of hope, social support, and cognitive reappraisal in explaining this relationship. The sample consisted of 275 participants (21.8% male, and 78.2% female, with an average age of 33.42, SD = 13.63), subjected to social-distancing regulations during this period. Results demonstrated a serial mediation model in which social participation predicted PTG directly and indirectly through hope (pathways and agency), social support, and cognitive reappraisal. The importance of social participation in nourishing personal resources and practical implications including the need for prevention programs are discussed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - The objective behind the present article is two-fold. Firstly, departing from the assumption that distance and salience dynamics are key to both functioning and impact of the media, we aim to present a new theoretical perspective on social media discourse understood as both product and process–Media Proximization Approach–and thus shed light on the exploratory potential of Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS) paradigm (KhosraviNik, 2017b. Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS). In J. Flowerdew, & J. E. Richardson (Eds.), Handbook of Critical Discourse Analysis (pp. 583–596). Routledge) emphasizing both the horizontal (industrial) and vertical (social) dimensions of digital communication. Secondly, identifying various dimensions of proximization within social media, we will discuss their role in creating a conducive environment for the spread of populist ideologies, and, more generally, changing the communication dynamics between the primary and secondary definers. Data-wise, the article focuses on current social media discursive practices concerning Enoch Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in the context of rising anti-immigration sentiment and Brexit campaign. Two YouTube videos recontextualizing the speech along with the accompanying comments will be discussed here to show how political discourses get remediated in social media where their ‘prosumers’ imbue them with new form, function and emotionality. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. Methods: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words ‘loneliness’ and ‘COVID-19’. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. Results: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. Conclusions: The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues. It also provides inspiration for potential interventions to address novel problems–such as loneliness–during COVID-19 pandemic. © 2020

AB  - The 2012 gangrape of a young woman in Delhi, known as the Nirbhaya case, became an international media event that cast public spaces in India as unsafe, and situated sexual violence as a problem characterized by class difference and lack of development. This dominant media discourse reiterated long-standing neocolonial, classist and casteist tropes that signified a failure of transnational solidarity. At this time, Talk to Me, a public art intervention by the Bangalore-based feminist artist collective, Blank Noise, went viral on social media. The project took place near the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology on a lane along which many women experience molestation and harassment. Students from Srishti engaged strangers–typically migrant and displaced men from the lower classes–in a conversation over tea and a snack. In this article, I analyse Talk to Me as an intervention that offered a counternarrative and countervisual to the dominant, fear-based characterization of public spaces in India. Talk to Me encouraged participants, through a process of dialogue and conversation, to identify and overcome their internalized biases about the lower-class, migrant men who are often constructed as sexual threats to upper-class women. These conversations, I argue, were designed to break down ingrained biases and internalized prejudice, and to attempt to create compassion and solidarity across the barriers of class, education, language, and gender. The intervention offers a model of building solidarity that is not passive or automatic, but rather requires the difficult and often uncomfortable labour of self-reflection and introspection. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article examines how artists have engaged with the issue of air pollution in Beijing, where poor air quality has become a serious public health matter. Artists have utilized various mediums including performance art, photography, and painting to represent smog. Through generating media and online attention this work has contributed to a relatively vibrant “green public sphere” (Yang and Calhoun, 2007) of air pollution discourse. In contrast to much resistance in China that relies upon making specific claims to government officials, artistic expression bypasses the authorities and appeals instead to public opinion. Artists utilize ambiguity to portray air pollution in novel ways that subtly question the structures that produce and sustain it. In this way, artists can challenge popular perceptions of smog and raise public awareness, thus intensifying support for policies that tackle smog. Yet art can also embody deep frustration at the powerlessness that artists, and the public more widely, experience when confronted by severe air pollution. Art therefore serves both as a form of activism and as an expression of curtailed agency in a politically restrictive environment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study explored associations between disordered eating, barriers, and attitudes towards help-seeking. A total of 198 young women completed online questionnaires assessing eating pathology, attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help, and barriers to seeking help. Higher levels of self-reported eating pathology were associated with more positive attitudes toward seeking professional help and with greater perceptions of barriers to help-seeking. An inconsistent mediation model (with suppression effect) indicated young women with higher eating pathology perceived more barriers to seeking help, which were associated with less positive attitudes towards seeking help for psychological issues; however, when barriers were held constant, eating pathology was associated with more positive attitudes towards seeking help. Results from this study highlight the need to identify and reduce barriers that impede mental health service utilization among young women with disordered eating. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Three experiments tested whether verification of ingroup morality increases engagement in collective action in favor of immigrants’ rights. To that end, participants were exposed to (a) verifying, (b) negatively discrepant, (c) enhancing, or (d) no feedback about the morality of their group in general (Studies 1–2) or specifically in matters of corruption (Study 3). Results show that those who received verifying feedback of their group’s morality were more willing to engage in collective action than those who received negative or no feedback. These effects seemed to be mediated by increased anger over immigrants’ disadvantage and positive attitudes towards them. Critically, enhancing feedback exerted similar effects as verifying feedback, although the latter yielded more stable and consistent results across the studies. These results suggest that appeals to collective ingroup morality can be effective to promote immigrants’ rights, especially when members of the host society feel that others consider them as moral as they perceive themselves. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Donald Trump frequently attacks foreign countries such as Germany (e.g., via Twitter). Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump’s utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N = 428) revealed that Trump’s anti-German utterances increased EU’s popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU’s popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump’s anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States. Implications for journalistic news coverage are discussed. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study analyzes media coverage of Census Bureau projections showing that the U.S. will become a majority-minority state by mid-century. I argue that the mismatch between the racial/ethnic categories used by the media in their coverage of Census projections, and the official government categories used by the Census, help construct social boundaries around “whiteness” that allows for growth of minority populations to be presented as a challenge for “American” society. I contend that media portrayals of Census projections can influence public perceptions of the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S., thus impacting political attitudes and voting behavior among the U.S. populace. © 2020 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - While financial regulation became highly contested in the aftermath of the financial crisis, the specifics of such regulation is usually debated among professionals, in specialized fora. This article analyses an exception to this; the debate on the loan-to-value ratio regulation introduced in Norway in 2010. Newspaper articles are analysed, using Boltanski & Thevenot’s pragmatic perspective on how actors legitimize their arguments and critique. Unlike other critical approaches (i.e., critical discourse analysis) this perspective focuses on actors own critical capacity and it is argued that the approach is useful in analyzing re-politicizing efforts of social actors. The main finding is that most arguments opposing the regulation are based in the civic “regime of justification”, while arguments supporting the regulation are based in the industrial regime of justification. Few arguments enact the market regime as justification. The article discusses reasons why the regulation has not been repelled, despite the widespread criticism. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Social networks are becoming a site of unprecedented diffusion of fake news and misinformation in Morocco. This fact does not only affect people as individuals but also undermines social order and cohesion in general. To fight back, a number of journalists and researchers have engaged in fact-checking processes to verify claims and information. In this regard, this study considers fact-checking as an emerging journalistic brand that has the potential to promote healthier public debate in the contemporary media environment in Morocco. For this reason, a qualitative approach is adopted to explore the nature of a group of Moroccan online fact checkers to understand their motivations, practices, process of production, and the impact they have made in the public sphere. The significance of this research resides in the fact that it tracks a trend in Moroccan media landscape and investigates its importance in creating communities of interest. Also, exploring this new online trend will help in providing a different perspective on the richness and diversity of content, and change how people think about the online media environment in Morocco. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The mediating role of emotional reactions and their relevance for political attitudes and behavioral intentions has remained an understudied subject, and the extant literature has mostly overlooked the importance of political campaigning on social media in the context of the European Union (EU). Using an experimental design, we test whether political parties’ (1) positive or negative EU-related (2) emotional or non-emotional political messages influence citizens’ emotions toward the EU, whether these emotions affect politically relevant outcomes, and whether the effects differ for citizens with varying political ideologies. We find that positive emotions in particular affect almost all outcome variables above and beyond experimental condition and individuals’ political orientation. We discuss our results in light of political marketing research and recent developments in the EU. © 2019 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study examined core belief violation and meaning making as mechanisms mediating the relationship between adherence to social isolation policies for mitigating coronavirus transmission and reduced coronavirus anxiety (CA). Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents’ meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Research question: In this study we examine whether knowledge management (KM), along with innovation concepts (attitude toward innovation, open innovation, and innovativeness), evokes direct and indirect influences on organizational performance of nonprofit sports clubs. Research methods: A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected online from board members of nonprofit sports clubs in Iran. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationships between variables. Results and findings: The results indicate that KM has a positive effect on organizational performance via two different sequential mediators: attitude toward innovation and innovativeness, and open innovation and innovativeness. KM has a direct positive effect on sport clubs’ innovativeness and organizational performance. Implications: Nonprofit sports clubs should take advantage of promoting KM processes such as facilitating the development and sharing of new knowledge through relying on internal and external knowledge sources. By doing so, sports clubs can enhance capabilities to exploit external knowledge and foster a positive attitude towards newness and innovation which can help them to innovate more and perform better. The study provides theoretical and managerial implications that help sports clubs innovate and increase multiple aspects of their organizational performance. © 2020 European Association for Sport Management.

We address this question by focusing on the ‘PEGIDA’ (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) protest groups in Germany, which became particularly prominent by attracting large numbers of attendees in street protests during the years 2015/16. We develop and test an integrative theoretical model that points to the key roles of anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction as mediators linking subjective socioeconomic deprivation with citizens’ support of the ‘Pegida’-movement. Equally important, this model holds that citizens’ political dissatisfaction moderates the nexus between anti-immigrant attitudes and support for ‘Pegida’. The results based on data from seven cross-sectional general population surveys provide clear support for these predictions. Combined, these efforts help to advance scholarly understanding of not only why, but also how and under what conditions non-activist citizens support anti-immigrant collective action as exemplified by the ‘Pegida’ movement. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Fictional narratives can serve as an indirect contact strategy when direct contact between two groups is not feasible. This study investigated whether exposing cisgender individuals to transgender-related fiction was associated with reduced transnegativity. Two emotion-related mediators were examined in this relationship: transportation into the story (proximal to fiction exposure) and intergroup anxiety (proximal to contact theory). Cisgender participants (N = 84) viewed or read stories involving transgender characters or read a science article. Those who encountered transgender characters reported lower transnegativity than those who read the control story. Transportation into the story and intergroup anxiety serially mediated this relationship. The findings suggest conditions under which a fictional story can expand an audience’s social world and thereby serve as a strategy for prejudice reduction. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Since 9/11, representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in Western mass media have received much scholarly attention, not least because such representations influence how Muslims are perceived by and integrated into Western societies. Most existing studies have shown that Muslims and Islam tend to be framed negatively through orientalist and Islamophobic discourses. However, this paper argues that in specific contexts, neoliberal ideology has generated mass-media representations of Muslims and the Islamic world that differ from orientalist versions. In contexts relating to the globalised halal market, for example, neoliberal discourses portray Muslims and the Islamic world as economically useful and/or exploitable rather than culturally threatening. This argument is supported by an analysis of representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in local and regional newspapers in Brazil, one of the largest halal meat and poultry exporters in the world. Drawing on theories of neoliberalism, a discourse theoretical approach and the notion of imaginative geographies, the study examines newspaper articles on the halal business. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that scholars should subject neoliberal ideology (and its interaction with orientalism and Islamophobia) to greater scrutiny in future research on representations of Muslims and the Islamic world. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aim: There are limited studies conducted to explore the social attitudes towards PWDs in Jordan. The aim of this study was to compare public attitudes towards physical, visual, auditory, and intellectual disabilities in the five components of community-based rehabilitation (CBR) which are, education, health, livelihood, social, and empowerment. Another aim of this study was to explore the effects that the factors of gender, age, educational level and geographical area have on the attitudes towards disability. Methods: 499 participants (210 males and 289 females), mean age (42.7 ± 8.4 yrs), age range (18–65 yrs) completed a survey specifically developed for this study based on the CBR guidelines. Results: A value (0.881) of Cronbach’s alpha confirmed the reliability of the survey. About 64% of the sample had positive perception and attitude towards disability. Participants had more positive attitudes towards physical disabilities followed by auditory, visual, and lastly, intellectual disabilities. The lower scores were in the empowerment and then the social components of CBR. Geographical area was the only factor that affected the attitudes towards disability. Conclusion: Positive attitude towards PWDs that is mainly attributed to cultural components associated with religion and some prevalent traditions in certain geographical areas in Jordan. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between religious orientation and death attitudes in Christian U.S. students and Muslim Turkish students. It also assessed whether meaning in life mediated these relationships. Multivariate statistics and path analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of death attitudes in these groups. Intrinsic religiosity was more consistently associated with positive attitudes toward death than extrinsic religiosity, and these patterns remained consistent across groups. Meaning in life mediated some of these relationships, although not consistently. Evidence suggesting differential relationships between religiosity and death attitudes across groups was found, although the overall results suggest more similarities than differences. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this study is to demonstrate effectiveness of mobile game called SOS Table in the context of the subject “Tenses in English” within the framework of mobile learning tools acceptance, learning language motivation and mobile learning attitude of the students. The target group of the research consists of preparatory class students of a school of foreign languages in a state university in Turkey. The research was carried out with mixed method research. The quantitative paradigm-based section of this study was designed with a single-group pre-test and post-test model. In this model, three different scales were applied to the participants. The participants used the SOS Table mobile game developed by the researchers for 8 weeks. After the applications, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed with paired sampled t-Test and the qualitative data were subjected to thematic content analysis. The results of the study indicated that the mobile application named SOS Table increased both the mobile learning tools acceptance of the participants and motivation in English, and mediated the positive attitude development for mobile learning in English. The qualitative data obtained also supported these findings. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - When a mass casualty event occurs, why do some people label it terrorism while others do not? People are more likely to consider an attack to be terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim, yet it is unclear what other factors influence perceptions of mass violence. Using data collected from a national sample of U.S. adults shortly after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, we examine how media consumption and social identity influence views of the attack. Media consumption and individual-level factors—Islamophobia, political ideology, and other participant demographics—influence how people view the attack and how confident people are in their assessments. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
