T1  - Who is allowed to stay? Settlement deservingness preferences towards migrants in four European countries
AN  - 2476846063
AB  - Following the refugee crisis, European countries have tried to stimulate the integration of migrants into local society. However, the public, influenced by negative framing of migrants by media and political actors, may feel that not all migrants are equally deserving of settlement. In this study, we obtain greater insight into the public’s attitudes towards migrants by applying the deservingness framework to migrant settlement in four European countries: Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden, using the CARIN typology (control, attitude, reciprocity, identity, need). We use data from the European Social Survey Round 1 (2002) and Round 7 (2014), and online survey data from 2017. We can draw four main conclusions: 1) (at least) three out of five CARIN-criteria (attitude, reciprocity, and identity) apply to settlement deservingness, 2) the identity criterion is considered the ‘least’ important criterion, while attitude is considered most important, but 3) identity has become increasingly important over time, and 4) there is significant variation in deservingness preferences between countries and over time. Findings indicate that older respondents, men, and Christians are more restrictive towards accepting migrants than younger respondents, women, and Muslims. The role of education is twofold: lower educated individuals value identity more, highly educated individuals value attitude and (future) reciprocity.

T1  - Predictors of Viewing Online Extremism Among America’s Youth
AN  - 2405145670
AB  - Exposure to hate material is related to a host of negative outcomes. Young people might be especially vulnerable to the deleterious effects of such exposure. With that in mind, this article examines factors associated with the frequency that youth and young adults, ages 15 to 24, see material online that expresses negative views toward a social group. We use an online survey of individuals recruited from a demographically balanced sample of Americans for this project. Our analysis controls for variables that approximate online routines, social, political, and economic grievances, and sociodemographic traits. Findings show that spending more time online, using particular social media sites, interacting with close friends online, and espousing political views online all correlate with increased exposure to online hate. Harboring political grievances is likewise associated with seeing hate material online frequently. Finally, Whites are more likely than other race/ethnic groups to be exposed to online hate frequently.

T1  - Is Canadian carbon pricing here to stay? The outlook after 14 elections
AN  - 2357240728
AB  - When Justin Trudeau met Canada's premiers to negotiate a national carbon price in 2016, there had arguably never been a better time to do so. With Liberal governments in most provinces, negotiations concluded quite quickly, with pledges from 11 of the 13 premiers to implement a carbon price as part of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Climate Change (PCF). On the face of it, implementing these prices should have been straightforward: the carbon price (starting at $20/tonne in 2018, and rising to $50/tonne in 2022) was decidedly modest, and unlikely to have any significant macroeconomic impact: pulling $7 billion per year out of a 1.8 trillion-dollar economy is tantamount to a rounding error, and the plan involved provided rebates that would actually improve the economic standing of more than 70% of Canadian households. The reality, however, was the Canada's carbon price was destined to be extremely fragile, as these 11 pro-climate governments would be forced to defend this new 'tax' in their subsequent elections. Indeed, while Canadians were unlikely to feel any negative effects of the carbon price directly, they would undoubtedly learn about it in the scariest possible terms from conservative politicians and right-wing media outlets, who indicated early on their intention to take advantage of the public's poor grasp of carbon pricing to undermine the policy and gain electoral advantage. This was precisely the tactic employed so skilfully in the 2008 federal election, when Stephen Harper's Conservative government engaged in a relentless scare campaign around carbon taxes to discredit his opposition. It was also deftly employed by Tony Abbott in the 2013 federal election in Australia - arguably the polity most analogous to Canada's - after which he managed to fully overturn the country's existing carbon price. Indeed, for many observers, the true durability of Canadian carbon pricing was always going to be determined by the battle for public opinion that would ensue in the years following the signing of the PCF. How, then, had this battle played out? To what extent were conservative forces across Canada able to capitalize successfully on anti-carbon tax...

T1  - Female Video Game Players and the Protective Effect of Feminist Identity Against Internalized Misogyny
AN  - 2234287504
AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one’s own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women’s gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

T1  - Digital Controversy of Iran and the US (case Study: Mohamad Javad Zarif and Mike Pompeo)
AN  - 2628327457
AB  - Twitter is among the most effective microblogging in digital foreign policy and diplomacy. Most world politicians have active presence in in this micro blogging in order to disseminate their information, interact with their audience, and illustrate themselves or others for the purpose of public diplomacy. Mohamad Javad Zarif and Mike Pompeo are among politicians who illustrate themselves and the other through twiplomacy, seeking world positive public opinion towards their respective Governments. Therefore, the writers of this paper have used MAXQDA and three-step coding to answer this question: what image are these two politicians illustrating of themselves and of the other on Twitter, and for what purpose? The results of the content analysis of Zarif indicate an illustration of a law-abiding and peaceful country for Iran and an illustration of a bully and economic-terrorist for the United States. Notwithstanding that Pompeo illustrated a peaceful America, seeking the containment of Iran, and also illustrating Iran as the supporter of terrorism, authoritarian, militarist, and anarchist. This is a quantitative-qualitative research conducted through content analysis and the writers are seeking to assess the presentations of these two politicians from their own Government policies on Twitter by illustration theory.

TT  - La eficacia de una intervención con aplicación móvil sobre actitudes asociadas a la violencia de pareja en los adolescentes de centros de acogida
AN  - 2478114838
AB  - This study focuses on the effectiveness of an app-based, monitored intervention using the Liad@s app in a residential youth-care setting. The aim of this intervention is to reduce maladaptive beliefs and attitudes linked to dating violence: distortions or myths about romantic love and hostile and benevolent dimensions of sexism. A quasi-experimental pre-post study with a control group was carried out. Participants were 71 adolescents from 9 group homes in Valencia (Spain). The outcomes measures were hostile and benevolent sexism (Ambivalent Sexism Inventory - ASI), ambivalence and prejudice towards men (Ambivalence toward Men Inventory - AMI), and myths about romantic love. The results of the intervention were assessed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). A post-intervention, statistically significant reduction with a medium-large effect size was observed in all dimensions for the treatment group, with eta-square of .25 for the sexism dimensions, .38 for myths, and .21 for ambivalence and prejudices. The experimental group demonstrated significantly more change than the control group on all measures. The benefits of the intervention did not vary by participants’ sex. These results may be helpful to professionals involved in child and youth care, who can profit from adolescents’ proclivity toward online communication.Alternate abstract:

T1  - The Mexican European diaspora: class, race and distinctions on social networking sites
AN  - 2311910643
AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora's use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu's theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants' references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by 'the wealthy' [Ruiz, 2008. "Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy." Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/02/social-networks-vip-tech-personal-cx_nr_0502style.html]. We analyse the term 'naco', a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

T1  - Caught between sympathy and suspicion: journalistic perceptions and practices of telling asylum seekers’ personal stories
AN  - 2296048924
AB  - Personal stories in news reports serve multiple purposes, but at their core lie efforts at illustrating and authenticating a social or political issue through human experience, an illustration that is compelling in its affective appeal. Telling the personal stories of people belonging to minority groups may work as a potent journalistic vehicle in countering negative stereotypes and prejudices against them. This article examines how Finnish journalists incorporate the personal stories of asylum seekers into their coverage of the so-called ‘European refugee crisis’ of 2015–2016. Drawing on qualitative interviews, we inquire into how journalists understand the meaning and purpose of asylum seekers’ personal stories in their news reporting and reflect on the professional values and ethical dilemmas when telling them. Our findings reveal that while journalists tend to sympathise with the vulnerable and see it as important to combat xenophobia and racism, their relationship with asylum seekers becomes increasingly informed and constrained by socio-political and discursive structures that foster a culture of suspicion towards asylum seekers.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, and the American Criminal Justice System: The Perceptions and Experiences of West Indian Men
AN  - 2274303528
AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black–White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change.

T1  - The President Is in: Public Opinion and the Presidential Use of Twitter
AN  - 2313790892
AB  - Analyzing President Trump’s Tweets (N = 30,386) with the first tweet starting from 4 May 2009, this article looks at the nature of his conversations with the public and the building of public support for his candidacy, till he assumed office on January 2017. Drawing theoretically on deliberative democracy and technological populism as performance, this study, among the earliest to use interpretative qualitative analysis, reveals the different themes in his discourse, rather than only highlight specific attributes of his tweets. Our analysis shows that Trump tweets frequently and casts himself as a political outsider who can alone save America. His racist and sexist language with his confrontational style leaves no room for deliberative discourse. His messages may be populist in character, but they are aversive and uncivil and lack normative attributes of deliberation that one would expect in the leader of a powerful nation, such as the United States. These characteristics have been present in his tweets even as a private citizen. This research makes a new contribution to our understanding of how Trump uses Twitter, starting from before he emerged as a contender for the presidential office, and the discourses that emanate from his use of Twitter to make broader inferences about the messages the public is receiving from Trump.

T1  - Ms Marvel, Qahera, and superheroism in the Muslim diaspora: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2193421831
AB  - This article examines how Marvel Comics' Ms Marvel, in her newest iteration as a Pakistani Muslim young woman, challenges the conventions of race and American citizenship in the post-9/11 United States. I place Ms Marvel in conversation with the webcomic Qahera the Superhero, which was created by an Egyptian artist, in order to demonstrate the ways in which both texts have an ability to reach readers on a global scale and powerfully reimagine visual representations of Muslim women and female superheroes. My investigation includes an analysis of the comics and the epitexts that surround these works, such as author and editor interviews and various forms of public response in order to demonstrate how these media engage with a specific racial, ethnic, and (inter)national community in a meaningful way; one which complicates the definition of 'fans,' 'comic book readers,' and 'heroes.' When juxtaposed Ms Marvel and Qahera emerge as artifacts of visual, digital culture whose significance is particularly salient when read in our current political era, as a means of uncovering and combating racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.

T1  - The Impact of Cultural Events on Community Reputation and Pride in Maribor, The European Capital of Culture 2012
AN  - 2064579608
AB  - This paper examines the cultural and social impacts of the European Capital of Culture (ECOC) on the case of the Slovenian city Maribor, the cultural capital of Europe in 2012. The aim is to examine whether geographical area, time, and the level of participation, affect the community reputation and community pride of the citizens. Collection of data occurred twice—at the halfway point, and at the end of the ECOC year—and was conducted on a sample of 2156 citizens from Maribor and 2635 citizens from whole country. The results revealed that, firstly, feelings of community reputation rose during the ECOC year. People from Maribor showed a stronger sense of community reputation than Slovenes. Secondly, people from Maribor were, at the halfway point of the ECOC year, prouder of the event than Slovenes, which changed by the end of the year. Generally, community pride of the ECOC designation improved till the end of the ECOC year, in Slovenes more than in people from Maribor. Thirdly, Slovenes who participated actively in the ECOC events had a higher sense of community reputation than the actively involved people from Maribor. By contrast, passively involved people from Maribor had a stronger sense of community reputation than passively involved Slovenes. The results led to suggestions to organisers of the ECOC events to be aware of the wide impact of the organised events on public opinion for community reputation and pride in a particular city and country.

T1  - QUESTIONING the SUPER-RICH: Representations, Structures, Experiences
AN  - 2230285961
AB  - The authors outline how multiple dimensions-historical and contemporary; global and local; political, economic, social, and cultural-inform an understanding of the super-rich. Recent super-rich scholarship is reviewed with regard to three themes: discourses and representations; mechanisms and structures; experiences and identities. The empirical and conceptual insights of the contents are then highlighted, with regard to the significance of discourses of legitimacy, namely, those of meritocracy, civility, and luxury; the intersections of race and class that underpin assumptions about and representations of wealth; institutional and political-economic dynamics, in relation to international financial systems and property markets; and experiences and attitudes, examined via elites' professional identities and cultural practices. The authors suggest that questioning the super-rich provides an avenue for the study of power in society, how it is reproduced, and how global hierarchies may be shifting. To that end, the articles attempt to make visible the brute force of the infrastructures (politics and policy, cultural and occupational conventions, financial devices and systems) that are occluded by the tendency to focus on the gloss of super-rich lifestyles; to draw attention to the long-term and newly emerging tensions within and between categories of wealth and of elites, and spheres of political, economic, and cultural activity; and to contribute to an understanding of how the accumulation of wealth is perpetuated and excused through discourses of legitimation, structural dynamics, and lived identities. These are much-needed critical interventions at a time of escalating inequality.

T1  - Sexual minority women's attitudes toward infants, children, and parenthood
AN  - 2303793125
AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women's sexual orientation. Two hundred cisgender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood.

T1  - Diversity in Western Countries: Journalism Culture, Migration Integration Policy and Public Opinion
AN  - 2300626872
AB  - Earlier research has shown that public opinion and policy lines on the topic of immigrant integration are interrelated. This article investigates a sample of 24 countries for which data are available in the Migrant Integration Policy Index (MIPEX), the World Values Survey (WVS), as well as in the Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS). To our knowledge, this is the first time that these data are connected to one another to study journalists’ views on their role to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in societies with diverging immigration policies. The WJS presents an analysis of the role conceptions of professional journalists throughout the world, including a variable measuring the extent to which journalists conceive promoting tolerance and cultural diversity as one of their tasks. Our findings show that journalists (as measured in the WJS) mostly tend to promote tolerance and cultural diversity in countries with more restrictive immigration policies (measured by MIPEX) and less emancipative values (measured by the WVS) Promoting tolerance and cultural diversity is associated with a so-called interventionist approach in journalism culture. Furthermore, we used cluster analyses to attribute the countries under study to meaningful, separate groups. More precisely, we discriminate four clusters of the press among the 24 countries under investigation.

AN  - 2297091290
AB  - O presente artigo descreve a trajetória do Etnomídia: Grupo de Estudos em Mídia e Etnicidade, instituído em 1997 na Universidade Federal da Bahia. Quando a Internet civil e comercial era uma novidade, imediata e pioneiramente o grupo colocou seu site na rede de alcance mundial: menos de dois anos do início da expansão e popularização comercial da World Wide Web. Trata-se de pioneiro grupo acadêmico sobre a temática. Embora estudos que descrevem a representação de negros nos meios de comunicação remontem ao final do séc.

This pioneer academic group launched the website when the civil and commercial Internet was a novelty, and 22 years prior to the commercial development and popularization of the world wide web. Studies that describe the representation of blacks in the media go back to the end of the XIX century, starting with Nina Rodrigues, followed by Gilberto Freyre, Roger Bastide, Joao Batista Borges Pereira, Solange Couceiro de Lima, Muniz Sodré Cabral. These researchers, among others, have contributed to meritorious initiatives, and were committed to private projects rather than a formalized type of research. Brazil was a Portuguese colony from 1500 to 1822. With its independence from Portugal, it would become a Monarchy with D. Pedro I (Pedro IV in Portugal), succeeded by his son, Pedro II who was deposed by a military coup of positivist inspiration in November, 1889. During this time, from at least 1532 to 1888, the country's economic structure was based on a slave labor force from Africa. The objective of Etnomídia has been to expose how the descendants of enslaved Africans were portrayed by the media, as well as contribute to overcoming stereotypes and media prejudices by the Brazilian media regarding the image of the Negro.

T1  - Public opposition and the neighborhood effect: How social interaction explains protest against a large infrastructure project
AN  - 2176254288
AB  - In the literature on public opposition against spatial projects, social acceptance is considered a key variable in predicting protest. However, the process by which low levels of social acceptance are translated into real protest actions has received less attention in academia. Social movement theories predict that protest participation is strongly affected by social interaction. This article aims to connect theories on locational conflict with the growing literature on the neighborhood effect in social mobilization by conducting an empirical study of rare and unobtrusive data of protest participation, on the neighborhood level in particular. Our case study focuses on opposition against a highway project in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. Based on a large, geocoded database with addresses of protesters and activists, we build a model to analyze activism and mobilization in neighborhoods. We control for the distance between the neighborhood and the project, as well as the socio-demographic profile of the neighborhood. As expected, we find that distance has a significant impact on the occurrence of protest. Contrary to expectations, the aggregated socio-demographic profile of a neighborhood is not significantly related to levels of opposition. However, the presence of social capital and the presence of active protesters are good predictors of protest participation in the neighborhood. These findings support theories on the collective efficacy of neighborhoods.

T1  - Framing the Participatory Society: Measuring Discrepancies Between Interpretation Frames and Media Frames
AN  - 2430088733
AB  - This research introduces a methodological framework for a valid and reliable analysis of both media and interpretation frames. It responds to recent calls in literature (1) to acknowledge the social–cultural context and power relations underlying framing, (2) to consider frames as a cluster of frame-elements, and (3) to identify interpretation frames and media frames using a similar analytical approach to ensure a valid comparison of the outcomes of both interrelated framing processes. The methodological framework was applied to three studies. Results show that the discrepancy between interpretation frames and media frames revolved around the distinction between bottom-up and top-down frames. The introduced method provides meaningful insights into the complete framing process of both the sender and receiver of communication messages.

T1  - Truly, madly, deeply ... nostalgically? Britain's on-off love affair with refugees, past and present
AN  - 2031357047
AB  - Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of 'history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.

T1  - Is Support for Capitalism Declining around the World? A Free-Market Mentality Index, 1990–2012
AN  - 2333624385
AB  - Is a pro-capitalist mentality waning around the globe? This is not an inconsequential, trivial question because people's mindsets surely influence the laws and policies that are enacted and implemented. Therefore, in the medium and long term, a favorable or an anticapitalist popular culture will help to shape the legal framework that allows market forces to work efficiently, thus affecting economic growth and the well-being of the population. Herbert Grubel finds that support for the free-market paradigm rose worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s (2015, 3). In particular, during that period pro-capitalist beliefs spread among the populations and governments of European countries that had abandoned communism at the end of the Cold War. But Grubel remarks that since 2000 these ideas have lost force. Even in the United States there seems to be a growing preference among voters for government intervention in the market, a trend represented by the elections of Barack Obama and perhaps Donald Trump. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2001 confirms that enthusiasm for a market economy has also diminished considerably in many former socialist countries over the past two decades (Pew Research Center 2001). In addition, in 2012 Pew found a decline in the public perceptions of the benefits of free-market economies in many other countries of the world (Pew Research Center 2012). Globescan (2013) offers more evidence; it conducted several polls for a group of G8 countries from 2002 to 2012, asking people about their belief in free markets. It found a diminishing trend also for the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Surprisingly, the growing global anticapitalist mentality has not been properly measured. Although some efforts have been made, as mentioned earlier, they cover only a limited number of countries and a short span of time or are based on surveys with differing questions. In this paper, I build a Free-Market Mentality Index (FMMI) for many countries for a period of more than two decades, from 1990 to 2012. This consistent and comparable index will allow us to quantify the commitment by the populations of different nations to free-market ideas as well as to describe general trends in different regions of the world. I am conscious that the index constructed is less than perfect and somewhat simple due to the limited data on which it is based. However, it is a first step toward building a global index to capture current economic ideology. Many studies have tried to relate measures of institutional quality with economic performance, but they leave aside the economic views that can be one of the major determinants of the legislation adopted and public policies applied in each country. Other studies have analyzed the relationship between personal attitudes, such as "trust in others," and actual prosperity and growth. This is an interesting approach that follows in spirit of Max Weber's connection between Protestantism and capitalism. However, it is difficult to correlate personal attitudes or even values with a particular economic ideology. Trust, for instance, could be connected to the support of capitalism, but it can also favor a socialist model in which solidary behavior is expected to predominate in society. Individualism can tend either to support free markets or to foment rent-seeking behavior.

T1  - Ascendant India, digital India: how net neutrality advocates defeated Facebook’s Free Basics
AN  - 2012632006
AB  - This article analyzes the 2015 campaign by net neutrality advocates against Facebook’s Free Basics service in India, and argues that their victory can be best understood by analyzing their privileged place in an India that imagines itself high tech and global. The advocates, predominantly tech workers, loosely organized under the banner of Save the Internet (STI) echoing the net neutrality debate in the United States. The article assesses the competing claims and modes of contention of both Facebook and STI, and examines how STI’s appeals were able to mobilize public opinion in record numbers. I argue that STI formed a ‘recursive public’, which practiced a technopolitics that resonated within the broader narrative of technocultural nationalism championed by the current ruling party. I trace the historical origins of this dominant discourse that eventually led the regulator to ban all zero-ratings plans, including Free Basics.

T1  - Chronicle of a death foretold: The Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand and the 2017 election
AN  - 1983661167
AB  - The Green Party entered the 2017 election campaign from a position of relative strength. As shown in Table 1 and described in O'Brien (2013), recent elections had seen the Green Party capitalise on public dissatisfaction with the Labour Party (the main opposition party). They were able to expand their vote to breakthrough as a 'medium' rather than minor party, consistently polling over 10% and as high as 13% since early 2015 (see Figure 1). In the face of Labour's ongoing difficulties and the lack of other competitors for progressive votes, they were able to present themselves as a credible third force, effectively challenging the governing National Party. This transition had been accompanied with a stable message that associated action on environmental issues with broader areas of social justice and economic performance, their 2014 manifesto being framed around three messages or strands: "Cleaner environment', 'Fairer society' and 'Smarter economy'. A critical turning point came at the Annual General Meeting and campaign launch in July 2017. Highlighting the need for social welfare reform, Green co-leader Metiria Turei revealed that she had committed minor social welfare fraud as a sole parent in the 1990s. Intended to highlight the difficulties associated with surviving in poverty, this initially appears to have had little negative effect on the Green Party. Two subsequent opinion polls showed Green support increasingly slightly in one and significantly in the other (from 11% to 15%), with support from Labour continuing to decline. This led one former Green MP to claim that the Party was now attracting Labour's core supporters and was on track to grow even further (RNZ National 2017).

AN  - 2187918351
AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image.Alternate abstract:S obzirom na porast udjela starije populacije u većini društava, čini se važnim istražiti ovu problematiku s različitih aspekata u cilju poboljšanja položaja starijih i prepoznavanja njihovog doprinosa u društvu. Cilj istraživanja bio je ispitati iskustva i mišljenja generacije Z, o predrasudama i diskriminaciji prema starijim osobama. Ispitanici su bili mlađe životne dobi, prema starosti pripadaju generaciji Z. Podaci su prikupljeni putem fokus grupe, a koristila su se pitanja otvorenog tipa. Rezultati kvalitativnog istraživanja ukazuju na: 1) nepovoljan odnos društva prema starijim osobama, 2) uzroke diskriminacije starijih osoba, 3) predrasude prema starijim osobama. Bolja edukacija (posebno djece i mladih), neposredni kontakt sa starijim osobama (omogućavanje susreta za razmjenu iskustava te prenošenja tradicijskih i kulturnih vrijednosti), te bolja medijska prezentacija starenja i starosti doprinijela bi smanjenju globalizacije starenja i boljem odnosu mlađih generacija prema starenju. Važan utjecaj na poglede mladih ima obitelj i potrebno je motivirati roditelje da pozitivno prezentiraju starenje i starost. Također, važno je raditi i sa starijim osobama u smislu njihovog osnaživanja i razvijanja pozitivnije slike o sebi.

T1  - Power, privilege and justice: intersectionality as human rights?
AN  - 1972464008
AB  - How can we best connect and understand issues of power, privilege and justice in a human rights framework? One approach is to explicitly position intersectionality as a theoretical lens that can assist a critical understanding of the connections between these concepts and realities. The paper does this through an examination of the situation in Scotland via Show Racism the Red Card, an anti-racist non-governmental organisation that works with school-age children to raise awareness on the power of prejudice and discrimination in everyday, interrelated lives. It is shown that despite its complexities, intersectionality can work both conceptually and methodologically in complex environments such as classrooms. The realisation of rights is foregrounded and an appreciation of context, politics, social divisions and outcomes vis-à-vis inclusive equalities needs to be fully grasped. The case study of Show Racism the Red Card situates the nuances of intersectionality as both theory and method, illustrating the need for human rights to be mindful of past, present and future. Overall, it is argued that the example of Scotland offers opportunities to witness a critique of how power, privilege and justice are connected and challenged in a human rights context and how rights can be realised in everyday settings.

T1  - The "Trojan Horse" Plot and the Fear of Muslim Power in British State Schools
AN  - 1975714238
AB  - In 2014, an alleged "Trojan Horse" plot to Islamise education in a number of schools attended predominantly by diverse Muslim pupils in the inner city wards of Birmingham raised considerable questions. Ofsted investigations of 21 schools explored these concerns at the behest of the then Secretary of State for Education, Michael Gove MP. At the head of this so-called plot, a certain Tahir Alam, once a darling of New Labour's policies on British Muslim schools, faced the brunt of the media and political furore. Based on a series of face-to-face interviews with Alam in 2015 and 2016, this paper provides a detailed insight into the allegations, the context in which they emerged and the implications raised for young Muslims in the education system. Ultimately, as part of the government's counter-terrorism policy the accusations of the "Islamisation" of education in these "Trojan Horse" schools foreshadowed the additional securitisation of all sectors of education. However, there was neither the evidence nor the legal justification to ratchet up anti-extremism education measures that eventually followed; namely the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. The consequences of the negative attention heightened existing Islamophobia but, paradoxically, they also limited the opportunities for de-radicalisation through education.

T1  - Introduction to BJS special issue
AN  - 1961334714
AB  - The articles in this issue were all commissioned in the immediate aftermath of the UK’s Brexit referendum result in June 2016 and the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in November 2016 to present a rapid sociological response to the challenges and questions posed by these tumultuous events. Ostensibly these are two very different kinds of political events. The Brexit referendum in the UK was an unprecedented popular vote on Britain’s membership of the European Union, whereas Trump was elected as a Republican candidate during the usual cycle of presidential elections. Notwithstanding the prominence of politicians such as Nigel Farage or Boris Johnson, Brexit was not focused around specific individual leaders, whereas the figure of Trump himself looms indelibly large in the American case. Brexit will be bound to have huge long-term constitutional implications for the UK, whereas Trump’s victory might have less fundamental consequences. And yet, there is also a clear sense of resonances between these two political events. Some of these resonances are superficial. Both were ‘radically unexpected’. The media, political institutions, and what might be termed ‘public opinion’ – at least of the liberal commentariat – was shocked by the unexpected results. They thus both speak to what might be termed the collapse of a certain kind of ‘liberal political rationality’, in which the political ‘rules of the game’ were well established and could lead to generally predictable outcomes within normally expected limits.

T1  - Alternative Views and Eroding Support: The Conditional Indirect Effects of Foreign Media and Internet Use on Regime Support in China
AN  - 2506669487
AB  - Increased access to information poses a threat to authoritarian rulers’ hold on power. In this article, we assess the relationship between use of the Internet and foreign media on regime support in China using data from the Asian Barometer survey. Based on the O-S-O-R model, we examine whether use of the Internet and foreign media correlate with lower levels of regime support, and whether there are indirect effects of media use through trust in the Chinese government. We also examine whether these indirect effects vary by national pride. Results show indirect effects through trust for the Internet and some evidence of an indirect effect for foreign media. We also find that national pride moderates the indirect effects of Internet use.

T1  - Antiracism apps: framing understandings and approaches to antiracism education and intervention
AN  - 1914571054
AB  - Mobile apps for antiracism have become valuable pedagogical and activist tools for their real-time and mapping capabilities, their portability and intimate bodily presence, which enables a reaction exactly when an act of racism occurs. In this article, five mobile apps aimed at producing antiracism education or intervention outcomes from the United Kingdom, Australia and France are the focus of an interrogation of the ways in which racism and antiracism are framed and the strengths and weaknesses of these initiatives for countering dominant forms of everyday racism. We identify a number of different approaches to racism and antiracism in our inquiry, which lead to particular sets of aims, features and uses: the app as a tool for capturing, reporting and responding to racist acts; as a way of reinforcing a wider sense of community identity and solidarity; to demonstrate racism, especially Islamophobia, and make its forms visible, and as a means for challenging racism through raising awareness and encouraging bystanders to oppose it. We argue that while these apps are well disposed to exposing and manifesting isolated incidents of racism in everyday life, we question their potential for transformative societal outcomes beyond the level of unilateral action in the context of events experienced as unique incidents.

T1  - Selective Exposure and Hostile Media Perceptions During Election Campaigns
AN  - 2502808668
AB  - How partisans select and perceive political news during election campaigns is an important question in political communication research. This article interrelates two prominent concepts: the selective exposure and the hostile media paradigms. I argue that some media outlets are more likely than others to be selected based on political preferences and that the partisan leanings of these outlets are perceived as friendly by their audiences. Other outlets are selected regardless of political alignment. Here I expect to find hostile media perceptions. An analysis of representative survey data from the 2009 and 2013 German national election studies reveals support for the proposed pattern. However, the overall magnitudes of selective exposure and bias perceptions are limited in the campaigns under investigation.

T1  - Linguistic Anthropology in 2016: Now What?
AN  - 1902296385
AB  - In this review, I extend the ideological and discursive insights on prejudice and racism offered by Jane Hill in her work The Everyday Language of White Racism to consider the potential of linguistic anthropology to address social injustice. In a year marked by the global rise of right-wing politics, 2016 cannot simply be viewed as business as usual, but rather calls for a reevaluation of the potential of linguistic anthropology in light of what it can do now. The essay is thematically organized to focus on the production of value and the reproduction of inequality over a wide range of modalities and research contexts. I begin with the "Metrics of Analysis" to review conceptual frameworks through which ethnographic analysis has been undertaken, such as temporality, scale, multimodality, technology, discourse studies, and others. The sections that follow expand upon these themes across three broad headings. The first, "Participation and Social (In)Justice," addresses the complex agendas and institutional processes that mediate linguistic struggles for equality in settler colonial and indigenous contexts, political language, racism and social justice, and the affordances and limitations of language for young people. The second, "Global Ethnonationalism," builds on a language ideology framework to examine the study of minority languages, the language of right-wing religiosity, and the contradictions of national branding. The third explores "Epistemologies of Value" via performativity, embodiment, sound, materiality, ontology, and media. The essay concludes with potential directions for linguistic anthropologists to address the worldwide "alt-" realities that have come into clearer view. [ethnonationalism, language ideology, race, semiotics, social justice]Alternate abstract:En esta revisión extiendo el conocimiento ideológico y discursivo sobre prejuicio y racismo ofrecido por Jane Hill en su trabajo El lenguaje diario del racismo blanco para considerar el potencial de la antropología linguística en el abordaje de la injusticia social. En un año marcado por el crecimiento global de las políticas de derecha, 2016 no puede simplemente ser visto de manera habitual, sino en cambio requiere una revaluación del potencial de la antropología linguística a la luz de lo que puede hacer ahora. El ensayo está temáticamente organizado, concentrándose en la producción de valor y la reproducción de desigualdad sobre un amplio rango de modalidades y contextos de investigación. Empiezo con "Métricas de Análisis" para revisar marcos conceptuales a través de los cuales el análisis etnográfico ha sido emprendido, tales como temporalidad, escala, multimodalidad, tecnología, estudios discursivos, y otros. Las tres secciones siguientes expanden estos temas a través de tres líneas generales. La primera, "Participación e (In)Justicia Social", aborda las agendas complejas y los procesos institucionales que median las luchas linguísticas por la igualdad en contextos de pobladores coloniales e indígenas, lenguaje político, racismo y justicia social, y la asequibilidad y limitaciones del lenguaje para gente joven. La segunda, "Etnonacionalismo Global", se basa en un marco lenguaje-ideología para estudiar los lenguajes minoritarios, el lenguaje de la religiosidad de la derecha, y las contradicciones del etiquetamiento nacional. La tercera explora las "Epistemologías de Valor", vía performatividad, corporeización, sonido, materialidad, ontología, y medios de comunicación. El ensayo concluye con direcciones potenciales para los antropólogos linguísticos para abordar las realidades "alt-" a nivel mundial que han llegado a ser más claras.

T1  - Of Security and Liberty, of Control and Cooperation. Terrorism and the New Ecosystem of Communication
AN  - 1914861338
AB  - The Interconnected Society - a global ecosystem of limited rationality founded on the interdependence of systems and on the processing of information and knowledge (a new paradigm) (Dominici, 2014) - reveals itself, in fact, not only as the underlying structure of digital capitalism and of the sharing economy (Dominici, 1998), but above all, in relation to the issues considered in this essay, as the ideal communicative habitat for criminal and terrorist organizations. Here they can both plan and carry out propagandistic initiatives capable of deeply conditioning individual and collective perception, fears, uncertainty, risk awareness and the social acceptance of risk, and in general, public opinion and the collective imagination, exposed, as never before, to the emotional flare-ups of the global media system. Public opinion(s), which are more and more easily conditioned, are in turn capable of putting pressure on politics, which is expected, despite having itself become weaker and weaker with respect to financial and economic powers, to provide solutions and to make choices of transnational relevance. The network and the ecosystems of complex connectivity have been acting for some time as the main lever for bringing this conflict, which displays facets today which are completely different from those in the past, towards a strategic, not to say crucial praxis, both on a micro and a macro plane: a communication plan scattering in all directions, going viral in real time.

T1  - From Lew Alcindor to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Race, Religion, and Representation in Basketball, 1968-1975
AN  - 1898587043
AB  - From 1968 to 1975, Lew Alcindor/Kareem Abdul-Jabbar traveled a turbulent personal path toward self-discovery. His journey had profound implications for the larger cultural landscape of race, sport, politics, and religion. As he became professional basketball's chief superstar, he was framed by the press as sullen and solitary, and he served as the villain in a media-driven storyline informed by popular prejudices. Yet for many African Americans and other progressive fans, he exemplified the ideals that made black power uplifting and affirmative, rather than threatening. His conversion to Islam and his name change further shaped new cultural and political territory for the black athlete. It highlighted a personal struggle within Abdul-Jabbar - he sought a kind of personal freedom, even as he revealed a tendency to subsume himself before strong authority figures. He nevertheless stood, in this period, as the nation's most prominent face of classical Islam. His religious conversion further distanced him from much of the American public, but over time he presented an effective, progressive narrative about the place of Islam in American life.

T1  - The art of goalkeeping: memorializing Lev Yashin
AN  - 1875839298
AB  - Lev Yashin remains, in the eyes of many, the greatest goalkeeper, ever to have played the game of football. Since his death in 1990, coinciding with the dying days of the Soviet Union, his legacy has played an important role in post-Soviet history, a factor that is gaining more importance as Russia prepares to host the 2018 World Cup tournament. Yashin's memory is notably being maintained in the public perception not least through the material form of two key sculptures erected in Moscow in the late 1990s. Yet these works, part of a wider international trend to memorialize footballers in the form of public monuments, offer more than a unique insight into Yashin's career, status and reputation. They also address concerns about the relationship between art and sport as it emerged historically in the Soviet Union and how that cultural legacy is being re-explored in a post-Soviet context. Accordingly this essay examines these two key examples of football statuary as significant case studies through which issues relating to Soviet sport, history and art can be more widely analysed.

T1  - The effect of public support on investment and R&D: An empirical evaluation on European manufacturing firms
AN  - 1895828172
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of government support on investment and on R&D expenditure. The empirical analysis is based on a large representative and cross-country comparative sample of manufacturing firms across seven European countries. Estimates from a non-parametric matching procedure suggest that public grants have a positive effect both on firms' investment and R&D, implying that recipient firms spend more than they would have without public aid. This may suggest that the possibility of perfect crowding out between private and public funds can be rejected. More in detail, grants appear to consistently affect traditional investment and similarly, R&D incentives have a positive impact on research spending. The paper also finds that grants trigger the use of long medium term credit suggesting that public policy may possibly help firms facing financial constraints and foster their growth. Finally, the analysis reveals some heterogeneity across the seven countries considered.

T1  - Perceptions of diversity and attitudes of tolerance in the 'fragmented' U.K.
AN  - 2076973729
AB  - Relying on a quantitative survey (n = 1497) and semi-structured interviews (n = 30) conducted in the U.K., we explore British nationals', Romanian and Turkish migrants' attitudes of tolerance and the factors influencing them in the current socio-political context in the U.K. The quantitative data reveal the role of younger age, diverse networks, higher education, attachment to city/region and supranational identifications in more open attitudes towards diversity. The qualitative findings illustrate how diverse these three groups' attitudes of tolerance can be and how they are affected by their position and status in the U.K. The British' attitudes show their tolerance can reflect diverse forms of acceptance of ethnic and cultural differences but can also draw lines in terms of civic values opposing 'those who contribute to society' versus those who 'live as parasites'. The Turks are in favour of diversity with the expectation of receiving more civic rights and facing less prejudice. The Romanians tend to have a more ambiguous relation to diversity given their position of stigmatised migrants in the U.K. Our analysis reveal how inclusive or exclusive people's (sub- and supra-)national identities can be and how these frame their attitudes of tolerance.

T1  - Cultural Expressions of Social Class and Their Implications for Group-Related Beliefs and Behaviors
AN  - 1878226288
AB  - In the wake of the Great Recession, rising inequality has increased social-class disparities between people in society. In this research, we examine how differences in social class shape unique patterns of cultural expression, and how these cultural expressions affirm ingroup beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 113), we provide evidence that cultural expressions of social class on an online social network can signal the social class of targets: by simply viewing the cultural practices of individuals captured in uploaded Facebook photographs, individuals express their social class in ways that allow it to be perceived by strangers at levels that are above chance accuracy. In Study 2 (N = 78), we provide evidence that individuals express their own ingroup space differently based on social class: Class-specific cultural practices (including interests in education, arts, newspapers, TV, and shopping) have implications for ingroup-related beliefs and political organizing. Individuals who reported being lower in subjective social class, relative to those reporting higher subjective social class, show cultural practices that relate to recognizing the ingroup's relative lack of control (lower group efficacy) and, in turn, a tendency to remain politically inactive when faced with an ingroup-related social disadvantage. In sum, our research provides evidence suggesting that expressions of culture derived from one's social class have the capacity to create and maintain social-class boundaries between individuals. Practical and political implications are discussed.

T1  - Pictorial stereotypes and images in the Euro debt crisis
AN  - 1862143832
AB  - In the Euro debt crisis, it is hardly surprising that reciprocal stereotyping is carrying the day in the national media reviving old images of the respective 'other'. The study asks how covers of German news magazines are shaped by the use of national stereotypes and images when reporting about this crisis. The paper seeks to build a bridge between the seemingly distanced disciplines arts and political science by offering a lean framework for analysis. It uses some cover images taken from two German weeklies and modifies Panofsky's semiotic model revealing traditional stereotypes and images of Greece.

T1  - Understanding revenge pornography: public perceptions of revenge pornography and victim blaming
TT  - Understanding revenge pornography
AN  - 2533894291
AB  - PurposeThe disclosure of private images with the intent of causing distress is often described as “revenge pornography”. In the UK, this newly legislated crime has received a high level of media attention following several high profile cases, however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approachIn total, 168 adults (UK general public) completed an online survey using a vignette approach. Views of the influence of perpetrator-victim relationship length and reason for termination were considered alongside perception of an offence, the necessity of police intervention, what extent revenge pornography creates psychological harm in victims, and victim blaming.FindingsPerpetrator-victim relationship length and reason for relationship breakdown did not influence perceptions of victim blame. Participants believed that the situation described in the vignettes was likely to be an offence, and that police intervention is somewhat necessary. Participants believed that the scenario was “very likely” to create fear, and “moderately likely” to create psychological/mental harm in victims. In line with the literature relating to stalking and sexual assault, men blamed the victim significantly more than women. Furthermore, women rated police intervention as significantly more necessary than men.Research limitations/implicationsThe public are recognising that revenge pornography is an offence, with consequences being fear and psychological harm, showing an awareness of the impact on victims. However, there are sex differences in the perceptions of revenge pornography and victim blaming, and this could be addressed by raising awareness of this crime. This research, which highlights that the public are aware of some of the harm caused, may encourage victims in coming forward to report such a crime.Originality/valueThere is a paucity of research into revenge pornography, and this study is one of the first in this area.

T1  - ATTITUDE OF EDUCATED URBAN YOUTH TOWARDS RAPE MYTHS
AN  - 1916318067
AB  - Pakistan, being a signatory to almost all international conventions on human rights, stands committed to ending violence against women. Additionally, various national progressive legislation and policies for the protection of women' rights have been initiated during the last couple of years, but the statistics of cases of violence against women in Pakistan are bothersome. Women enduring this agony and mortifying experience may have to face all sorts of negative attitudes of people around them. This study investigated gender differences among university students in their perceptions towards rape myths about female rape victims. Students' perceptions were measured using the indigenous Rape Myth Scale by collecting data from 385 students from the three universities of Lahore. Additionally, information about the demographics of students regarding academic disciplines, residential areas and socio-economic backgrounds of families were also collected. Data was analyzed by using the t-test and ANOVA. The results revealed a significant gender difference in the perception of respondents, all of whom were educated about rape myths. Male students were found to believe more strongly that a woman's willingness is present in rape, women's strong character would prevent them from getting raped, and women's behaviour and dress attracted rapists. Furthermore, the results indicated that academic discipline, residential city and parental socioeconomic background of students were found to play an influential part in determining their perceptions towards rape myths. The findings imply a need to incorporate a gender-sensitive education programme as a part of the curriculum across disciplines at the university level, in order to nurture gender sensitization in society. In this regard, parents, teachers and media, along with policymakers, can play a meaningful role in curbing the incidence of rape by transforming the social mindset of blaming the rape sufferer.

T1  - Edges of Empire
AN  - 1803326380
AB  - This essay explores the rather neglected case of Italian colonialism, and in particular, the ways in which colonial traces still linger on in Italian contemporary representations, reconfirming or transforming stereotypes and prejudices regarding issues of otherness, ethnicity, and sexuality, which are specific to the Italian case. Although Italian colonialism is subject to denial and oblivion, it is important to account for a growing postcolonial awareness, both in the scholarly field and in the wider cultural context, to better understand current issues of migration that are affecting Europe and challenging its global role as a democratic institution. The focus of the essay is on colonial photography and contemporary visual culture, pertaining to the fields of media, art, and politics. The goal is to detect the specificities of the Italian colonial legacy in contemporary culture, analyzing contemporary art production as well as figures such as football star Mario Balotelli and Italy's first Black minister Cécile Kyenge, while also accounting for the larger European dimension, connecting and drawing parallels with transnational debates on postcolonial representations of gender and race.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - Amitai Etzioni, Privacy in a Cyber Age: Policy and Practice
AN  - 1781101362
AB  - Amitia Etzioni pondered privacy rights in The Limits of Privacy (1999). He returns to the topic in Privacy in a Cyber Age: Policy and Practice, this time focusing on new technologies for government to gather and analyze data. Privacy against government, Etzioni believes, provides fertile ground for his communitarian philosophy of split differences, moderation, reasonableness. The Constitution phrases many rights in absolute terms: "Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech." The Fourth Amendment, by contrast, protects against "unreasonable searches and seizures." Reasonable searches are permissible and unreasonable ones aren't, which, according to Etzioni, makes the Fourth Amendment "a prime example of a liberal communitarian text." You needn't embrace Etzioni's prescriptions for Fourth Amendment jurisprudence to share his view that the doctrine needs revamping. Start with "reasonable expectation of privacy," the oft-applied test that first arose in Katz v. United States (1967). At issue in Katz was a recording device placed atop a phone booth, where it picked up the defendants half of an incriminating call. Did police need a warrant? The government said no: The Fourth Amendment might apply inside the booth, but the recorder was outside, in the elements. But the Supreme Court rejected the inside-outside line and declared that "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places." In a concurring opinion, Justice John Marshall Harlan remarked that the Fourth Amendments applicability depends on whether the person had "a reasonable expectation of privacy." That phrase has been the heart of Fourth Amendment law for nearly 50 years.

T1  - Overarching findings
AN  - 1863793839
AB  - The issue of racism in the Australian Football League (AFL) is one that has been officially recognized since 1995. Since then, the AFL, the AFL Players Association (AFLPA) and the AFL clubs have been bound by the rules of the code, specifically Rule 35, to deal with racism, racial and religious intolerance and racist abuse, as well as other forms of vilification, when it has arisen. The most recent player-to-player vilification incident occurred in 2011 and involved Western Bulldogs forward Justin Sherman and Gold Coast Sun defender Joel Wilkinson. Despite the problems that many had with Sherman’s suspension, which still allowed him to play with the Western reserves side, what was very marked was the speed of the process from the lodgement of complaint to the suspension. This would seem to indicate that when it comes to such matters, the AFL is serious about dealing with racial vilification and it wanted to send a message to all the clubs and players. In the weeks and months after the incident, what become quite evident was the damage Sherman has sustained to his reputation as a professional athlete: his ‘brand’ is tarnished from here on. Furthermore, the overarching message from this incident as it related to the AFL was that racism in any form is wrong and it will not be tolerated. The main aims of this project were to assess the ways that AFL players have engaged with the education programmes and professional development offered, and how they understand issues of race, racism, ethnicity and difference within the professional environment of elite football in the AFL, and by association, the everyday. The reason for this is the length of time that has passed since Michael Long made his stance in 1995 and the resources that have gone into educating the players on these matters. What this book is seeking to provide is an understanding of the efficacy of those programmes in educating professional elite athletes about racial and religious issues within the AFL and also the athletes’ everyday lives and extended communities. This is important given that the AFL has become an international and national leader on this issue and its corporate and community standing is heavily connected to by Rule 35 and its associated programmes.

T1  - Emotional duplex in the nation (de-)branding: a case study of China and Shen Yun Performing Arts
AN  - 1796286718
AB  - The intricate connection between nation branding efforts and the emotions they evoke has been inadequately addressed in existing branding and international relations literature. I propose a heuristic account that theorizes this relationship. By tracing the branding efforts made by China and the de-branding efforts made by Shen Yun Performing Arts (a troupe established by Falun Gong practitioners), I argue that these "authentic" Chinese cultural presentations elicit certain emotions. The emotional works are different for Chinese domestic audiences and for international audiences. I propose a duplex model to account for the emotional processes in these two groups of audiences. Four operating emotions -- pride, guilt, admiration, and anger -- solidify into various political attitudes toward China. Finally, I discuss the contributions of this duplex model and its further complications. [web URL: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15295036.2015.1129547]

T1  - Framing PIGS: patterns of racism and neocolonialism in the Euro crisis
AN  - 1784145009
AB  - Van Vossole's article explores the racist framing of the peripheral member states of the European Union, the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland (and/or Italy), Greece and Spain). It demonstrates a strong connection between the processes of racialization and depoliticization, as well as the return of colonial dynamics in the Eurozone. Side-stepping political economy and history, the culturalization of politics perfectly complements the 'post-political' neoliberal hegemony. Political and media discourses reproduce it in both populist and corporate interests. The culturalization of politics reduces the differences between centre and periphery to certain 'cultural characteristics and habits', as reflected in stereotypes of laziness, non-productivity, corruption, wasteful spending and lying. These make it possible to blame the PIGS for the current crisis, legitimizing drastic austerity measures and a loss of sovereignty. The loss of sovereignty shows remarkable similarities with what Kwame Nkrumah defined as neocolonialism: the continuation of colonial power relations through processes of economic dependence, conditional aid and cultural hegemony. While this problematic only resurfaced during the recent Euro crisis, Van Vossole discusses how today's racist discourses and neocolonial politics have their roots in the past, particularly in anti-Irish and anti-Mediterranean racism and in the (semi-)colonial position of the PIGS in the British and Ottoman empires. Besides structural violence against the periphery, a major consequence of this racialization is that it jeopardizes any possibility of further democratic political integration on the basis of a common European identity.

T1  - Sexualized Avatars Lead to Women's Self-Objectification and Acceptance of Rape Myths
AN  - 1752994178; 201601733
AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

T1  - 'The Good, Pure Old Days': Cyclist's Switching Appraisals of Doping before and after Retirement as Claims Making in the Construction of Doping as a Social Problem
AN  - 1680150964; 201514780
AB  - According to our interpretation of the model of technological continuity and change proposed by the media scholar Brian Winston, prominent former athletes influential with the public opinion could be seen as embodying 'the law of suppression of the radical potential' of innovation with performance-enhancement techniques and substances (PETS), as opposed to the entrepreneurial role in this field they adopted when they were still active, embodying the 'supervening social necessity' which push forward these innovation processes. This paper documents this dialectic by comparing the lenient and understanding attitudes and stances on PETS of prominent cyclists when still active with their radical rejection of doping and dopers once retired. Their claims, and those of the dominant paradigm in scholarly accounts of the history of PETS, about an alleged qualitative and quantitative 'worsening' of 'the doping problem' in the last 40-50 years, are thoroughly examined and criticised. It is concluded that a number of prominent retired athletes have become claims-makers successfully involved in the construction of 'the social problem of doping' through their nostalgic appraisals of the evolution of PETS usage, despite these appraisals being mostly baseless on rational grounds.

T1  - Ambivalent Sexism and the Sexual Double Standard
AN  - 1680154408; 201517839
AB  - The sexual double standard is the notion that women are evaluated negatively and men positively for engaging in similar sexual behaviors. Because traditional, gender-based stereotypes are reflected in the attitudes that people hold towards men and women, it is likely that sexism plays a part in the manifestation of the double standard. The goal of the present study is to investigate the relationship between sexism (prejudice against individuals based on their gender) and the sexual double standard. There are two types of sexism: hostile (negative prejudice) and benevolent (positive prejudice). We hypothesized that participants displaying high levels of either type of sexism would be most likely to exhibit the sexual double standard. A US-sample of 232 undergraduates from a Southwestern university completed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI) and the Ambivalence Towards Men Inventory (AMI) and then evaluated a hypothetical target individual who reported having zero, one or 12 sexual partners. Results show that participants' sexist attitudes towards men and women were related to their exhibition of the sexual double standard. Specifically, men and women's hostile attitudes towards targets of their own gender were related to negative evaluations of highly sexually active targets of the same gender, while men and women's benevolent attitudes towards the opposite gender were related to positive evaluation of highly sexually active targets of the opposite gender. Implications of the present results and directions for future research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Spontaneous or controlled: Overall structural organization of political phone-ins in two countries and their relations to societal norms
AN  - 1735657079; 201537257
AB  - This study describes the differing overall structural organization of political radio phone-in interactions in Israel and the USA. The American phone-in is highly organized, tightly controlled by the host, who knows and introduces the caller at the opening, and closes the interaction unilaterally. In the Israeli phone-in, the opening resembles the mundane phone call: the call-taker acts as if he responds to a summons, there are greeting sequences, and the caller has the task of self-identification, since hosts do not know with whom they talk. Closings in Israel are negotiated and include pre-closings and closing sequences. Unlike the US structure, the Israeli structure promotes non-hierarchical institutional relations between participants, akin to mundane relations, often taken as relations between equals. The conclusion connects the overall structural organizations with the communication patterns in each society, suggesting phone-ins are one site that resonates and recreates societal norms.

T1  - Stadium as public sphere
AN  - 1660020415; 201506520
AB  - Though spectator sport is often understood as escapist entertainment, stadiums regularly aggregate thousands of citizens in close physical space, thus making political expression achievable, if not unavoidable. Political expressions at sporting events are actively discouraged by sport commentators, politicians and other authorities. In contrast, this essay underscores how and why the sporting stadium should be considered a vital political space. Theories of the public sphere guide how we understand the construction of political views. Physical space is a key element that encourages or constricts dissent. Mass mediation amplifies certain forms of public discourse. With conceptions of the public sphere, space and media, the essay analyses the Italian football stadium that, within the context of Italian cultural and political life, has been a prominent stage for political expression. To conclude, I draw comparisons with the American sporting stadium and question the 'a-political' mentality that threatens to dominate the stands. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Improving Intergroup Attitudes through Televised Vicarious Intergroup Contact: Social Cognitive Processing of Ingroup and Outgroup Information
AN  - 1738477514; 201538487
AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U.S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Escalation of Ethnonationalist Radicalization: Simulating the Effectiveness of Nationalist Ideologies
AN  - 1692290635; 201520941
AB  - This article describes an agent-based simulation model of ethnonationalist radicalization between political actors and their constituencies based upon evidence from the former Yugoslavia. The central mechanism is the recursive feedback between political and cultural dynamics, focusing on processes prior to the outbreak of actual violence. The results offer theoretical insights by revealing mechanisms that lead to escalation. These can be found within politics as well as among the population: between conflicting ethnically homogeneous regions, opposing radicalization forces fuel an escalation spiral. These processes are driven by political influences. Challenging the theory that diversity breeds conflict, this suggests that multiethnic regions are more capable of withstanding political pressures. However, they are vulnerable to imported violence, driven by the local population. This finding is tested with a different model of the same events, in which different implemented mechanisms generate results, in line with the diversity-breeds-conflict theory. A comparative discussion demonstrates how simulation is sensitive to theoretical predispositions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Believing is Seeing: Korean Immigrants' Perception of the Former South Korean President Roh
AN  - 1510495633
AB  - This study explores how individual characteristics interact with news media choice and people's perception of mediated news events and public figures focusing on South Korean immigrants' perception of the former South Korean President Roh. Thirteen South Korean immigrants were interviewed, and the results demonstrate a three-way relationship between (a) interviewees' political orientation, (b) media choice, and (c) perception of Roh and the newspapers. The interviewees supporting Roh, who read online news on a regular basis but did not read conservative newspapers, recognized the political claim that the oligopoly of the conservative newspapers has influenced public opinion on Roh, while the readers of the conservative newspapers, who do not read on-line news, did not acknowledge the claim. Individuals' opinions on Roh and the newspapers were not directed by media framing, but interviewees selectively chose what they read and accept. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gender Differences in Health Symptoms Associated with the Exposure to Physical Violence in Family: Data from the 2006 National Health Survey in Serbia
AN  - 1504423878; 201407805
AB  - This study analyzed gender differences in exposure to family violence in Serbia and its association with health symptoms. Using data from the National Health Survey 2006 in Serbia, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were run to examine the association between exposure to physical violence in the family (in the past 12 months) and the occurrence of 15 different health symptoms (in the past 4 weeks). Out of 12,646 interviewed adults (older than 20), women reported experiencing family violence nearly 1.7 times more often than men (1.28 % vs. 0.75 %). Women had nine health symptoms significantly associated with experienced violence, while men had four, even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Depression and insomnia were common for both genders. Results suggest that physicians should pay attention to health complaints, consider family violence as an associated factor, and address violence in a gender sensitive way that is free of prejudice and preconceptions.

T1  - The Stigma of Schizophrenia in Romanian Newspapers: a Content Analysis Approach
AN  - 1566174685
AB  - For most people, media are an important source of information about mental health. Inadequate coverage of mental illness may have a negative impact on public attitudes toward consumers of mental health services. The aim of this article is to identify the content and quality of newspaper articles reporting on schizophrenia. Articles between 2008 and 2011 were analyzed (N=79). First, we used a frame of reference for identifying depictions of schizophrenia in newspapers, proposed by Knifton et al. (2008). Second, after analyzing several media guidelines for reporting on schizophrenia, we derived key indicators of quality reporting, including labels, trivialization of illness and unbalanced storyline. The results show that diere were more negative themes than positive ones. Moreover, while the percentage of the dangerousness theme (38%) was higher than the overall percentage of positive themes (22%), discrimination was the least debated issue (6%). In regard to labels, the most prevalent (63%) had a low level of political correctness ("mentally ill", "mental patient"). The stories were unbalanced, portraying persons with schizophrenia as victims of the illness and as offenders. It appears that the media take a more negative stance towards schizophrenia, spreading a distorted image of people with schizophrenia, which might contribute to stigma.

T1  - The Italian public sphere: a case of dramatized polarization
AN  - 1463014931; 201346855
AB  - This contribution is organized along two main interpretive lines. First: the Italian public sphere is very polarized because of well-established historical attitudes, a crowded media market and new technologies that push towards segmentation of the audience. The arrival of Berlusconi has only reinforced the already existing polarization that goes well beyond the borders of partisanship involving the content of news, the structure and professionalism of news outlets and also the recipients that divide themselves along the lines of political attitudes. The second characteristic feature of the Italian public sphere involves the tendency towards dramatization, which is also produced by the sudden commercialization of the entire mass media system that started in 1980. This article's thesis is supported by examples of dramatization and extreme political discourse. The consequences that derive from this situation are discussed in the conclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do information-rich contexts reduce knowledge inequalities? The contextual determinants of political knowledge in Europe
AN  - 1319999744
AB  - This article makes a contribution to the study of the determinants of political knowledge from a comparative perspective. Along with the usual suspects explaining knowledge at the individual level (that is, individual differences in motivation, ability and exposure to political news in the media), this article analyses the extent to which socio-economic, political and communicational contexts affect what people know about politics. More importantly, the article analyses whether information-rich contexts contribute towards reducing inequalities in knowledge. The results are obtained via two-level hierarchical linear models using the 2009 European Election Studies, Voter Study and confirm that citizens' levels of political knowledge are driven by the context. They also demonstrate that information-rich environments crucially narrow knowledge inequalities between high- and low-status citizens. These findings thus suggest that socio-economic policies have the capacity to alter the balance between the information-rich and the information-poor. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The horror at Fort Hood: disseminating American exceptionalism
AN  - 1933626648
AB  - American exceptionalism - the constitutive myth of American national identity - has been disseminated through literature, film, and foreign policy. This article analyzes another site: online comments in response to the New York Times coverage of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. It is a site in which citizens participate in myth-making and maintenance. This article makes two broad claims. First, that readers' comments in response to the Fort Hood shootings constitute messages about American national identity, particularly American exceptionalism vis-a-vis the military - the military-idea, the symbol of a unified, coherent force is central to the myth of American exceptionalism. Second, events considered to be failures of the military threaten the coherence of American exceptionalism (by fracturing the military-idea). The Fort Hood incident was considered such a failure and one readers identified as part of a larger problematic involving the US's post-9/11 'war on terror'. In this mediated activity, readers put various discourses (e.g. Islamophobia, mental illness) into service to account for the military's failure and thus maintain the myth of American exceptionalism. Ultimately, these communications constitute an attempt to avoid the divisive consequences of 'another Vietnam', to which the US's post-9/11 military operations are increasingly compared.

T1  - Respect Your Enemies: Orientations Towards Political Opponents and Political Involvement in Britain
AN  - 1347785675; 201319770
AB  - Mainstream liberal democratic theory has primarily emphasized competition as they driving force that ensures the viability of democratic governance. As political parties and candidates compete for electoral majorities, it is believed that the best leaders and the best policy proposals will eventually prevail (Downs, 1957; Schumpeter, 1954). However, conflict and competition may turn into a destructive force that threatens the collective foundation on which democracy depends. In order to distinguish themselves from their political competitors, political parties tend to emphasize differences and underplay areas of collaboration (Bogdanor & Butler, 1983). Driven by a commercialized and conflict-hungry media, politics, especially during election time, has turned into a battlefield that leaves little space for public deliberation (Swanson & Mancini, 1996). Indeed, attacks, insults, and mudslinging have become marked features of elections campaigns in the United Kingdom and the United States where "winner-takes-all" electoral systems further contribute to a generally antagonistic political climate (Ansolabehere & Iyengar, 1995; King, 2006). The emphasis on competition might also affect the way in which ordinary citizens understand the democratic process. In a political environment where politics is about winning -- elections, poll rating, arguments -- a political opponent might be regarded as an enemy rather than a fellow citizen, and the arguments of the other side might be dismissed without serious consideration. Such an orientation "might jeopardize the willingness to accept opposition, and could cause electoral decisions to be rejected or dispensed with altogether" (Almond & Verba, 1963, p. 85).

T1  - The depiction of Polish migrants in the United Kingdom by the British press after Poland's accession to the European Union
AN  - 1347784097; 201322193
AB  - Purpose -- A negative framing of immigrants to stir populist sentiment is a widespread tactic repeatedly deployed by the British press. Following the accession of ten new and predominantly Eastern European member-states to the European Union in 2004, this gambit was again utilised to provocatively portray migrant workers newly arriving in the United Kingdom as an external economic threat. The aim of this paper was to uncover the recurrent ways in which Polish migrants were emotively framed by the top daily British newspapers during this period of EU enlargement. Design/methodology/approach -- A bespoke collection of newspaper articles was assembled and examined using a corpus-based discourse analysis. The analysis was subsequently triangulated with relevant responses to a series of public opinion surveys. Findings -- Results show that the British press conformed to classic media representations of migrants when referring to Poles in particular, by depicting them as an external economic threat "flooding" the country; in addition a novel stereotype of the "Polish plumber" was used to present them arriving to take the jobs of native manual labourers. Originality/value -- The study adds to the understanding of media attitudes towards new migrants in the UK, and demonstrates the utility of triangulated corpus-based discourse analysis for those who seek to highlight systematic characterisations of migrants in the popular press.

T1  - Public Intellectuals and Think Tanks: A Free Market in Ideas?
AN  - 1347784870; 201320155
AB  - The paper critically evaluates the thesis of the interchangeability between the think-tank public intellectual and the academic public intellectual. It suggests that this thesis, while endorsing the rise of the think-tank public intellectual, pronounces the salience of the intellectual-social critic and undermines the authority of academic public intellectuals. It is argued that the think-tank expert doubling as the public intellectuals could limit the political relevance of the academic public intellectual and that the think-tank expert's monopolization of the public forum could present a threat to the quality of public debates. While recognizing that there are many contradictions inherent in the role of intellectual and that there are now numerous factors that hinder the abilities of academics to act as public intellectuals, the paper emphasizes public academic intellectuals' contribution to the dynamics of public opinion and the quality of democratic standards. In today's context, with the omnipresent of media, the new conditions of knowledge production, the neo-liberal ethos and the social prominence of think-tank experts, the sources of the academic public intellectual authority are in a continuous need for reinvestment.

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons
AN  - 1364703922; 201327807
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The subtle nature of Facebook politics: Swedish social network site users and political participation
AN  - 1283639458; 201304305
AB  - Sweden, with a high level of political participation and an avant-garde position regarding internet access, broadband and social media penetration in the population, is a critical case for studying social media in relation to political participation. Three types of users -- members of political parties, members of interest organizations, and non-members -- are interviewed in focus groups about their attitudes to political content in the social network site Facebook. The discussions show that although practices and attitudes vary, using social network sites alone does not drive previously inactive respondents to political participation. Respondents who are members of interest organizations view social network sites as valuable tools for participation, whereas respondents who are not refrain from sharing political views with their friends. They are exposed to political content and requests for participation, but prefer generally to remain passive. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Understanding and addressing the stigma of mental illness with ethnic minority communities
AN  - 1313192774
AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness.

T1  - A Two-Year Panel Study among Belgian Late Adolescents on the Impact of School Environment Characteristics on Political Trust
AN  - 1125221006; 201241147
AB  - Trust in political institutions can be considered as an important prerequisite for the stability of democratic political systems. Opinions differ, however, on how this attitude is shaped. Research among adolescents suggests that this age group already has quite stable levels of political trust, even before they have had first-hand experiences with the functioning of political systems. Building on a two-year panel study among Belgian adolescents (n = 3,632), we investigate the development of political trust between the ages of 16 and 18 years. As was already predicted by functionalist authors, experiences with an open classroom climate have strong and persistent positive effects on political trust, and this effect proves to be much stronger than the one from direct civic education classes. The information function of mass media and academic aspirations, too, have a strong effect on political trust. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "Why Can't You Control Yourself?" Fat Should Be a Feminist Issue
AN  - 958726616
AB  - This article is a comment on Fikkan and Rothblum's (2011) article "Is Fat a Feminist Issue? Exploring the Gendered Nature of Weight Bias." They argued that fat women in North America experience significantly more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do, marshaled evidence to support their argument in several domains (e.g., employment, education, romantic relationships, health care, the media), and wondered why feminist scholars have not paid much attention to the oppression of fat women. Here I suggest several reasons why fat women experience more prejudice and discrimination than fat men do: the objectification of women, gender-related aspects of health behavior and knowledge about health and illness, and the importance of self-control to the performance of femininity. I also suggest that there is some overlap in negative stereotypes of both feminists and fat women, which might lead to a desire to distance oneself from both. However, feminists should recognize the intersectionality of fat oppression and the way it colludes with the sexualization and objectification of women in popular culture. Thus, fat should be a feminist issue.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Internalized Sexual Minority Stressors and Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 1030864651; 201230056
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious problem in both same-sex and heterosexual relationships. Although there are numerous similarities in the dynamics of IPV, gay men and lesbians experience unique stressors related to their sexual minority status. This preliminary, descriptive study examined the relationship among internalized homophobia, stigma consciousness, and openness to self-reported IPV victimization and perpetration. Among 581 men and lesbians, approximately one-quarter reported IPV victimization and almost 10% reported IPV perpetration. When demographic variables of age, sex of participant, and relationship status were controlled, victims of IPV reported greater expectations of prejudice and discrimination, yet were more open about their sexual orientation. Similarly, expectations of prejudice and discrimination were related to IPV perpetration. As researchers and counselors focus on understanding, and ultimately reducing, same-sex IPV, it is imperative that sexual minority stressors are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nontraditional News Negativity: The Relationship of Entertaining Political News Use to Political Cynicism and Mistrust
AN  - 964189258; 201208168
AB  - Although past research suggested that entertainment viewing may weaken political trust, only a few studies have investigated this outcome for specific types of nontraditional news shows. This study examines the relationship between exposure to three forms of nontraditional news that merge entertainment with informational content-comedy talk shows, satirical news, and cable opinion news-and political mistrust and cynicism. Using data from a national survey (n = 777) conducted in the United States, findings indicate that viewing satirical news programs appeared to be related to systemic cynicism, while exposure to all three shows was either directly or indirectly associated with distrust in politicians. Mistrust in the news media, on the other hand, appeared for comedy talk shows and satirical news use only in particular contexts. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 919900855; 201202146
AB  - This paper explores how citizen-users think and communicate about public opinion polling through an analysis of tweets published during and just after the 2010 UK General Election leaders' debate broadcast on Sky News on 22 April 2010, the second of three debates. For those who comment on events in real time through social media such as Twitter, a category we call the 'viewertariat', this event was notable for Sky News's immediate coverage of a YouGov poll that seemed discrepant. Indeed, within an hour of the end of the debate, various mainstream media published a number of polls apparently at odds with each other. Such discrepancies opened a space for lay theories to emerge about relationships between political parties, media, polling firms, and the wider public itself. Individuals were pushed to find explanations and quick to publish them in a public assembly of views. Analysis of these data illuminates not just what people think, but how they think about long-term concerns of scholars and practitioners of politics and political communication, such as credibility, trust and power, and how citizens manage expectations during events where the outcome is uncertain. Accounting for viewertariat behaviour develops recent research on mediatized politics in important ways. First, we find some viewertariat members performing a lay tutelage role, providing information and explanations about polling and elections to fellow citizens who express confusion. This indicates the continued importance of informed public discussion to some citizens. Second, we find a blurring of elite/non-elite interactions alongside persistent theories about elite conspiracies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "We'd Be Free": Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or Sexism
AN  - 1221412117; 201245930
AB  - Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities.

T1  - The shaping of Islam and Islam ophobia in Belgium
AN  - 881320861
AB  - The author discusses the way in which Islam has been cast as a political problem in Belgium and how Muslims have, particularly in Flanders, become framed by politicians and commentators in the media as a threat. The actual socioeconomic difficulties that Muslims (particularly those of Turkish and Moroccan descent) face are being redrawn as problems stemming from their culture and religion. State agencies are trying to shape the political organisation that will represent Belgian Muslims, as the issue of Islam is increasingly debated in terms of the 'clash of civilisations', and secularism and the Enlightenment are linked in public debate with a Christian Europe.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 872845523
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Simon Cowell for prime minister'? Young citizens' attitudes towards celebrity politics
AN  - 1928294158
AB  - The merging of celebrity and politics is becoming an established element of democratic political culture. Drawing on our own empirical research with first-time voters in the UK, we want to contribute to this debate. Specifically we ask whether, for young citizens, celebrities are an alternative to current political processes and a democratizing force capable of engaging them in the politics of the public sphere. Young people are a particularly interesting example. While disconnected from main-stream forms of political participation, such as voting and party membership (Fahmy, 2003), young people’s lives are strongly connected with the cultural industries that drive the production of celebrity. Our argument engages with those authors who suggest that popular culture has the potential to energize the public sphere.

T1  - Cell-Phone-Only Households And Problems Of Differential Nonresponse Using An Address-Based Sampling Design
AN  - 964200321; 201208174
AB  - Identifying and contacting cell-phone-only (CPO) households in an efficient and cost-effective manner is critical for many studies to ensure the representativeness of final survey estimates. With the advent of address-based sampling (ABS)-that is, the sampling of addresses from a database with near universal coverage of residential households-researchers have an alternative to cell-phone frame sampling for identifying and surveying these households. Using a large ABS mixed-mode study, we explore three key questions. First, how effective is an ABS design in identifying CPO households? Second, is there significant differential response across the "matched" (address and telephone number) and "unmatched" (address only) portions of the sample, given that CPO households are nearly all found within the "unmatched" sample where first contact is limited to mail only? Third, can traditional sex-age-race/ethnicity post-stratification reduce potential bias due to differential nonresponse or are additional measures required? For this latter question, we examine the potential biasing impact of differential nonresponse where CPO homes are shown to be significantly different in attitudes and behaviors from the more prevalent homes that have both landline and cell-phone access. Data come from a study of 87,034 Nielsen Radio Audience Measurement adult respondents conducted in spring 2009. The study shows that, while CPO homes can be reached and interviewed using an ABS design, it is important to assess and correct for the potential biasing effects of differential nonresponse.

T1  - People's perceptions of HIV/AIDS as portrayed by their labels of the disease: the case of Botswana
AN  - 1429627563; 201338399
AB  - It is typical of societies to come up with their own labels or names to any phenomenon that may befall them in the course of their life time. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been no exception to this practice. In Botswana most of these labels are either in Setswana or English whereby an Eglish expression is simply adopted and used to refer to HIV/ AIDS. This study looks at the different labels or names that have been used to refer to HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It is an attempt to provide insights into perceptions of HIV/AIDS by the local communities portrayed through the naming of this disease. The study demonstrates how, through the different labels, the local communities started in denial distancing themselves from this disease and in some cases associating AIDS with ailments already known to them, cultural practices and taboos. Some of these labels further demonstrate the negative attitudes that may have fuelled HIV-related stigma in the country. Based on the informants' responses, the paper further attempts a categorisation of these labels influenced by different attitudes to HIV/AIDS, some of which are self-perpetuating and may continue to be a hindrance to the fight against the disease.

T1  - America, America: National Identity, Presidential Debates, and National Mood
AN  - 1364700464; 201324727
AB  - In their public messages, United States politicians often invoke America in an attempt to unite citizens and build electoral coalitions. Such an emphasis is particularly common in presidential debates, which are climactic "media events" late in campaigns for the White House, when candidates take questions from journalists and citizens while addressing millions of voters. We analyzed the connection between (a) candidates' highlighting of national identity in presidential debates and (b) mass public opinion since 1960. We expected and found that (a) candidates increased their emphasis on the nation during times of heightened national uncertainty, (b) Democratic presidential candidates invoked the nation more often than Republican candidates, and (c) comparisons across elections among incumbents suggest that national uncertainty was more important than partisan identity in eliciting invocations of the nation.

T1  - Catholics and the Death Penalty: Religion as a Filter for Political Beliefs
AN  - 1346933351
AB  - Research has shown that public opinion about the death penalty can be largely attributed to the tone of media stories and the number of murders that happen around the time the surveys are conducted. However, not all citizens react similarly to new information such as media stories. Political awareness can help people to filter out new information that might otherwise sway their opinions. Those who lack such awareness are more easily persuaded by new information, resulting in rather unstable, easily changed opinions. We hypothesize that strongly held religious beliefs also serve as such a filter, creating stability in opinions regardless of political awareness. Using the issue of capital punishment, we examine how strongly held Catholic beliefs might affect opinions on the death penalty. We show that Catholics with a strong religious attachment are less likely to be persuaded by current events and political discussion than is the norm. Strongly religious Catholics tend to filter out such information and seemingly ground their opinions in the social doctrine of their church.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Materialism, Postmaterialism and Agenda-Setting Effects: The Values-Issues Consistency Hypothesis
AN  - 1018352525; 201213364
AB  - This article examines the moderating role of human values on agenda-setting effects, which refer to the influence of news coverage on defining the public agenda. The results of two studies -- a content analysis of Canadian newspapers matched with a representative survey panel of Canadian voters, in addition to an experiment with college students -- find support for the hypothesis that agenda-setting effects are stronger when the topics in the news agenda are consistent with individuals' values. Individuals with materialist values exhibited larger agenda-setting effects for materialist issues than for postmaterialist issues, whereas postmaterialist individuals exhibited larger agenda-setting effects for postmaterialist issues than for materialist issues. These findings bring new evidence to debates on the psychological process of agenda setting and the ability of individuals to resist news media influence. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigration in the 2008 Virginia presidential election: A cultural issue remains puissant despite an economic crisis
AN  - 754048532; 201054353
AB  - In 2006 and 2007, many analysts expected that immigration would be one of the top domestic issues in the 2008 campaign. However, in the 2008 presidential general election, immigration issues were never a major topic between candidates John McCain and Barack Obama. This was partially because McCain has more moderate views toward immigration reform than the passionate anti-immigration faction of the Republican Party. Prior research suggests that an issue in a presidential campaign can remain influential even when the media and campaigns are not discussing or addressing the issue, even when the candidates or parties do not differ greatly on the issue. In a survey of Virginia residents conducted just before the November election, immigration attitudes were a differential factor between McCain and Obama. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - "Roots" or the virtualities of racial imaginaries in Puerto Rico and the diaspora
AN  - 748323907
AB  - This essay analyzes representations and imaginaries of blackness in contemporary Puerto Rico, by focusing on the debates raised by "Raíces"/(Roots) (2001), the Banco Popular video special about traditional Afro-Puerto Rican rhythms of bomba and plena. These debates divided public opinion in Puerto Rico and included members of academia, musicologists, bomba and plena groups, and the San Antón (Ponce) community residents. They refer to the ways Puerto Ricans "speak the unspoken," that is, the ways Puerto Ricans talk about race and its intersectionalities on the island and in the diaspora. Authenticity claims, particularly as to why bomba and plena appeared alongside reggae or hip-hop, are discussed in terms of four important elements: (1) the musical, cultural and social discourses of blackness in Puerto Rico and the ways they are represented in the media; (2) the complex dialogues between Puerto Rican definitions of blackness/whiteness and the African Diaspora; (3) forms of racialization of the Puerto Rican diaspora; and (4) the ways roots are also routes that articulate an understanding of blackness, race, and racialization in contemporary Caribbean/US global circuits.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 743057741; 201043757
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

T1  - Western Views Toward Muslims: Evidence from a 2006 Cross-National Survey
AN  - 743047117; 201032538
AB  - Concerns about Islamic extremism and ongoing debates about the integration and assimilation of Muslims into Western societies continue to attract considerable attention from the media, policymakers, and scholars, but relatively little cross-national research has been done on Western attitudes toward Muslims. This article attempts to address this question by exploring 2006 Pew Global Attitudes data among non-Muslims in Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and the U.S. Using structural equation modeling, we examine the determinants of Western views toward Muslims, and find that threat perceptions are the primary factor influencing these views. Specifically, our analysis suggests that perceptions of security threats drive attitudes regarding Muslims, and that perceived cultural threats are only indirectly related to views towards Muslims.

T1  - Till Death Us Do Part and the BBC: Racial Politics and the British Working Classes 1965-75
AN  - 1978060690
AB  - Historians have struggled to unpick the complex relationship between the British working classes and heightened Commonwealth immigration to postwar Britain and have tended to explain the development of racial politics in this period in terms of the agenda of the Conservative Party and broader forces of the political right. Within this historical analysis, Labour's position has been less clear. This article argues that an analysis of Johnny Speight's BBC comedy series Till Death Us Do Part informs historical discussion about changing racial sensibilities within the Labour Party and its working-class constituencies.Till Death Us Do Part was one of the most popular and controversial programmes of its generation. The story focused on the working-class Garnett family and specifically on the anti-hero Alf Garnett, played by Warren Mitchell. Speight claimed that he utilized this character to explode popular prejudices and attack the British class system. Whilst the relationship between Speight and his character was somewhat more complicated, this article argues that Till Death Us Do Part does offer critical insight into the political and social dynamics of the British working classes and ultimately can enhance historical understanding of British race relations in this period.

T1  - There's More Than Meets the Eye: Facial Appearance and Evaluations of Transsexual People
AN  - 743062461; 201046015
AB  - Recent events have drawn attention to the prejudice and discrimination faced by transpeople; however, there is limited research on attitudes toward transpeople. We studied the effects of facial appearance on the evaluations of transsexuals in 239 heterosexual undergraduate students from the midwestern United States. Men had significantly more negative evaluations than women. The gender of the transsexual (male-to-female or female-to-male) had limited effects on evaluations; however, the transsexual whose facial appearance was congruent with their desired gender was perceived as more attractive than the transsexual whose facial appearance was incongruent. Negative evaluations were correlated with higher levels of transphobia and sexual prejudice. Further investigation is needed on the factors that influence prejudicial attitudes toward transpeople, including physical appearance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Same Game, Different Rules? Gender Differences in Political Participation
AN  - 743061198; 201045993
AB  - We investigate gender gaps in political participation with 2004 ISSP data for 18 advanced Western democracies (N: 20,359) using linear and logistic regression models. Controlling for socio-economic characteristics and political attitudes reveals that women are more likely than men to have voted and engaged in 'private' activism, while men are more likely to have engaged in direct contact, collective types of actions and be (more active) members of political parties. Our analysis indicates that demographic and attitudinal characteristics influence participation differently among men and among women, as well as across types of participation. These results highlight the need to move toward a view of women engaging in differing types of participation and based on different characteristics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Changing Face of Racial Discrimination: Hispanics as the Dominant Minority in the USA - a New Application of Power-Threat Theory
AN  - 743055325; 201031722
AB  - According to Hubert Blalock's 1967 power-threat theory, the larger the minority group's size the greater the threat to the majority group. Most of Blalock's examples, and much of the subsequent empirical investigation into the power-threat thesis, focus on Anglo and African American relations. Changing demographics will likely alter existing majority-minority relations as Hispanics displace African Americans as the largest minority. This will change the face of racial discrimination in the country. Indeed, this paper suggests that the animosity toward Latinos by both the majority white and minority black populations may be more intense than those shaping contemporary white-black relations. Two key lifestyle features that have not contaminated black-white relations may exacerbate hostility toward Hispanics: their perceived illegal status in the country, and the perception that Hispanics resist learning English. The role of the media in perpetuating these stereotypes and inflaming hostility toward Latinos is also discussed. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]
