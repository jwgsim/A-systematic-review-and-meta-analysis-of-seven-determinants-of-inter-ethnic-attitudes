T1  - The burden of being certain: National identity certainty predicts support for COVID‐Related restrictive measures and outgroup conspiracy beliefs
AN  - 2673616614
AB  - In dealing with the COVID‐19 pandemic, government officials often encounter two concurrent concerns: they have to enforce necessary public health and safety measures to manage COVID‐19. Meanwhile, they also have to mitigate conspiracy beliefs about COVID‐19. To shed light on these issues, we conducted two studies to investigate national identity certainty (i.e., the extent to which people are certain about their national identity) as a predictor of (a) support for restrictive measures to curtail COVID‐19 and (b) conspiracy beliefs about an outgroup as the culprit of COVID‐19. Study 1 was a three‐week longitudinal study (N = 301) where we investigated the relationships both on a between‐person level (differences between individuals) and on a within‐person level (week‐by‐week fluctuations of the same individual). We found that individual differences in national identity certainty predicted increased support for restrictive measures and increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs. These relationships emerged, even when we controlled for national identity positivity, that is, the extent to which people see their national identity in positive light. In Study 2 (N = 316), we used a cross‐sectional correlational design and replicated the findings of Study 1. Moreover, we found that the relationships were explained by distinct threat perceptions: realistic threat explained the increased support for restrictive measures, whereas symbolic threat explained the increased outgroup conspiracy beliefs. Overall, our findings suggest that support for restrictive measures and outgroup conspiracy beliefs can be seen as attempts of people high in national identity certainty to address the distinct threats of COVID‐19.

T1  - First Comes Marriage, Then Comes the Election: Macro-level Event Impacts on African American, Latina/x, and White Sexual Minority Women
AN  - 2476486477
AB  - IntroductionSexual minority women (SMW) may have different experiences of macro-level events, such as changes in marriage laws or election outcomes, related to their multiple identities. African American, Latina/x, and White identities intersect with gender/sex and sexual identity to influence experiences at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, social, and political levels of the socio-ecological environment.MethodsParticipants include 100 African American, 35 Latina/x, and 164 White SMW (N = 299) in wave 4 (2017–2019) of a longitudinal study of SMW’s health conducted in the USA (Chicago Health and Life Experiences of Women Study). Responses to nine open-ended survey questions about marriage equality and the 2016 Presidential election were examined.ResultsThematic analysis noted similarities across groups and focused on group differences in four areas: (1) personal well-being (including fear and anxiety about discrimination; risk associated with masculine presentation; and religion as stress and support); (2) interpersonal relationships (including relationships with partners, family, and in a community); (3) societal discrimination and prejudice (including harassment in public spaces and concerns about travel); and (4) civil rights, government harassment, and police-state violence.ConclusionsEmerging differences emphasized the impact of race/ethnicity and the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender on experiences of marriage equality and the 2016 election.Policy ImplicationsFindings suggest that a more nuanced understanding of the experiences of individuals with different racial/racialized identities and the intersection of race/ethnicity with sexual identities is essential to creating culturally competent and effective supports for SMW.

T1  - The Queen’s Loyal ‘Others’ –the Metropolitan Jewish and Catholic Hierarchies, the Communal Press and the Diamond Jubilee of 1897
AN  - 2536150077
AB  - This article examines the Jewish and Catholic experience of acceptance, rejection and discrimination in late nineteenth-century Britain through the lens of the celebrations of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee in the summer of 1897. Arguing that the Anglo-Jewish and English Catholic hierarchical discourses created at the time of the Jubilee reveal the continuing profound insecurities felt by the minority leaderships, the article will dissect the various ‘stories’ created around the events of the Jubilee, particularly in London. It will consider in turn how narratives were created stressing Victoria’s personal role of liberator; how a premium was placed by the hierarchies on the different demographic strands of the minority communities behaving in aropriate ‘English’ class roles; and how this narrative was complicated – first by Irish nationalism and migrant Jewish radicalism, and secondly by the prejudices of the wider British establishment. Ultimately it will contend that the events of the Jubilee revealed a continued exclusion of Jewish and Catholic groups from the British ruling class, and that anti-Catholic sectarianism and antisemitism was not solely a matter of economic discrimination and physical violence against working-class communities, but also subtler forms of prejudice against more prosperous Jews and Catholics.

T1  - Minority Stress in Older Portuguese Gay and Bisexual Men and Its Impact on Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction
AN  - 2188816548
AB  - By 2050, the elderly population is expected to represent more than one third of the Portuguese population. Previous research demonstrated a significant increase of the LGB population in this age group, and that the needs of these individuals are not being addressed. Elderly LGB people, as both a sexual minority and an older age cohort, are particularly vulnerable to double stigma. The aim of this study was to evaluate how minority status of gay/bisexual men and its association with other psychosocial variables may affect sexual and relationship satisfaction. The sample was recruited online and composed of 110 gay/bisexual men aged 60 years or older (M = 63.5; SD = 3.41). Regression analyses showed that both the concealment of sexual identity in recent years and self-stigma significantly affected sexual and relationship satisfaction. In contrast, age-related discrimination was not associated with sexual satisfaction or relationship satisfaction. Gay and bisexual elderly men in this study tended to maintain their sexual identity hidden from others, possibly due to a lack of openness of the Portuguese society to accept homoaffective behavior. Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - "Light-skinned people always win": An Autoethnography of Colorism in a Mother–Daughter Relationship
AN  - 2491989775
AB  - Meghan Burke defines colorism as "the allocation of privilege and disadvantage according to the lightness or darkness of one's skin" (International Encyclopedia of the Social Social Sciences, 2nd ed.). The intraracial practice can be heightened in familial interactions. This collaborative autoethnography utilizes Alice Walker's framework of womanism to explore the narratives of colorism in a mother-daughter relationship when the two do not share the same skin hue. Womanism instructs us to break our silence around practices that denigrate us and seek ways to survive and thrive in our blackness. Four specific incidents experienced by my adolescent daughter are shared to critique colorism and consider strategies for navigating this practice and sustaining a mother-daughter relationship.

T1  - Who Goes to Shows? Race-ethnicity and the Visual and Performing Arts
AN  - 2375721987
AB  - Using data from the 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, I investigate whether education’s influence on the likelihood of visual and performing arts attendance in the USA varies by race-ethnicity. The results reveal that education increases the odds of attendance for both Whites and non-Whites, but it has a stronger impact upon the former than the latter. Unlike Whites, education’s effect on attending visual and performing arts activities for non-Whites is insignificant for high school diploma recipients when compared to their counterparts with some college education.These findings suggest a racial-ethnic bias in visual and performing arts attendance net of education that connects to the European roots of “legitimate” art in modern western society and the history of US racial discrimination. European Americans have dominated the USA’s social institutions for centuries and have held prejudices against minorities’ artistic capabilities since the colonial era. Consequentially, they could determine which arts genres provide valuable cultural capital. Conversely, minority art communities have only recently acquired the resources for self-sustainability. This likely limited their ability to develop formal institutions within their own communities to support the arts.

T1  - Identification with the American South and Anti-Muslim Attitudes
AN  - 2353195013
AB  - The number of anti-Muslim hate groups in the U.S. nearly tripled between 2015 and 2016. In addition, the number of hate crimes committed against members of the religion jumped 67% in 2015 alone. Addressing the rise in anti-Muslim prejudice is critical. We examined (N = 406) the role of regional identification in predicting anti-Muslim attitudes. That is, identification with the American South, a more conservative and religious part of the country with a history of slavery and violent secession movements, predicted anti-Muslim attitudes. This relationship was mediated by conservation values. For Southerners who strongly identified with “the South”, the endorsement of values related to a general resistance to change led to greater anti-Muslim attitudes. Anti-Muslim bias may lie in perceptions of threat: for strongly identified Southerners, the Muslim faith is viewed as a societal threat.

T1  - The split Arab/Jew figure revisited
AN  - 2424461725
AB  - In this essay, Shohat argues that the question of the Arab-Jew, in contrast to present-day ethnonationalist common sense, must be rearticulated as mutually constitutive categories, so as to address the complex imaginaries of both ‘the Arab’ and ‘the Jew’. Elaborating on her earlier dialogue with Edward Said’s account of the bifurcated Oriental/Semitic myth—one rendered as the Orientalist (the Jew) and the other as the Oriental (the Arab)—Shohat offers a genealogical reading of this gradual splitting, locating it prior to the partition of Palestine and even to the emergence of Zionism, and tracing it back to the dissemination of a colonial-inflected Enlightenment discourse. More crucially, Shohat asks where the indigenous Jew of ‘the Orient’, and more specifically the Arab-Jew, might fit conceptually within this split. Today, with the epic-scale reconceptualization of belonging in the wake of partition, diasporization and competing nationalist imaginaries, the Arab-Jew figure silently occupies an ambiguous position within the bifurcation. Yet a critical analysis of the Orientalist splitting that sidesteps the question of the Arab-Jew risks reproducing the fixed ethnonationalist lexicon that posits Jewishness and Arabness as irreconcilable. At the same time, this very ambiguity, Shohat argues, was already fomented with the imperial ‘translation’ of the Enlightenment project into a racialized idiom, now applied differentially to the Muslim and the Jew-within-the-Orient. This essay traces such representational ruptures back to the nineteenth century, examining various instances of what the essay regards as ‘the de-indigenization of the Arab-Jew’. To illustrate her thesis, Shohat examines the gendered imagining of both Jewish and Muslim communities within a relational and transnational comparative framework. Orientalist tropes such as the odalisque, the hammam and the un/veiled female had long been projected on to Muslim and Jewish women throughout the region but, with the emergence of imperial ‘minorities’ discourse, the exoticized Jew-in-the-Orient became the object of a gendered rescue phantasy, as vividly illustrated in Dehodencq’s painting L’Exécution de la juive. Rather than a document of Muslim antisemitism, however, the colonial visual archive inadvertently registers what Shohat defines as a ‘split-within-the split’, highlighting the novel formation of an ambivalent indigeneity for Arab-Jews within ‘the Orient’. Yet the aesthetic dispositions also inadvertently and paradoxically reveal an underlying, thoroughly syncretic and shared Judaeo-Muslim cultural geography. Here the pivotal figure of the Arab-Jew reveals an intricate landscape of belonging that offers an alternative conceptual framework in which to discuss the ruptures prior to the grand rupture of partition, and to illuminate the post/colonial transformation that dramatically impacted the narrative of Jewish at-homeness within Muslim spaces.

T1  - How Gender and Race Stereotypes Impact the Advancement of Scholars in STEM: Professors’ Biased Evaluations of Physics and Biology Post-Doctoral Candidates
AN  - 2234287652
AB  - The current study examines how intersecting stereotypes about gender and race influence faculty perceptions of post-doctoral candidates in STEM fields in the United States. Using a fully-crossed, between-subjects experimental design, biology and physics professors (n = 251) from eight large, public, U.S. research universities were asked to read one of eight identical curriculum vitae (CVs) depicting a hypothetical doctoral graduate applying for a post-doctoral position in their field, and rate them for competence, hireability, and likeability. The candidate’s name on the CV was used to manipulate race (Asian, Black, Latinx, and White) and gender (female or male), with all other aspects of the CV held constant across conditions. Faculty in physics exhibited a gender bias favoring the male candidates as more competent and more hirable than the otherwise identical female candidates. Further, physics faculty rated Asian and White candidates as more competent and hirable than Black and Latinx candidates, while those in biology rated Asian candidates as more competent and hirable than Black candidates, and as more hireable than Latinx candidates. An interaction between candidate gender and race emerged for those in physics, whereby Black women and Latinx women and men candidates were rated the lowest in hireability compared to all others. Women were rated more likeable than men candidates across departments. Our results highlight how understanding the underrepresentation of women and racial minorities in STEM requires examining both racial and gender biases as well as how they intersect.

T1  - Articulating language oppression: colonialism, coloniality and the erasure of Tibet's minority languages
AN  - 2316452528
AB  - Roche's article discusses 'language oppression' as a form of domination that is coherent with other forms of oppression along the lines of 'race', nation, colour and ethnicity. Scholars have defined language oppression as the 'enforcement of language loss by physical, mental, social and spiritual coercion'. It is part of an evolving suite of concepts from linguistics, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology that examines issues of language discrimination, or 'linguicism'. Roche explores one aspect of linguicism-language erasure-and how it relates to language oppression, focusing on Tibetans in the People's Republic of China (PRC). He examines how language oppression is produced through practices of erasure: the ways in which certain populations and their languages are systematically rendered discursively invisible. He argues that the erasure of certain languages in the Tibetan context is systematically reproduced by two otherwise opposed political projects: the colonial project of the PRC state; and the international Tibet movement that seeks to resist it. He refers to the contingent cooperation between these two opposed projects as 'articulated oppression'. In concluding the article he examines how the disarticulation of this oppression is a necessary condition for the emancipation of Tibet's minority languages, and discusses the broader significance of this study for understanding language oppression, and its relation to other forms of oppression.

T1  - People systematically update moral judgments of blame
AN  - 2183621328
AB  - Six experiments examine people’s updating of blame judgments and test predictions developed from a socially regulated blame perspective. According to this perspective, blame emerged in human history as a socially costly tool for regulating other’s behavior. Because it is costly for both blamers and violators, blame is typically constrained by requirements for “warrant”-evidence that one’s moral judgment is justified. This requirement motivates people to systematically process available causal and mental information surrounding a violation. That is, people are relatively calibrated and evenhanded in utilizing evidence that either amplifies or mitigates blame. Such systematic processing should be particularly visible when people update their moral judgments. Using a novel experimental paradigm, we test 2 sets of predictions derived from the socially regulated blame perspective and compare them with predictions from a motivated-blame perspective. Studies 1–4 demonstrate (across student, Internet, and community samples) that moral perceivers systematically grade updated blame judgments in response to the strength of new causal and mental information, without anchoring on initial evaluations. Further, these studies reveal that perceivers update blame judgments symmetrically in response to exacerbating and mitigating information, inconsistent with motivated-blame predictions. Study 5 shows that graded and symmetric blame updating is robust under cognitive load. Lastly, Study 6 demonstrates that biases can emerge once the social requirement for warrant is relaxed-as in the case of judging outgroup members. We conclude that social constraints on blame judgments render the normal process of blame well calibrated to causal and mental information, and biases may appear when such constraints are absent.

T1  - How does intergroup threat affect the shifting function? The moderating role of group identification
AN  - 2274268149
AB  - In this study we examined whether the shifting function can be modulated by intergroup threat, and if so, how this works. We conducted 2 experiments, using a task-switching paradigm, the results of which provide converging evidence that intergroup threat can impair the shifting function. Results showed that participants in the threat condition in each study (Study 1 symbolic threat: n = 29; Study 2 realistic threat: n = 29) experienced greater shifting costs than did those in the control condition (Study 1: n = 29; Study 2: n = 28). Further, group identification moderated the depletion effect in the intergroup threat condition, with participants closer (vs. less close) in group identification showing greater switching costs following the intergroup threat intervention. In sum, these results suggest that intergroup threat could deplete switching ability, and this effect could be influenced by group identification. In future studies researchers should investigate more kinds of intergroup threat than those we used in this study to assess the generalizability of our findings.

T1  - Examining Discrimination against Women, non-Han Minorities, Intellectuals, and non-Communist Members among the Current China's Provincial Political Elites
AN  - 2025298334
AB  - Drawing on a new biographical database of the current provincial leaders, this article aims to test the hypothesis whether women, non-Han minorities, intellectuals, and non-Communist members are discriminated against in the Chinese political sphere. Our findings indicate that women, despite being underrepresented in leadership positions, do not suffer from discrimination in obtaining chief positions, after controlling for their capability related variables. Non-Communist members are still facing the glass ceiling, preventing their rise to the top of China's power structure, while at the same time being underrepresented in leadership positions. However, there is no evidence showing that intellectuals (i.e., doctoral degree holders) and non-Han minorities are suffering from underrepresentation, inequality, and discrimination. Further analysis indicates that traditional prejudice, discriminatory rule manipulation, and no well-defined and legally binding quotas are fundamental causes contributing to women's underrepresentation in power structure and non-Communist members' political discrimination.

T1  - 'The most ardent pro-Israel party': pro-Israel attitudes and anti-antisemitism among populist radical-right parties in Europe
AN  - 1973043896
AB  - Since the turn of the millennium a growing number of European populist radical-right parties have taken to criticizing antisemitism and embracing Israel's cause in its conflict with the Palestinians. This development raises the question of whether, for the first time in European history, we are confronting radical-right politics that is not antisemitic. Kahmann's article approaches this recent development on the extreme right-wing spectrum of European parties from an empirical perspective: he analyses the manner in which leading representatives of the Belgian Vlaams Belang (VB), the Sweden Democrats (SD) and the (now-defunct) German party Die Freiheit have articulated their anti-antisemitism and their solidarity with Israel, and the conclusions that are thereby suggested with regard to the underlying image of Jews and Israel. Kahmann's analysis shows that the pro-Israel and anti-antisemitic turn serves primarily as a pretext for fending off Muslim immigrants, which is claimed as a contribution to the security of the Jewish population. Furthermore, it shows that the right-wing ideal of an ethnically homogeneous nation results in the perception of Jews as members of a foreign nation and in the cultivation of stereotyped images of Jews. For these parties, the status of the Jewish population in the respective European states remains therefore precarious: Jews are merely granted the status of a tolerated minority as long as they are not considered to pose any threat to the 'native' culture. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians serves in this context as a convenient screen on which to project the popular right-wing narrative of a battle between the Judaeo-Christian Occident and the Muslim world.

T1  - Moving images of exclusion: Persisting tropes in the filmic representation of European Roma
AN  - 1969943030
AB  - This paper analyses the most prominent tropes in the earliest and most recent filmic representations of Roma. Stereotypical images of Roma abound in many fictional features as well as documentaries, from the representation of Roma as eternal nomads to racially prejudiced depictions of Roma women and the alleged innateness of music to Roma. Because images and modes of representation change over time, the paper juxtaposes the earliest portrayals of Roma with those produced in the last 15 years. The analysis particularly centres on two dominant reoccurring tropes: types of spaces typically occupied by Roma in film, that is the lack of a place or so-called placeless-ness of Roma; the gendered other, or the Roma woman and the culturally and ethnically othered Roma musician. Ultimately, by analysing how these tropes have persisted in varying forms over 100 years, this work points to the filmic imagery that perpetuates antiziganism, but also how the same has changed over the years to offer possible counter-narratives.

T1  - Couple-level Minority Stress: An Examination of Same-sex Couples' Unique Experiences
AN  - 1969814261
AB  - Social stress resulting from stigma, prejudice, and discrimination--"minority stress"--negatively impacts sexual minority individuals' health and relational well-being. The present study examined how being in a same-sex couple can result in exposure to unique minority stressors not accounted for at the individual level. Relationship timeline interviews were conducted with 120 same-sex couples equally distributed across two study sites (Atlanta and San Francisco), gender (male and female), and relationship duration (at least six months but less than three years, at least three years but less than seven years, and seven or more years). Directed content analyses identified 17 unique couple-level minority stressors experienced within nine distinct social contexts. Analyses also revealed experiences of dyadic minority stress processes (stress discrepancies and stress contagion). These findings can be useful in future efforts to better understand and address the cumulative impact of minority stress on relational well-being and individual health.

T1  - Competence matters! Understanding biculturalism in ethnically diverse adolescents
AN  - 1945133902
AB  - The importance of bicultural competence in negotiating diversity was explored longitudinally with 227 bicultural British female adolescents. Bicultural competence predicted social-psychological adaptation and intergroup attitudes. It also mediated the effects of ethnic identity and perceived similarity on acculturation preferences. Implications for research on adolescents growing up with diversity are considered.

T1  - Masculinity and Homophobic Violence in Australia's Recent Past
AN  - 1924798786
AB  - This paper examines a set of research evidence compiled in the last two decades by the author and several of his Australian colleagues to argue that violence directed at gay men, lesbians and transsexuals as 'sexual minorities' has not been wholly distinct from other general forms of male perpetrated violence with a broad range of victims including heterosexual women and other men attacked in general male-on-male violence. It observes that harassment and violence directed against sexual groups have been highly gendered and everyday phenomena and narrow views of homophobic prejudice should be refined in order to appreciate this. Furthermore, reflecting on these research findings indicates these violent acts have been widespread and collective social phenomena built on masculine understandings of a sexual mainstream and subordinate others. By focusing upon the masculine facets of this violence it can be seen that much of this violence has been a hostile response to sexual and gender non-conformity through which male perpetrators have sought to enact, police and reinforce sexual hierarchies and gender boundaries. There is contemporary research uncertainty about the real extent of sexual prejudice and related violence in Australia and similar liberal democratic nations around the globe. Nevertheless, it is evident that this social phenomenon had a key historical role in signaling socially acceptable masculine appearance and behavior.

T1  - Doing ethnicity: Ethnic wordplay amongst youths
AN  - 1926398248
AB  - The article illustrates ethnicity as a social construction by highlighting how students use ethnically based concepts to categorize each other as well as the Other. Although the concepts have ethnic connotations, they are mainly concerned with matters of style and behaviour. They are therefore open, fluid and inclusive because the students can alternate between the categories. The analyses draw on 1 year of fieldwork in two eighth grade classes in which all students have experience of migration within their families.

T1  - The lynching of African Americans in the U.S. South: A review of sociological and historical perspectives
AN  - 1925084077
AB  - Research in sociology and history on the lynching of African Americans by White mobs in the U.S. South around 1900 has in recent decades grown and matured into a substantive research area in its own right. This article has four purposes. The first purpose is to review dominant sociological and historical approaches in the lynching literature. One key feature of this literature is its bifurcation into one strand of social scientific sociological lynching research and one strand of culturalist historical lynching research. As a consequence of this bifurcation, the study of lynching long lacked sustained interdisciplinary dialogue between sociology and history. The second purpose of this article is to review recent sociological studies that attempt to bridge the disjuncture between sociological and historical approaches otherwise characterizing lynching scholarship. The third purpose of this article is to review other recent studies moving sociological lynching scholarship beyond dominant approaches and foci, including investigations of averted lynchings and investigations of the individual-level characteristics that made African Americans more or less vulnerable to White lynch mobs. The last purpose is to suggest how the contributions of lynching research have implications for understanding present-day racial injustices and inequalities.

T1  - Racial Threat, Intergroup Contact, and School Punishment
AN  - 1916897935
AB  - Objectives: 
Drawing on the racial threat and intergroup contact literatures, we explore whether (1) a school's racial or ethnic context increases school suspensions for Black, Hispanic, and White students; (2) intergroup contact among school board members reduces school suspensions for Black, Hispanic, and White students; and (3) a school's racial or ethnic context effects on school suspensions are conditioned by intergroup contact among school board members. 
Method: 
Count-dependent multilevel modeling techniques on school- and district-level measures from a representative sample of Florida middle and high schools. 
Results: 
Larger racial and ethnic student populations within schools increase the likelihood of suspensions for Black and Hispanic students while decreasing suspensions for White students. Further, higher levels of intergroup contact between Black, White, and Hispanic school board members are associated with a lower likelihood of suspensions for all students. Finally, intergroup contact between Black, White, and Hispanic school board members moderates the effects of school racial and ethnic context on school suspensions. 
Conclusions: 
Important factors are associated with school punishment for Black, Hispanic, and White students. Integrated spaces play an important role in decreasing both punishment disparities and punishment severity.

T1  - Prejudice, polyculturalism, and the influence of contact and moral exclusion: A comparison of responses toward LGBI, TI, and refugee groups
AN  - 1916103191
AB  - Prejudice toward marginalized groups is recognized as a complex and harmful social issue. The present study investigates the role of polyculturalism in undermining prejudice toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex people and refugees. A pilot study (N=76) compared participants' prejudice, contact, and moral exclusion toward lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) and transgender or intersex (TI) people. There were differences for three out of four variables; thus, LGB and TI variables were separated in the study proper (N=154). In this study, we investigated moral exclusion and contact (quantity and quality) relating to LGB, TI, and refugee groups as simultaneous mediators of the relationship between polyculturalism and prejudice, while taking into account openness as per previous research. Structural equation modeling indicated that moral exclusion and contact quality acted as mediators between polyculturalism and prejudice for LGB people, TI people, and refugees.

T1  - The Implications of Ethnicity, Gender, Urban-Rural Residence, and Socioeconomic Status for Progress Through School among Children in Nigeria
AN  - 1902060924
AB  - This study examines the role of ethnicity, gender, urban-rural residence, and socioeconomic status on children's progress through school. It also investigates other correlates of progress through school within the categories of ethnicity, gender, urban-rural residence, and socioeconomic status. The study finds ethnic and income gaps in progress through school. In particular, the results show that Hausa-Fulani children and poor children are less likely on average to progress through school than Yoruba children and non-poor children. The preceding results have numerous policy implications. To address the lack of progress through school that arises from late entry, policies must implement early childhood nutrition and food programs. To reduce lack of progress through school among poor children, policy makers must focus on poverty eradication, learning enhancement, and remedial education programs. To address the problem of lack of progress through school among Hausa-Fulani children, it is vital for policies to establish mobile schools, visiting female teachers, and separate school facilities, especially for Hausa-Fulani girls. Results also indicate that work interferes with children's progress through school; particularly among poor children, rural children, and Hausa-Fulani children. To address this problem, policies need to implement educational stipends that are given to the households in which these children belong on the condition that they are released from work-related distractions during school time.

T1  - Is trans-race possible in an era of unsettled identities?
AN  - 1900934824
AB  - Brubaker's book Trans is an important intervention in debates about sexual/gender and racial/ethnic identities in a period of generalized identity unsettlement. It challenges us to think precisely about identities and social categories. Thinking with trans proves to be intellectually productive, showing us the similarities and differences between transgender and trans-race. This contribution to the book symposium raises questions about the specificity of Indigenous identities framed by settler-colonial relations. It also discusses transgender in a global context where non-Western identities have been challenged, and where non-Western protagonists have responded to cultural liberalization at times with forms of gender and sexual repression.

T1  - Identity, causality and social cohesion
AN  - 1884516109
AB  - According to the Identity Thesis, sharing an identity tends to promote social cohesion. The article focuses on two aspects of social cohesion, namely trust and solidarity. It distinguishes between different versions of the Identity Thesis that differ regarding the causal efficacy attributed to specific values and the sharing of values, and with respect to the value sets that may be fed into the thesis (relying on work in political theory on nationalism, liberalism and multiculturalism). Having established the existence of different versions of the thesis, four different accounts of why shared identities could be expected to promote social cohesion are considered and assessed.

T1  - State Repression and Religious Conflict: The Perils of the State Clampdown on the Shi'a Minority in Nigeria
AN  - 1892718918
AB  - In Nigeria, there is an increasing population of the followers of Shi'a Islam, which is largely promoted by the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) led by Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky. Given its anti-state ideology and anarchical conducts, there have been a series of clashes between the Shi'a group and the Nigerian state. Since December 2015, the government both at the national and state levels began a coercive repression of the IMN following a clash that led to the death of over 500 members of the group. This paper analyses the ongoing state repression of the Shi'a Muslims in Nigeria. It argues that the increasingly violent actions by the state against the group are a recipe for a large-scale conflict, which may assume the following dimensions: a new wave of religious terrorism (after Boko Haram), a Sunni-Shi'a conflict, and international proxy wars in Nigeria. The paper concludes that a practicable way to stem the imminent violence is for the government to establish a dialogue with the group on how to ensure its compliance with the state laws and not totally outlaw it.

T1  - The connectivity of ethnic displays: new codes for identity in northern Laos
AN  - 1832906721
AB  - In Laos, cultural festivals and other forms of ethnic display communicate locality and ethnicity to external agencies, in particular the nation state. This article documents strategies of identity-making in a small festival that was staged spontaneously in a Rmeet (Lamet) village. The chosen representations were conventional: dance, music, clothing. The Rmeet thereby employed a festival code used by numerous minorities worldwide. But these recently invented traditions are continuous with earlier representations that addressed various categories of strangers, including historic states and non-state groups. What has changed is the connectivity of the representations. Dance or costume used to represent external relationships in the past, but have been recoded for present use. Moreover, Rmeet have appropriated a New Year's festival invented by the neighboring Khmu. Thus, ethnic displays appear as the most recent way of communicating difference in a code that connects them with the state, neighboring ethnicities, and a global language of locality.

T1  - Social Construction of Ethnic Identity and Conflict: The Cases of the Chechen and the Uighur
AN  - 1850368959
AB  - This paper examines and compares ethnic identities of the Chechen and the Uighur, and their relations with Russia and China, respectively. The Russian-Chechen relationship, which has seen centuries of intense hatred and intolerance, appears to be entering a period of peace and some acceptance. In contrast, the Chinese-Uighur relationship has been mostly begrudgingly stable for a century, but rising tensions in Xinjiang could spell disaster in the years to come. We argue that identities of the Chechen and the Uighur and their interactions and conflict with Russia and China are consequences of historical legacies and social, religious and political forces. Our research supports scholarly arguments that a strong sense of marginalization endured by Muslims and trauma and anger experienced by Chechen and Uighur Muslims all play major roles in the violence and terrorist behavior conducted by both the Chechen and Uighur.

T1  - THE LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF RACIAL/ETHNIC INEQUALITY IN NEIGHBORHOOD AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE, 1990-2009
AN  - 1832315249
AB  - Research examining racial/ethnic disparities in pollution exposure often relies on cross-sectional data. These analyses are largely insensitive to exposure trends and rarely account for broader contextual dynamics. To provide a more comprehensive assessment of racial-environmental inequality over time, we combine the 1990 to 2009 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with spatially- and temporally-resolved measures of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) in respondents' neighborhoods, as well as census data on the characteristics of respondents' metropolitan areas. Results based on multilevel repeated measures models indicate that Blacks and Latinos are, on average, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 than Whites. Despite nationwide declines in levels of pollution over time, racial and ethnic disparities persist and cannot be fully explained by individual-, household-, or metropolitan-level factors.

T1  - Homogeneity and Inequality: School Discipline Inequality and the Role of Racial Composition
AN  - 1819909361
AB  - Research consistently demonstrates that black students are disproportionately subject to behavioral sanctions, yet little is known about contextual variation. This paper explores the relationship between school racial composition and racial inequality in discipline. Prior work suggests that demographic composition predicts harsh punishment of minorities. Accordingly, a threat framework suggests that increases in black student enrollment correspond to increases in punitive school policies. Results from this paper find some support for this hypothesis, finding that the percent of black students in a school is related to increased odds of suspension/expulsion, and differential effects of behavior partially mediate these relationships. However, I also find that a traditional threat narrative may be insufficient. Black students may be most likely to experience unequal sanctions on their behavior in racially homogeneous contexts -- whether homogeneously black or white. These results suggest that more research is needed to understand how the social organization of schools contributes to discipline inequality.

T1  - The Impact of Victimization and Neuroticism on Mental Health in Young Men Who Have Sex with Men: Internalized Homophobia as an Underlying Mechanism
AN  - 1802422313
AB  - Sexual minorities experience greater mental health issues compared with heterosexuals due to minority stressors. This study focused on the impact of victimization and neuroticism on mental health in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and the mediating role of internalized homophobia (IH). IH refers to when a sexual minority person internalizes social bias and develops a negative view of themselves, which is a likely process through which victimization and neuroticism impact mental health. Data were collected over three time points across 12 months, with 450 YMSM (mean age=18.9) and an 80.7 % retention rate. Two mediation analyses with bias-corrected bootstrapping using 1000 samples were conducted, controlling for age, race, and sexual orientation. Results revealed that victimization [F (9, 440)=4.83, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.09] and neuroticism [F (9, 440)=12.23, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.20] had a significant indirect effect on mental health via increased levels of IH. These findings show how external experiences of stigma and personality-level characteristics may impact YMSM in terms of their sense of self. Furthermore, these results support addressing social conditions that marginalize YMSM in order to promote better mental health through decreasing IH.

T1  - Parenting as Activism: Identity Alignment and Activist Persistence in the White Power Movement
AN  - 1802482673
AB  - This article addresses the relationship between identity and activism and discusses implications for social movement persistence. We explain how individuals negotiate opportunities as parents to align and extend an activist identity with a movement's collective expectations. Specifically, we focus on how participants in the U.S. white power movement use parenting as a key role to express commitment to the movement, develop correspondence among competing and potentially conflicting identities, and ultimately sustain their activism. We suggest that parenting may provide unique opportunities for activists in many movements to align personal, social, and collective movement identities and simultaneously affirm their identities as parents and persist as social movement activists.

T1  - Ethnicity Based Social Exclusion of Nomads in Khyber District Malakand, Pakhtunkhwa-Pakistan
AN  - 1932111386
AB  - This study aims at finding the links of ethnicity factors in social exclusion of nomads. The study nature was descriptive with main focus on to measure the association of ethnicity with social exclusion. The study notes the ethnic inequality within institutional rules, social attitudes and general practices and its contribution to social exclusion of nomadic communities. Social exclusion occurs because of numerous factors beyond individual or groups control, such as, religion, ethnicity, color, clan etc. It is multi-dimensional in nature, thus one factor, like ethnicity followed by unemployment, illiteracy, housing problems and lack of access to health care leads to social exclusion. This paper explores the contribution of ethnic affiliations' contribution in shaping exclusionary processes of nomads', with special focus on their relationship with the groups representing a dominant ethnic characteristic. The study was conducted during the year 2015 in Tehsil Dargai, District Malakand. A sample size of 97 respondents out of population of 130 was selected through random sampling procedure. Using a five level Likert scale collected the data. Chi square test was used to ascertain the association between ethnicity based deprivations and social exclusion among nomads. At bivariate level, social exclusion of nomads was found significantly associated with the stereotype perceptions of the people about nomadic way of life (P = 0.001) and the way policies are devised in our country (P = 0.004). Devising such policies that ensure special facilities to nomads and ensure their access to basic life facilities and public awareness to overcome the prejudices regarding nomadic way of life were major study recommendations.

T1  - Tolerance as a function of disapproval and respect: The case of Muslims
AN  - 1796451719
AB  - The article assesses a disapproval-respect model of tolerance according to which tolerance is made possible when disapproval of others' beliefs, preferences, or practices is balanced by respect for them as equal fellow citizens. Employing a sample of Muslims living in Germany, we predicted and found that such respect was more predictive of outgroup toleration when respondents disapproved rather than approved of the outgroups' beliefs, preferences, or practices. Moreover, respondents who displayed the critical combination of extreme disapproval and full respect indeed showed outgroup toleration. A parallel pattern of results was observed for willingness to engage in intergroup cooperation. Practical implications are discussed.

T1  - 'The antithesis of the film magnate': Irving Thalberg and the politics of ethno-religious identity in early Hollywood
AN  - 1798002590
AB  - As a powerful, high-profile member of Los Angeles' Jewish and German-American communities and a founder of MGM, the native-born, middle-class Irving Thalberg was framed as a 'better, finer' Jew as compared to his older, immigrant, US film industry mentors. This essay sheds new light on Thalberg's hybrid identity as German-Jewish-American, asking how it shaped his life, work, popular persona, and memory. As MGM production chief, Thalberg's work included shaping culture and philanthropy in 1920s and 1930s Los Angeles. Then and now, Thalberg as 'model minority' both challenged and reinforced pernicious ethno-religious stereotypes that undergirded myths of Jewish media domination in an industrializing America.

T1  - Ethnic Speech and Ethnic Action as Ethnic Behavior: Part 2. Validation of the Brunel Ethnic Behavior Inventory
AN  - 1787542465
AB  - This study sought to validate the Brunel Ethnic Behavior Inventory (BEBI) as a measure of two aspects of "doing" (i.e., ethnic speech and ethnic action) among the "ways of ethnicity" identified by Verkuyten. It also evaluates the construct validity of the BEBI alongside the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised (MEIM-R) and evaluates the BEBI and the MEIM-R (the latter of which measures exploration as "thinking" and commitment as "feeling" among ways of ethnicity) regarding criterion-related validity. Across two samples (n = 120 for Sample 1 and n = 148 for Sample 2), the BEBI and the MEIM-R performed suitably with regard to construct validity. However, the BEBI arguably performed better with regard to criterion-related validity (i.e., in predicting scores on life satisfaction, flourishing, positive and negative moods, and positive and negative emotions). Implications for validation studies on ways of ethnicity are discussed.

T1  - Race and ethnicity in the construction of the nation in Spain: the case of the Maragatos
AN  - 1789866342
AB  - Nationalism and its counterpart, modernism, are projects that involve the attempt to homogenize and incorporate the masses through the creation of a majority identity that usually leads to the classification of certain deviant groups as 'others'. In Spain, civic and ethnic nationalisms driven by the state have historically drawn on cultural and biological notions of ethnicity and race to construct a representation of the Maragatos as 'cursed peoples', while at the same time homogenizing and incorporating them into the nation in practice. By tracing a genealogy of the origins and evolution of the representations of Maragato otherness created during the Enlightenment era, the Franco dictatorship and the current super-modern period, this paper argues that representations of otherness significantly influence current research agendas and understandings of identity well beyond the disappearance of the actual subjects described as others.

T1  - White [not =] Poor: Whites Distance, Derogate, and Deny Low-Status Ingroup Members
AN  - 1933734197
AB  - Throughout society, White people of low socioeconomic status (SES) face prejudice, often from racial ingroup members. The present research tested the ingroup distancing effect , which predicts that Whites' negative reactions to low-SES ingroup members are motivated responses to perceived threats to their personal and group-level status. To cope with perceived status threats, White people psychologically and physically distance themselves from low-SES Whites. Four studies provide converging support for this theorizing. Among White participants, low-SES Whites elicited derogation, impaired racial categorization and memory, and inflated perceived personal status. White participants explicitly perceived low-SES Whites as greater status threats than low-SES Blacks, and these perceptions of threat predicted increased discomfort in anticipated social situations with low-SES White targets. Moreover, threatened status led Whites who strongly identified with their racial ingroup to physically distance themselves from a low-SES White partner. This research demonstrates that concerns with status motivate prejudice against ingroup members.

T1  - Signifying, Narrativizing, and Repetition: Radical Approaches to Theorizing African American Language: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1881718073
AB  - Code-switching and code-meshing pedagogies, though they are two vastly different approaches, do not consider that some features of African American Verbal Tradition (AVT) are and/or have become rhetorically effective mainstream communication structures in academic writing. This article explores how teaching language/dialect difference in majority white school settings, using contrastive-analysis techniques such as code switching may have highly negative effects on African American Language (AAL) speakers. Code-switching maintains that AAL and other "non-standard" language varieties are only appropriate for use in the home or social settings. Thus, as an alternative to code-switching pedagogical practices, the author introduces a comparative approach that may be applied across all minority language groups. This technique highlights African and African American contributions to standardized American written communication structures and demonstrates the value of AVT in academic settings. In the accompanying lesson plan, students are invited to think about how the English language, as a field, is constantly evolving and changing in our diverse, ever-widening international community; they are then given opportunities to use various writing instruction pedagogies to articulate theories, histories, methods, and practices.

T1  - Ancient objects with modern meanings: museums, volunteers, and the Anglo-Saxon 'Staffordshire Hoard' as a marker of twenty-first century regional identity
AN  - 1751730805
AB  - The Staffordshire Hoard is the largest Anglo-Saxon gold hoard ever found. On display from soon after its discovery in 2009 during fundraising to secure it for the region, the Hoard has become a source of local pride in Staffordshire, receiving over a million visitors. This article explores the Hoard as a marker of identity, both in the past and in the present, and evaluates how the 'treasure process', museums, and museum volunteers are shaping public identification with the Anglo-Saxon past of the Mercian kingdom. Drawing on focus-group data, we argue that aspects of the naming and display of the Hoard have encouraged its inclusion in existing narratives of belonging and 'authenticity' in Staffordshire. Such archaeological discoveries have the potential to provide points of continuity between the post-industrial present and the distant past, and stimulate a reconsideration of the present status of the region in contemporary cultural and political discourse.

T1  - Marginal and happy? The need for uniqueness predicts the adjustment of marginal immigrants
AN  - 1773421027
AB  - Marginalization is often presented as the strategy associated with the worst adjustment for immigrants. This study identifies a critical variable that buffers marginal immigrants from the negative effects of marginalization on adjustment: The need for uniqueness. In three studies, we surveyed immigrants recruited on university campuses (n = 119, n = 116) and in the field (n = 61). Among marginal immigrants, a higher need for uniqueness predicted higher self-esteem (Study 1), affect (Study 2), and life satisfaction (Study 3), and marginally higher happiness (Study 2) and self-esteem (Study 3). No relationship between the need for uniqueness and adjustment was found among non-marginal immigrants. The adaptive value of the need for uniqueness for marginal immigrants is discussed.

T1  - At which geographic scale does ethnic diversity affect intra-neighborhood social capital?
AN  - 1732943327
AB  - The claim that ethnic diversity within the living environment would hamper bonding and bridging social capital has been studied extensively, producing highly inconsistent findings. We studied whether ethnic diversity effects depend on the geographic scale at which ethnic diversity is measured. We examined ethnic diversity effects on intra- and inter-ethnic contacts in the neighborhood, respectively on opposition to ethnic in- and out-group neighbors. Hypotheses were derived from Blau's meeting opportunities thesis and contact theory, ethnic competition theory, and constrict theory. Using information about 2545 Dutch respondents with their locality defined as egohoods and administrative units, we found that ethnic diversity effects vary with the geographic scale. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is positively associated with bridging social capital. At larger scales, the findings are mixed: ethnic diversity is positively related to inter-ethnic contacts and opposition to out-group neighbors. Ethnic diversity of smaller localities is negatively related to bonding social capital. In contrast to often-made claims that diversity within the local context would matter most, estimates of diversity effects are not always stronger when diversity measures are aggregated to smaller geographic areas.

T1  - Russian Jewish Immigrants in the United States
AN  - 1734967234
AB  - This paper is concerned with the determinants of the English language proficiencies and labor market earnings of adult Russian Jewish male and female immigrants to the United States, compared to other immigrants, using the pooled files of the American Community Survey (2005-09). Although at arrival the Russian Jewish immigrants report lower levels of English skills and earnings, they experience a more rapid improvement over time, and eventually attain parity or higher levels than other immigrants. Moreover, they appear to obtain greater earnings (compared to other immigrants) in the US labor market from their schooling, their time in the United States, and their English proficiency. These findings mirror those found in earlier post-war data (1980-2000 Census) and, to the extent comparable, late 19th and early 20th century studies of Russian Jewish immigrants. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the Conference on Contemporary Russian-Speaking Jewish Diaspora, Harvard University, November 13-15, 2011.

T1  - Sexual Orientation and Substance Use: The Moderation of Parental Attachment
AN  - 1900193657
AB  - There is a substantial amount of research exploring patterns of sexual orientation and substance use, often finding increased substance use for non-heterosexuals. An additional body of research explores the concept of family support from a number of perspectives. There is a noted lack of overlay between family support, sexual orientation, and substance use. This research uses data from Waves III and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine how parental attachment, as a measure of family support, may moderate the association between sexual orientation and substance use. We test the notion that as parental attachment increases, substance use patterns will decrease for both heterosexual and non-heterosexual individuals. We also hypothesize that parental attachment will have a stronger effect of decreasing substance use for non-heterosexuals than for heterosexuals.

T1  - (How) does positive and negative extended cross-group contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes?
AN  - 1735657053; 201536816
AB  - Knowing that fellow ingroup members have cross-group contact can affect how people think, feel, and behave towards an out-group. Previous research on extended contact focused almost exclusively on positive cross-group interactions, neglecting the fact that extended contact can also be negative. In this contribution, we introduce negative extended contact and investigate how both forms of extended contact predict direct cross-group contact and intergroup attitudes. In two cross-sectional studies (N1=286, N2=237), we found evidence that positive and negative extended contact uniquely predict intergroup attitudes, and that direct cross-group contact mediates this effect. In Study 2, we also provide initial evidence that extended contact might either prepare for or impair direct contact by changing ingroup norms and intergroup self-efficacy, which in turn influence feelings of intergroup anxiety.

AN  - 1733451578
AB  - Migration not only represents a displacement of inhabitants, tangible and symbolic things, or generates changes, but it also produces a constant deterritorialization and reterritorialization of perceptions, feelings, and memories. These processes represent a disruption or break in ways of life and identities. The community of San Cristobal is "constructing" itself as Afro-Colombian as a way of resisting perceived threats of displacement. In San Cristóbal, the threat of deterritorialization is the main trigger of the current processes of identity construction. Residents' transformation from peasants to Afro-Colombians is anchored to the spatial factor. Consequently, their experience shows that territory becomes an essential part of identity, where places and spaces take historical meanings in creating identity discourses.

T1  - Labelling and discrimination: Do homophobic epithets undermine fair distribution of resources?
AN  - 1728660206; 201533932
AB  - This research investigated the behavioural consequences of homophobic epithets. After exposure to either a category or a homophobic label, heterosexual participants allocated fictitious resources to two different prevention programmes: one mainly relevant to heterosexuals (sterility prevention), the other to homosexuals (AIDS-HIV prevention). Responses on allocation matrices served to identify strategies that favoured the ingroup over the outgroup. Results indicated stronger ingroup-favouritism in the homophobic than in the category label condition. This study shows that discriminatory group labels have tangible effects on people's monetary behaviours in intergroup contexts, increasing their tendency to favour the ingroup when distributing resources.

T1  - Dual Identification and the (De-)Politicization of Migrants: Longitudinal and Comparative Evidence
AN  - 1728660158; 201533984
AB  - The article examines the role of dual identification with both the ethnocultural ingroup and the society of residence in the politicization of migrants. The researchers employed a longitudinal and comparative research design with members of the two largest, but sociologically very different, migrant groups in Germany as research participants (i.e. Turkish migrants and Russian migrants). In line with prior work that has shown that, among members of aggrieved groups, dual identity functions as a politicized collective identity, we found that dual identification fostered political engagement among Turkish migrants. In contrast, Russian migrants reported no substantial grievances, and dual identification negatively affected their subsequent political engagement. The contributions of these findings to an articulation of research on politicization with research on intergroup conflict and a more comprehensive understanding of political phenomena driven by dual identification are discussed.

T1  - Australian Muslim Jobseekers and Social Capital
AN  - 1685997106
AB  - In spite of the above, the educational attainment profile of Muslims in Australia is "either similar to or better than non-Muslim Australians. This applies to both Muslim men and women" ([Hassan] 2010, 579) even though qualifications do not translate into equitable labour force participation (Akbarzadeh, [G. Bouma], and [R. Woodlock] 2009). Muslims in Australia endure high levels of prejudice and intolerance (United Nations 2010), constituting a distinct labour market disadvantage ([Kabir] and Evans 2002). Muslims are frequently named by public sources as representing a threat to the nation (Northcote and [S. Casimiro] 2010). The Australian media has focused intensely on the risks posed by radical Islamist terrorism for Western nations (Rane 2010). Imtoual (2010, 56) names prejudice against Muslims in Australia as "religious racism". Anti-Muslim attitudes, negative stereotyping and cultural racism and discrimination, especially since 9/11, serve to disadvantage Muslims, creating limited opportunities for Muslim jobseekers in some occupations. Many Muslims "believe that as a result of this media bias, they are vilified in society, and particularly in the workplace" (Kabir 2006,313; see also Wise and [J. Ali] 2008). The subtle and not-so-subtle discrimination that Muslim jobseekers encounter constitutes a major obstacle to their labour force engagement (Kabir and Evans 2002). In viewing our data through a lens of social capital, we include this background Islamophobia when considering the preference for networking and support that we found among Muslim jobseeker informants.              Jobseekers of Muslim faith in Australia come from diverse backgrounds. Not only do they belong to many different ethnic groups but they vary widely in terms of length of time in Australia, English language fluency, educational attainment and labour market experience. They might be refugees, but might as easily be first, second and third generation immigrants. It was therefore a research challenge to study Muslim jobseekers as a group, even though this was the brief given by the project funding body itself: an Australian Government department, and we could not depart from it. Yet, in spite of the diversity of our informants, we found significant points of similarity in the Muslim jobseekers' accounts of their difficulties in entering the labour market, difficulties which were not inherent in ethnicity or any of the characteristics listed above. Rather, the participants in this study were judged, and felt judged first as Muslims, especially women who wore the headscarf and those who favoured pious practices. For example, one woman said,"[It's] not my accent but my appearance. So many times when I get a job over the phone and they ask me for interview. I could see the reaction when they see me wearing this scarf. They slam the door in my face" (R3,30s, F, Malaysian migrant). A male informant told us,"For me I try my best to dress up nicely and shave my beard almost everyday as I do not want anybody to think I am a complicated Muslim, could go to pray five times a day" (A3, 43, M, Arab-Iraqi refugee). We have already reported on our findings of the experience of Islamophobia for Muslim jobseekers elsewhere (see Lovat, Nilan, [H. Hosseini], Samarayi, Mansfield and Alexander 2013a, 2013b; Nilan 2011,2012; Nilan, Samarayi and Lovat 2012). In this article we focus on the strategies and networking practised by those who encounter implicit or explicit anti-Muslim prejudice in looking for work. It is appropriate not just to depict the social suffering of Muslim jobseekers but to give due consideration to the networking and communication strategies this group use to overcome such labour market disadvantage. The concept of social capital is a useful heuristic for the task we undertake below.

T1  - Ethnicity and Trust: A Multifactorial Experiment
AN  - 1752995239; 201600174
AB  - This article reports the results of an online experiment conducted in two ethnically fragmented societies in Spain: the Basque Country and Catalonia. It tests the effect of co-ethnicity on trust and reciprocity. Ethnicity was manipulated in the experimental context using three ethnic attributes: ancestors' origin, language and name. Additionally, the article reports a comparison of general levels of trust in the two regions. No co-ethnicity effect on trust is found, but there is significantly more reciprocal behaviour between Catalan speakers in Catalonia. Higher levels of trust and reciprocity are found in the more homogeneous society of the Basque Country. The lack of co-ethnicity effect on trust is especially significant given that the Basque Country has experienced decades of terrorism along ethnic lines. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Why are all the White (Asian) kids sitting together in the cafeteria? Resegregation and the role of intergroup attributions and norms
AN  - 1700673354; 201525070
AB  - Over three studies, we identified the phenomenon of ethnic 'resegregation' and assessed the extent to which it was predicted by attributions and norms, among other variables. Study 1, an observational study, showed extensive resegregation between White and Asian students in the cafeteria of a highly mixed school. In Study 2, we found evidence of attributional correspondence for White students, who attributed both their own and the outgroup's contact avoidance more to a lack of interest than fear of rejection, whereas Asian students attributed the outgroup's contact avoidance more to lack of interest, but preferred neither explanation of their own avoidance. In Study 3, we observed a pattern of attributional correspondence among both White and Asian students who attributed both their own and the outgroup's inaction in a hypothetical intergroup cafeteria scenario more to a lack of interest than fear of rejection. Study 3 also demonstrated longitudinally, for both groups, that own lack of interest in the outgroup reduced likelihood of cafeteria contact, whereas having outgroup friends and perceiving positive ingroup norms promoted it. In addition, positive outgroup norms promoted likelihood of cafeteria contact only for Asian students. We discuss how an understanding of the factors driving resegregation is critical to effectively realizing the potential of desegregated settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Preference for consistency and value dissimilarities in dehumanization and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia
AN  - 1700676275; 201524984
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the importance of differential attribution of uniquely human characteristics in dehumanization and prejudice. Relatively little is known, however, about the importance of perceiving dissimilarities between the ingroup and outgroup in different types of values (beyond prosocial values), or the role of preference for consistency (PFC). This study investigated values, perceived dissimilarities in values, and PFC, in dehumanization of and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia. Results from a survey of 140 Australians revealed a strong relationship between dehumanization and prejudice. Individuals with stronger conservation and self-enhancement values, and greater perceived dissimilarity to asylum seekers on self-transcendence and self-enhancement values, dehumanized asylum seekers more and were more prejudiced toward them. The relationships between perceived self-transcendence and self-enhancement dissimilarities and prejudice were mediated by dehumanization, whereas PFC moderated the relationship between conservation value differences and dehumanization. These findings offer important insight into the conditions that promote dehumanization and prejudice, which may in turn help explain the negative perceptions of asylum seekers in Australia.

T1  - Low status groups show in-group favoritism to compensate for their low status and compete for higher status
AN  - 1700674204; 201524903
AB  - The present research investigated the intergroup allocation behavior of members of low-status groups. In two studies where status relations were either relatively illegitimate (Study 1, N = 139) or legitimate (Study 2, N = 114), undergraduate students completed a minimal group resource allocation task that took into account the intergroup status hierarchy. In both studies, members of low-status groups showed two forms of in-group favoritism. They selected resource allocation choices that (a) compensated for their low status and led to intergroup fairness (compensatory favoritism) and (b) competed with the out-group for status and led to positive distinctiveness for the in-group (competitive favoritism). These results suggest that members of low-status groups use in-group favoritism to make their group (a) as good as the high-status out-group and (b) better than the high-status out-group. The findings support the idea that in-group favoritism can serve different functions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Threat by association: Do distant intergroup threats carry-over into local intolerance?
AN  - 1660023686; 201505451
AB  - Individuals are often confronted with intergroup threats, yet many of these threats emanate from distant groups that most individuals are unlikely to encounter in their local environment. An important yet unanswered question is whether reactions to those threats, such as intolerance towards the threatening group, carry over to other groups that individuals actually do encounter in their local environment (e.g., immigrants). The main goal of our studies was to experimentally identify this carry-over effect of intergroup threat. Specifically, we hypothesized that (by definition relatively abstract) symbolic threats (e.g., threats to the ingroup's worldview) have an especially strong carry-over potential because those threats can be easily attributed to other outgroups. We tested these predictions in one correlational and two experimental studies. The results of all three studies confirmed our hypothesis that particularly distant symbolic threats were predictive of intolerance towards local outgroups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Parvenus and conflict in elite cohorts
AN  - 1559004714; 201431986
AB  - Previous studies find that greater workplace diversity leads to higher degrees of conflict in low and medium-status workgroups. This paper examines whether similar dynamics operate in elite cohorts. We use data from a survey of White House Fellows (N = 475) to look at how the presence of parvenus-individuals from underrepresented groups in elite environments-change the rate at which fellows reported conflict with each other and with the director of the program. We find that there is no unified 'parvenu experience.' Analysis of the interaction between race and cohort diversity reveals inflection points consistent with Kanter's (1977) theory of tokenism, but the effects of increasing diversity diverge: for Hispanics, conflict with the director increases with diversity, while for Asians, conflict falls with diversity. While other groups' level of conflict with their peers stays roughly constant, Asians' reported level of conflict with their peers increases with diversity. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - INDIGENOUSNESS WITHOUT ETHNICITY IN THE SIERRA NORTE OF OAXACA, MEXICO: NATIVES, OUTSIDERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED IDENTITIES
AN  - 1622294344; 201438454
AB  - This article analyses the relationship between an ethnic, indigenous and community-based identities in the communities of Ixtlan and Guelatao in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico. Local identities and sense of belonging to the communities prevail over ethnic identification amongst the inhabitants of these communities. The strengthening of local (community-based) identity has been achieved through an internal social organisation and categorisation of the inhabitants based on their origin as a mechanism of integration, particularly in diverse communities with large numbers of outsiders. Parallel to this, new ways of defining indigenousness, without ethnic claims, are emerging through making reference to the practice of comunalidad and attachment to localities/communities.

T1  - Language, Ethnicity and Conflict: Applying Linguistic Measure to Prevent Ethnic Violence in Middle Belt Nigeria
AN  - 1718069501; 201530712
AB  - This research highlights the efficacy of community-based language planning initiatives in ethnic conflict and violence prevention. As a threshold which elucidates how linguistic measures can help to prevent inter-ethnic violence, the research illustrates that where ethnic safeguarding reaches the extremity of violence, language issues are found to have covert but very strong causal roles as manifested in the ethnic violent conflicts affecting Nigeria's Middle-Belt including the Berom/Afizere/Anaguta versus Hausa/Fulani; Taroh versus Hausa/Fulani (Plateau State); Tiv versus Etulo (Benue State); Tiv versus Jukun (Benue and Taraba States); and Jukun versus Kuteb (Taraba State). Paired t-test values set at a confidence interval of 95 per cent indicate that the statistical mean differences (1.60 in Tiv/Jukun and 9.60 in the Jos area) are close to the true difference occurrences in the randomly sampled populations. More significant are the two tailed P values of 0.5895 (Tiv/Jukun) showing low bilingualism; and 0.3477 (Jos area) depicting more acute bilingualism decline associated with the ethnic violence. The research then considers the application of linguistic measures vital to prevent ethnic violence. In particular, critiqued aspects of the Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scales (EGIDS) are recommended to ethnic communities, voluntary organisations and governments for implementation in dealing with violent conflicts.

T1  - Heterosexual Men's Confrontation of Sexual Prejudice: The Role of Precarious Manhood
AN  - 1520342848; 201420699
AB  - Prejudice and discrimination are unfortunate common realities for sexual minorities yet people rarely confront such behavior (Dickter 2012). This is especially problematic because confronting prejudice is one of the most effective weapons against it (e.g., Czopp and Monteith 2003). The present study explores whether men who perceive manhood to be an impermanent state easily taken away by engaging in gender role violations (i.e., precarious manhood; Vandello et al. 2008) are less likely to react negatively to sexually prejudiced interaction partners and therefore less likely to confront sexual prejudice. In addition, we tested whether non-confrontation serves to affirm meta-perceptions of heterosexuality. To test this hypothesis, 88 heterosexual, young adult males, drawn from the undergraduate population of a university in the northeastern U.S., were randomly assigned to either pair with a confederate who expressed blatant sexual prejudice or no blatant prejudice toward a gay applicant in a hiring discussion. Consistent with predictions, precarious manhood predicted lower rates of confronting sexual prejudice, and less negative responses to their interaction partner, while confronting prejudice was associated with believing one would be viewed as gay regardless of individual differences in precarious manhood.

T1  - Online Networks as a Venue for Social Support: A Qualitative Study of Married Bisexual Men in Taiwan
AN  - 1494748596; 201402051
AB  - Online networks have become a critical venue for bisexual males to communicate with each other and solicit social support. This study reports qualitative feedback gathered from 12 married Taiwanese bisexual men about online social support in their daily lives. The analysis of interviews reveal that online social support provides participants with opportunities to screen potential friends, participate in the bisexual virtual community, come out and release stress, and look for romance. Apparently, for married bisexual men in Taiwan, the Internet offers an opportunity to anonymously manage sexual identity and solicit social support among other bisexuals.

T1  - Shooting the messenger: Outsiders critical of your group are rejected regardless of argument quality
AN  - 1438557896; 201340034
AB  - People are more resistant to criticisms of their group when those criticisms are made by an outgroup rather than an ingroup member, a phenomenon referred to as the intergroup sensitivity effect (ISE). The current study compared four competing models of how argument quality would moderate the ISE, with a view to establishing the complex interrelationships between source and message effects in group-directed criticism. Quality of the argument affected responses to ingroup critics, but not to outgroup critics. For outsiders who wish to promote positive change and reform in a group culture, this leads to a somewhat depressing conclusion: their message is likely to be rejected regardless of whether it is objectively 'right', well-considered, well-justified, or well-argued.

T1  - Coping with HIV Related Stigma and Well-Being
AN  - 1346374342
AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the relationships to be found among stigma perception, active and avoidant coping strategies, and subjective and psychological well-being in a sample of 133 people with HIV. The results showed that stigma perception and avoidant coping strategies (venting, self-blame, denial, behavioral disengagement and substance use) were positively associated, whereas, both stigma perception and avoidant coping were negatively associated with different measures of well-being (affect balance, self-acceptance and environmental mastery). These negative relationships between stigma perception and the three well-being measures were mediated by the use of avoidant coping strategies. Results suggest that psychosocial intervention programs for people who report psychological distress arising from prejudice must be aimed at developing appropriate ways to deal with this prejudice. Intervention programs should also include strategies to directly increase well-being since from a positive psychology viewpoint certain interventions have been shown to do so, and HIV research has also shown that well-being is associated with lower mortality rates.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Playing with deviance: Typicality assessments of ingroup members as a strategy of outgroup approach
AN  - 1417527000; 201331776
AB  - In two experiments, we analyzed the use of intra-group differentiation between normative and deviant members as an identity mobilization strategy in intergroup negotiations. Because ingroup members sometimes try to obtain the support of outgroup audiences to attain their goals, we propose that in intergroup negotiations, people attempt to minimize the distinction between the parties involved by changing the appraisal of deviance and including deviant members in the ingroup's prototype. In line with this hypothesis, differences in the assessment of typicality between normative and deviant targets were reduced in instrumental intergroup negotiation contexts. Furthermore, we explored a boundary condition for this effect and found that such outgroup approach is disrupted when threats taint the intergroup negotiation context.

T1  - Economic Prosperity as "Narcissistic Filling": A Missing Link Between Political Attitudes and Right-wing Authoritarianism
AN  - 1412576312
AB  - An expanded analysis of the origin of the correlation with economic deprivation found in the authors' representative surveys of right-wing extremist attitudes (such as racism, anti-Semitism, and chauvinism), focusing on the underlying dynamics in Germany and the historical aspect of National Socialism. The growing prosperity of the West German "economic miracle" of the 1950s served a psychosocial "filling function" to block the narcissistic damage caused by confrontation with past crimes and the sense of the nation's loss of greatness. As this prosperity vanishes for many people during the current economic crisis, the filling comes out and the narcissistic wound opens up. What emerges is both what lies underneath and what has been serving as a defense against it, which involve authoritarian dynamics. Initially, the metaphor of "narcissistic filling" will be developed through our analysis of group discussions conducted as part of our qualitative study (of 2008). The developed hypotheses will thereafter be introduced to our following representative survey (of 2010) and confirmed by means of quantitative methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - On being peripheral and paying attention: Prototypicality and information processing in intergroup conflict
AN  - 1373429366; 201328473
AB  - Intergroup conflicts are ubiquitous -- they occur, for instance, between (work)groups, departments, organizations, political parties, or nations. Such conflicts are commonly addressed through negotiations, in which representatives negotiate on behalf of their constituency. Intergroup negotiations are complex, as representatives need to navigate between the interests of their own constituency and the other party. This implies that negotiation success requires careful processing of information about both parties' interests. Here, we examine how representative negotiators' motivation to engage in such thorough information processing is influenced by their position in the group. Whereas prototypical representatives feel secure about their membership, peripheral representatives have a less certain position. We propose that peripheral representatives are therefore more attentive and responsive to information that may be relevant to the negotiation than prototypical representatives, but only when they are accountable to their constituents. Data from 4 experiments showed that peripheral representatives reported higher information-processing motivation (Experiment 1), bought and recalled more information (Experiment 2), exhibited greater sensitivity to emotional expressions of the outgroup representative (Experiment 3), and attained more integrative ("win-win") agreements (Experiment 4) than prototypical representatives, but only when they were accountable. The findings are discussed in relation to theorizing on group dynamics, motivated information processing, emotion, and intergroup conflict, and practical implications are considered.

T1  - Longings and belongings: Indian American youth identity, folk dance competitions, and the construction of 'tradition'
AN  - 1315602787; 201307516
AB  - This article examines the development of the 'cultural competition' as a site for the production of multiple identities by Indian American youths on American college campuses. Through the examination of two categories of folk dance competitions (bhangra and raas-garba) at a private university in Washington, DC, we argue that these competitions appear to resist hybridity and produce rhetoric that marginalizes diasporic culture in favour of the 'pure' and 'authentic' culture of the homeland. However, the goal of expressing uncontaminated 'authentic' culture is not realized as diasporic identities and cultures consistently interrupt and undermine homogenizing narratives of 'tradition' and 'authenticity'. We also demonstrate that these folk dance groups often reinforce an ethno-regional distinctiveness rather than a hybrid or pan-Indian identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - In the shadow of the 'Arab Spring': the fate of non-Muslims under Islamist rule
AN  - 1660023774; 201507217
AB  - In the view of many non-Muslims, Islam is a religion that promotes hatred and violence and claims are repeatedly heard of how difficult it is for non-Muslim minorities to live in peace and harmony in Muslims countries. Moreover, recent clashes between Muslim and Christian groups in the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution have exacerbated prejudices against Islam, namely that it is a religion that promotes violence and that Muslims are inherently militant and irrational people who cannot tolerate living and cooperating with the followers of other religions. This misconception has sounded alarm bells amongst many Arab Christian leaders, who warn Christians in the Arab world of the danger of allowing Muslim groups to rule. It therefore becomes imperative to counter such depictions. The aim of this article is to explain from a qur'anic point of view what should characterize Muslim relations and attitudes towards non-Muslims in day-to-day life and the rules that should be applied to non-Muslims. It concentrates on a selection of key qur'anic verses relating to the subject and attempts to demonstrate that Islam as prescribed in the Qur'an and exemplified by the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his Companions accepts, celebrates and even encourages diversity, harmony and peaceful co-existence with non-Muslims.

T1  - European Shiism? Counterpoints from Shiites' organization in Britain and the Netherlands
AN  - 1448998026; 201342959
AB  - European Shiism is a neglected area in studies of European Islam, which raises the question of to what extent Shiism in Europe represents a particular realm of organization and a particular religiosity. Shiism's striking transnational features, and general findings on European Islam, suggest prolific border-crossing and cross-ethnic organization among Shiites in Europe. Exploring British and Dutch cases, however, leaves little room for the notion of a specific European Shiite realm. When focusing on the ethnic-national background of board members of Shiite organizations and on their formal organizational interlocks, ethnically articulate identities come to the fore, particular mixes of which take shape within sub-European frameworks of states. The last section explores sociopolitical implications of Shiites' organizational life in Europe, as seen through the Dutch and British samples. A contrast is drawn between the relative scarcity of Shiite organization, which delimits the role of Shiism as a political actor in Europe, and recent indications of civic engagement.

T1  - Accomplished Black North Americans and Antiracism Education: Towards Bridging a Seeming Divide
AN  - 1221409971; 201244041
AB  - This article examines the seeming historical disconnect between antiracism education and successful, highly educated, and upwardly mobile black North Americans. Many successful blacks tend to resist racism via strategies informed by the hegemonic neoliberal and individualistic ethos, with the key strategies being educational and occupational attainment. Such individualistic strategies are opposed by antiracism education, which emphasizes battling racism on structural and institutional levels. I argue that this disconnect between middle-class black consciousness and antiracist discourse stems from the general failure of antiracist scholarship to understand adequately the complex and conflicted identities and lived experiences of many successful blacks. This failure on the part of antiracist scholarship can be attributed to a historical premising on binary racial categories and zero-sum conceptions of power. However, recent post-structuralist trends in antiracist scholarship, such as an increasing emphasis on integrative antiracism, hold the promise of creating an antiracist discourse that better resonates with successful blacks.

T1  - Homophobia and the Transition to Adulthood: A Three Year Panel Study among Belgian Late Adolescents and Young Adults, 2008-2011
AN  - 1037273390; 22752949
AB  - Studies on homophobia among adolescents routinely depart from the assumption that this attitude will be continued into adulthood. However, little research has been conducted on how the transition toward adulthood actually affects homophobia. While earlier studies relied on cross-sectional observations, the present analysis makes use of the Belgian Political Panel Survey (2008-2011), tracking 2,815 respondents (52 % female, 48 % male) between the ages of 18 and 21. A conditional change model shows that while men had substantially higher levels of homophobia than women to begin with, this difference grew even larger throughout the observation period. The discrepancy between Muslim respondents and those with other religions became larger as well. Overall, the gender and religious differences already present in adolescence had become further polarized at the end of the observation period. Friendship relations with persons with a different sexual orientation, on the other hand, significantly reduced prejudice, especially among men, while the results also show that changes in the level of homophobia are related strongly to conservative views on gender roles. We conclude that groups that already display high levels of homophobia during adolescence are likely to grow even more extreme in their views in the transition to adulthood.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Not black, but Habasha: Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants in American society
AN  - 1567048925; 201435136
AB  - In this article, I examine the identity choices of Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrants of Amhara, Tigrayan and Tigrinya ethnicity within the context of the larger debate on how non-white immigrants are being incorporated into American society. I argue that these immigrants resist racialization even while their actions and attitudes potentially reinforce America's racial divide. They implicitly challenge American racial categories by thinking of themselves as Habasha, which they view as a separate non-black ethno-racial category that emphasizes their Semitic origins. Meanwhile, they often distance themselves from American blacks through pursuing transnational connections, producing Habasha spaces, displaying the attributes of a 'model minority' and preserving Habasha beauty through endogamy. By remaining relatively isolated within their ethnic communities in Washington, DC, which is the focus of this study, they may succeed in differentiating themselves from American blacks, but they are not likely to join the American mainstream on a par with whites.

T1  - Minorities in democracy and policing policy: from alienation to cooperation
AN  - 1322722493; 201312748
AB  - Tense relations between the Israeli police and the Arab citizens of Israel have been a major concern in recent years. Policing provides a challenge in democracies with diverse societies where cultures, religions and competing national identities challenge the existing order, and where the police in many cases have yet to develop the capabilities to engage with diversity and overcome its own biases and prejudices in order to better serve minorities. While police officers and policy-makers may be aware of the need to initiate reform in order to succeed, they need to identify the actual needs of minorities. In this study of police reforms in Israel vis-a-vis the Arab minority we propose a bottom-up study of the potential impact of three types of reforms: recruitment of Arab citizens to the police, cultural training of police officers and institutionalising police-community relations. Our findings are based on two complementary stages of research, four focus groups and a comprehensive research survey of a representative sample of 1006 adult Arab citizens.

T1  - Longitudinal intergroup contact effects on prejudice using self- and observer-reports
AN  - 1283641761; 201303135
AB  - Longitudinal effects of intergroup contact on prejudice were investigated in a sample of 65 young adults (Sample 1) and a sample of their close friends (Sample 2, N= 172), adopting a full cross-lagged panel design. We first validated the self-report measure of intergroup contact from Sample 1 with observer ratings from Sample 2 by demonstrating that self-reports and observer ratings of contact were highly correlated. Moreover, we obtained significant cross-lagged effects of intergroup contact on prejudice with both contact measures, thereby providing a second validation for the use of self-reports of intergroup contact. Finally, by the use of latent change modelling, we demonstrated that, although no overall significant change in contact and prejudice over time was found, there was meaningful variation in absolute change in the individual levels of intergroup contact and prejudice. In particular, some individuals showed increases while others showed decreases in contact or prejudice across time. Moreover, higher levels of intergroup contact at Time 1 were followed by larger subsequent decreases in prejudice between Time 1 and Time 2, and changes in contact were significantly and negatively related to changes in prejudice. Methodological implications of the findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial Pride and Religiosity among African American Boys: Implications for Academic Motivation and Achievement
AN  - 927127234; 21611827
AB  - The persistent underachievement among African American boys has led to increased empirical inquiry, yet little research considers within-group variation in achievement nor positive youth characteristics that help explain positive achievement outcomes. This study conceptualized culturally-based factors (racial pride and religiosity) as adolescent assets that would promote African American boys' achievement and also enhance positive effects of other youth assets (positive educational utility beliefs) on achievement. Our sample included 158 adolescent boys (M = 17.08) from a large, socioeconomically diverse suburban community context. Accounting for demographic background variables, educational utility beliefs were positively associated with academic grade performance. A significant educational utility beliefs and racial pride interaction indicated a stronger, positive association of educational utility beliefs with grade performance among boys with higher racial pride relative to those with lower racial pride. Also, there was a stronger positive association between educational utility beliefs and grades for boys reporting lower religious importance, but boys endorsing both lower educational utility beliefs and religious importance were at highest risk for low grade performance. Overall results suggest the importance of considering culturally-based factors in studying achievement motivation processes among ethnic minority adolescents.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cultural Threat and Anti-immigrant Prejudice: The Case of Protestants in Northern Ireland
AN  - 964200522; 201207280
AB  - Cultural threat has emerged as a consistent predictor of anti-immigrant and anti-minority attitudes across many different national contexts. We examine this issue in the context of Northern Ireland using representative survey data, suggesting that Protestant and unionist communities experience a higher level of cultural threat than Catholic and nationalist communities on account of the 'parity of esteem' principle that has informed changes in the province since the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Our analyses confirm that, although there is evidence for some level of anti-immigrant sentiment across all groups, Protestants and unionists do indeed report relatively more negative attitudes towards a range of immigrant and ethnic target groups compared with Catholics, nationalists or respondents who do not identify with any political category. The analyses further suggest that their higher level of perceived cultural threat partially accounts for this difference. We argue that cultural threat can be interpreted as a response to changes in Northern Ireland that have challenged the dominant status enjoyed by Protestants and unionists in the past. More generally, we argue that a politicised characterisation of cultural threat needs to be elaborated through future work. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Reactance, the self, and its group: When threats to freedom come from the ingroup versus the outgroup
AN  - 1030866836; 201227643
AB  - We investigated the assumption that independent versus interdependent self-construals yield different manifestations of psychological reactance in different group contexts. We expected collectivists (interdependent) to value the collective freedom of an ingroup more in face of an outgroup threat than individualists (independent) who should be protective of their individual freedom especially within an ingroup. In Study 1, we showed that collectivists (Taiwanese students) did not show reactance when a threat to their freedom of choice originated in the ingroup, but they did show reactance when it originated in an outgroup. In Study 2, Austrian students showed more reactance the more interdependent their self-construal was when confronted with an outgroup restriction. However, the more independent Austrian students' self-construal was, the more reactance they showed when the threat came from the ingroup. Priming an independent (versus interdependent) self-construal in Study 3, we again observed more reactance when freedom was restricted by the ingroup. The findings underline the importance of understanding psychological reactance as a socially situated phenomenon. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - What is an "appropriate" migrant? Impact of the adoption of meritocratic worldviews by potential newcomers on their perceived ability to integrate into a Western society
AN  - 1030866584; 201227681
AB  - The acceptance of migrant populations and the definition of an "appropriate" migrant are controversial issues in many countries. The present research focuses on the ideological determinants of how newcomers are evaluated by a host population in a Western country with a strongly rooted meritocratic ideology. We carried out two studies to examine how the expression of meritocratic beliefs by a male potential migrant affects the way he is evaluated by the host population. We measured the host population's perception of the potential migrant's ability to integrate into society, his tendency to adopt the host country's culture, and the general desirability of his world vision for all newcomers. We also noted the host population's judgments of the target's agency and communality. The results showed that a potential newcomer who expresses a strong (vs. weak) belief in a just world (Study 1) or an internal (vs. external) locus of control (Study 2) is evaluated more favorably by the host population. In addition, judgments of the target's integration capacity were only mediated by his perceived agency. We discuss these results in the light of work on the meritocratic ideology and intercultural relations. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Our Flaws Are More Human Than Yours: Ingroup Bias in Humanizing Negative Characteristics
AN  - 964191153; 201207245
AB  - Four studies investigated whether people tend to see ingroup flaws as part of human nature (HN) to a greater degree than outgroup flaws. In Study 1, people preferentially ascribed high HN flaws to their ingroup relative to two outgroups. Study 2 demonstrated that flaws were rated higher on HN when attributed to the ingroup than when attributed to an outgroup, and no such difference occurred for positive traits. Study 3 replicated this humanizing ingroup flaws (HIF) effect and showed that it was (a) independent of desirability and (b) specific to the HN sense of humanness. Study 4 replicated the results of Study 3 and demonstrated that the HIF effect is amplified under ingroup identity threat. Together, these findings show that people humanize ingroup flaws and preferentially ascribe high HN flaws to the ingroup. These ingroup humanizing biases may serve a group-protective function by mitigating ingroup flaws as "only human.".

T1  - Situating the Body: Choreographies of Transmigration
AN  - 1364700235; 201323393
AB  - This paper aims to ask questions about how interculturalism might be informed by thinking through choreography. It examines the techniques and strategies of two Malaysian-Australian artists, Chandrabhanu and Yap, whose transmigration has constructed new forms of subjectivity from the memories and histories of dancing bodies. It asks how embodied experience, that includes dance knowledges, adapts before and after other social and political adjustments? It will examine how their choreography develops as a means to imagine the self beyond hegemonic political and social models of identity. In this regard, we have utilised the work of Stoetzler and Yuval-Davis to theorise the concept of the situated imagination and Sara Ahmed to complicate an understanding of diasporic experience in relation to home and belonging. We 'trace the cross-pollination between various states' in migratory bodies as forms of intercultural embodiment. Through discussion of two productions we consider in what ways Chandrabhanu and Yap establish modes of performative, and thus affective belonging, to place and nation.

T1  - Affective mediators of intergroup contact: A three-wave longitudinal study in South Africa
AN  - 964187094; 201207308
AB  - Intergroup contact (especially cross-group friendship) is firmly established as a powerful strategy for combating group-based prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Great advances have been made in understanding how contact reduces prejudice (Brown & Hewstone, 2005), highlighting the importance of affective mediators (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). The present study, a 3-wave longitudinal study undertaken among minority-status Colored high school children in South Africa (N = 465), explored the full mediation of the effects of cross-group friendships on positive outgroup attitudes, perceived outgroup variability, and negative action tendencies via positive (affective empathy) and negative (intergroup anxiety) affective mediators simultaneously. The target group was the majority-status White South African outgroup. As predicted, a bidirectional model described the relationship between contact, mediators, and prejudice significantly better over time than either autoregressive or unidirectional longitudinal models. However, full longitudinal mediation was only found in the direction from Time 1 contact to Time 3 prejudice (via Time 2 mediators), supporting the underlying tenet of the contact hypothesis. Specifically, cross-group friendships were positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes (via affective empathy) and perceived outgroup variability (via intergroup anxiety and affective empathy) and were negatively associated with negative action tendencies (via affective empathy). Following Pettigrew and Tropp (2008), we compared two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship between intergroup anxiety and affective empathy over time. Time 1 intergroup anxiety was indirectly negatively associated with Time 3 affective empathy, via Time 2 cross-group friendships. We discuss the theoretical and empirical contributions of this study and make suggestions for future research. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Social Psychology, Religion and Inter-Group Relations: Hamas Leaders' Media Talk about their Vision for the Future
AN  - 914768125; 201200109
AB  - This paper focuses on the relationship between Islam and the secular aspects of society which differentiate Islamic societies from other states. Bound up with this question is the issue of the extent to which Islamists challenge proposals that religion should be 'set aside' when people act as citizens by arguing that Islam embraces the whole of life. Using discourse analysis we examine extracts from media interviews with leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement about Islam and its application within the Gaza strip. The interviewees construct religion as being congruent with existing social practices within Gaza. This allows interviewees to make three claims: that the introduction of Islam will make no difference to existing society, that Islam will be tolerant of existing social practices, and that potentially criticisable political acts should be viewed in civic rather than religious terms. By so doing, the interviewees display sensitivity to potential distinctions between religious and civic practices and attend to inferences that might arise in respect of inter-group relations. Constructions of religion and of civic society can thus be viewed as participants' rather than analysts' concerns and should be examined for their functions within both distal and local contexts.

T1  - How Narrative Relationships Overcome Empathic Bias: Elizabeth Gaskell's Empathy across Social Difference
AN  - 896188916; 201120055
AB  - Modern and historical scholarship on empathy has consistently demonstrated that people are more likely to empathize with those who are similar to themselves. This empathic bias for similarity means that the affective bonds and ethical motivations that accompany empathy are significantly diminished in relationships with outgroups, as defined by sociological difference. I argue that narrative empathy is uniquely capable of circumventing the similarity bias through compositional strategies related to foregrounding and perspective. Turning to modern research on reading as well as to accounts of reading in the nineteenth century, I propose a two-part argument: first, that the act of reading can overcome the bias that scholars have observed in relationships between people and, second, that narrative empathy has the potential to prevent future cases of bias by reconfiguring readers' criteria for similarity. In an extended case study of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel Mary Barton: A Tale of Manchester Life (1848), I argue that Victorian social-problem literature thematizes empathy across difference and that the self-conscious treatment of cultural difference is particularly helpful for overcoming similarity bias.

T1  - Sport Fans' Impressions of Gay Male Athletes
AN  - 902085268; 201122220
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine sport fans' impressions of gay male athletes. Participants formed impressions of a fictional athlete from their favorite team after reading a short scenario about the player. The scenarios described the athlete as being gay or straight, and either becoming a distraction or not causing a distraction to the team. While males' ratings of the athlete did not significantly differ, female fans formed significantly more positive impressions of the gay male player than the straight athlete. These results are discussed in terms of the ingroup bias and the shifting culture of homophobia in sport. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - South Africans and Mexicans in Florida: Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1928250865
AB  - Newly arriving immigrants from Southern Africa and Mexicans do not get on well in the sunbelt state of Florida. A persistent theme emerging from discussions with South Africans on their relationship with Mexicans is that both sides perceive the other as culturally ethnocentric. The antagonistic relationship between both social groups is due to strong ethnic bonds and the clash of cultures.

T1  - Suburban Queer: Reading Grease
AN  - 870432825; 201114247
AB  - This article examines how nontraditional representations of gender can complicate received social norms, and it examines, in particular, how pre-adolescent suburban youth reconfigure social codes within popular film in order to identify positive queer aesthetics. While several studies have documented the function of classic and mainstream film in the tradition of queer reading, there has been comparatively less analysis devoted to the ways that filmic representations themselves might contribute to theoretical debates regarding sexual identity. As a case in point, this essay analyzes the 1978 musical Grease in order to suggest ways that critics might navigate between strict social constructionist and essentialist theories of sexual identity in order to identify avenues for queer identification within non-queer contexts.

T1  - Accuracy Of Slovak National Stereotypes: Result Of Judgment Or Intuition?
AN  - 964192548; 201207244
AB  - An international study comprising 3230 university students from Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria, Germany and Poland examined the accuracy of Slovak national stereotypes. The accuracy of stereotypes was evaluated comparing ratings of typical Slovaks from the ingroup as well as outgroup perspective with ratings of real people living in Slovakia. We found that Slovak national stereotypes rated by Slovaks did not correspond with ratings of real Slovaks. The ratings of real Slovaks corresponded more with the ratings of Slovak national stereotypes by members of other Central European countries. Our findings indicate that national stereotypes can be based upon reflective judgment of real people living in the given nation. At the same time, ratings of group characteristics can be biased by other motivations, e.g. the tendency to evaluate one's own group more favorably than outgroups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Europe of Homelands or Homeland Europe: (European) Identity Issues
AN  - 925712455; 201204231
AB  - This paper addresses identity issues in Europe in the context of the free flow of people within the European Union and therefore the creation and reinforcement of complex parallel individual and also collective identities. The authors' premises are current EU perspectives on migration and the interconnection of migration and identity issues. Based on the substantial body of literature on the topic, the authors confront various theorisations of collective identities with the political project on European identity, emphasising in particular European nationalisms, social and other identities in relation to European identity and the (ab)use of the latter as a political instrument. In the conclusion, the authors suggest key research issues to orient the scientific research in this field in the future. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Differences in Crisis Knowledge Across Age, Race, and Socioeconomic Status During Hurricane Ike: A Field Test and Extension of the Knowledge Gap Hypothesis
AN  - 896202467; 201120188
AB  - Previous research in crisis and risk communication has suggested differences across demographic groups in informational needs and response, including the presence of knowledge gaps. In the wake of Hurricane Ike, the current study surveyed 691 Houston area residents to investigate these differences and contrast them with similar data collected following Hurricane Katrina. The results suggest narrowing knowledge gaps, as socioeconomic status did not predict informational needs or preparations for the storm. Differences in these needs were still detected across sex and ethnicity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Being In The Frontline Of A Sami Culture And A Private Business: Cross-Border Reindeer Herding In Northern Norway And Sweden
AN  - 1030867162; 201227783
AB  - This article investigates a conflict that loomed over the mutual use of pastures on either side of the border by various Sami groups during the last decade. On the basis of a critical reading of Foucault, we analyse the identifications connected to different kinds of spaces that come up in the mediation of this conflict. Surprisingly, the notion of belonging to an indigenous people plays only a very limited role in this conflict. Being a Sami and a state citizen turns out to be more important. Reindeer pastures are perceived as lands, bounded spaces, and as part of the state space, since reindeer herding is a 'nationalised' business. However, pastures as concrete places in themselves have not emerged as an important aspect of this conflict. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1010632611; 201210549
AB  - This article explores the complexities encountered by Maori researchers working at the nexus of Maori and academic communities. We critique the ways in which power asymmetries and discourses of authenticity can prescribe a narrow, distorting view of what it means to be Maori, a social scientist, and a Maori social scientist. Illustrative examples are employed to show how these forces give rise to barriers in the form of closed ideologies, networks, and access to resources. We conclude by discussing the benefits of being both insider and outsider conducting research in "the space between". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inconsistent Latino Self-Identification in Adolescence and Academic Performance
AN  - 868012262; 201112919
AB  - Research has documented important connections between ethnic identity and academic success. In the multiethnic context of the US, ethnic self-identification is a dynamic process that develops through social interaction within institutions. Understanding the emergence of a Latino self-identity within schools can provide insight into the meanings adolescents confer to a Latino identity and the relationship between a Latino self-identity and academic success. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine (1) the association between a Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and academic well-being, (2) the association between a Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and school processes, and (3) whether school processes help to mediate the relationship between Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and academic well-being. Results suggest that while adolescents who identify as Latino at school but not at home come from families and neighborhoods with higher levels of economic and human capital, by the end of high school they have accumulated less educational capital then either consistently identifying Latinos or non-Latino whites. Much of this association can be explained by prior academic experiences, yet other factors associated with resistance to institutional norms and attending low performing schools may also be important. Results suggest that non-minority, underachieving adolescents may choose to self-identify as Latino in schools as a way to save face and avert identity crises and that perhaps youth in schools have come to associate a Latino identity with poor school performance.

T1  - Interobjectivity: Representations and artefacts in Cultural Psychology
AN  - 852898479; 201103132
AB  - This paper revisits the emerging concept of interobjectivity and furthers Moghaddam's (2003, 2006) proposal to prioritize this concept in Cultural Psychology. We argue that Heidegger's phenomenology provides insights into a foundational understanding of what interobjectivity entails. We argue that human relations are not essentially characterized by intersubjective relations but rely on the non-conscious engagement in practices that occur within a social field that is phenomenally objective for subjects. From the phenomenological point of view, the distinction between subjectivity and objectivity is a false one. Thus, we argue that the study of objects and object relations should be given greater attention in Cultural Psychology. To this end, we distinguish between two meanings of interobjectivity: (a) inter-objectivity as a description of object-relations; (b) interobjectivity as a description of a representation spanning different objectifications, and that permits diverse inter-objective relations. We claim that, taken together, these concepts provide a useful framework that can guide inquiry into cultural practices and intercultural relations.

T1  - A Multilevel Analysis of Interracial Relationship Characteristics Among Young Adults
AN  - 868013700; 201112939
AB  - Using retrospective data on relationship histories from Wave 3 (2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), I examined differences between interracial and same-race relationships within a multilevel framework (i.e., relationship histories nested within individuals). The results of this analysis generally supported patterns previously established in the literature through non-hierarchical regression analysis, and additionally provided estimates for the associations of interracial relationship involvement with sexual intercourse and partner age difference (two variables that have received little consideration in the past literature on interracial relationship characteristics). Results indicated that, while controlling for individual-level factors that have been shown to significantly impact interracial relationship formation, interracial relationships have significantly higher odds than do same-race relationships of also being same-sex relationships and of involving sexual intercourse. In addition, compared to same-race relationships, interracial relationship involvement is associated with a greater age difference between partners. Finally, interracial relationships have significantly lower odds than do their same-race counterparts of lasting 3 months or longer in duration, or of progressing to a marital or cohabiting status.

T1  - Migrant Entrepreneurship in Greece: Diversity of Pathways for Emerging Ethnic Business Communities in Thessaloniki
AN  - 743065947; 201043297
AB  - This paper examines aspects of immigrants' entrepreneurship in Greece, focusing on the emergence of distinct ethnic business communities by migrants from China, Nigeria, Albania and the former USSR. Beginning from a literature review, it overviews the policy context and official statistics in Greece and discusses recent fieldwork findings in Thessaloniki. The diversity of entrepreneurial strategies and practises is explained through a typology based on the prevailing characteristics of immigrant businesses. We suggest that the entrepreneurship of migrants is embedded within the dynamics of immigrants' integration and the broader factors on which this depends. This has important implications, calling for a realistic, coherent, inclusive and long-spanning migratory policy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Opposition to enlargement as a symbolic defence of group position: multilevel analyses of attitudes toward candidates' entries in the EU-25
AN  - 743048773; 201032736
AB  - Despite the sociological and geopolitical significance of EU enlargement and opinion toward it, extant literature is lacking a theory of enlargement opinion and an examination of opinion in the wake of the 2004 enlargement. This paper fills these gaps by developing a symbolic defence of group position model to explain opposition to the entries of candidate states (as of 2005: Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, and Turkey) and to examine how these explanations differ for post-Communist EU members. Results of hierarchical multinomial logistic models of Eurobarometer ( European Commission 2005) data from the EU-25 support the notion that the symbolic nature of enlargement shapes the effects of interests, threat, and other factors on opinion depending on candidates' position in a culturally and historically-rooted hierarchy of 'European-ness'. Attitudes toward Turkey's entry are less shaped by material interests than attitudes toward other candidates' entries, which is explained by Turkey's position at the bottom - and post-Communist countries' position in the middle - of this hierarchy in the post-Cold War era. Attitudes toward Turkey's entry are rather a function of the perceived threat that it poses to the group position and identity of Europeans, which is defended by the politically knowledgeable. While the lower levels of threat in post-socialist EU member countries help to account for their lower levels of opposition to candidates' entries, people in these countries to a greater extent use European identity as a way of symbolically distancing themselves from Turkey. Implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - On the robustness of the group reference effect
AN  - 743045209; 201026354
AB  - Extending the self-reference effect to the level of group identities, previous research has shown that participants' encoding of trait adjectives with reference to ingroups facilitates recall relative to a control condition in which judgments are made about adjectives' meanings. We contend that this experimental comparison may have exaggerated the extent of the group reference effect. Two studies are reported that examine this contention. In Study 1 participants encoded adjectives with reference to an ingroup, an outgroup or to its semantic properties. Study 2 was nearly identical but required that adjectives be encoded with reference to an ingroup, the personal self or a specific person other than the self. Notwithstanding the use of more stringent controls, both studies provided evidence for the group reference effect. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Anti-Gay Sentiment Among Adolescents in Belgium and Canada: A Comparative Investigation into the Role of Gender and Religion
AN  - 60370544; 201017513
AB  - Previous research has indicated that opposition toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trangender (LGBT) rights remains prevalent among Western populations. In this article, we investigate the determinants of anti-gay attitudes among adolescents in two liberal democracies, Belgium (n = 6,330) and Canada (n = 3,334). The analysis indicates that hostile feelings toward LGBT rights are particularly widespread among boys, while the effects of socioeconomic status and parental education remain limited. Various religious denominations proved to have a strong and significant negative impact on tolerance, with especially high scores for Islam. Religious practice, too, contributes to a negative attitude toward LGBT rights. The consequences of these findings with regard to tolerance for gay rights among Islamic youth in Western democracies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religion in the Face of Uncertainty: An Uncertainty-Identity Theory Account of Religiousness
AN  - 1928183670
AB  - The authors characterize religions as social groups and religiosity as the extent to which a person identifies with a religion, subscribes to its ideology or worldview, and conforms to its normative practices. They argue that religions have attributes that make them well suited to reduce feelings of self-uncertainty. According to uncertainty-identity theory, people are motivated to reduce feelings of uncertainty about or reflecting on self; and identification with groups, particularly highly entitative groups, is a very effective way to reduce uncertainty. All groups provide belief systems and normative prescriptions related to everyday life. However, religions also address the nature of existence, invoking sacred entities and associated rituals and ceremonies. They are entitative groups that provide a moral compass and rules for living that pervade a person's life, making them particularly attractive in times of uncertainty. The authors document data supporting their analysis and discuss conditions that transform religiosity into religious zealotry and extremism.
