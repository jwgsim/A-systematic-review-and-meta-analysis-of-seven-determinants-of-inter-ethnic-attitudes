T1  - Predicting support for community corrections: Crime type and severity, and offender, observer, and victim characteristics
AN  - 2672269522
AB  - The aim of the current research was to examine the contribution of crime type and severity as well as offender, observer, and victim characteristics to prediction of perception of community correction (CC) as an appropriate punishment. We conducted a telephone survey among Israeli citizens. A random and representative sample of 573 respondents, aged 20 to 74, evaluated the seriousness of crime scenarios and the appropriateness of CC for each scenario. In different versions of crime scenarios, we manipulated offence type as well as offender and victim characteristics. The results of a logistic regression indicate that perceived lower crime severity, a crime that is not murder, older offender age, and being a secular observer are related with an increased likelihood of supporting community corrections. The discussion addresses these findings in the context of punitive goals (e.g., revenge, retribution), public perception of offender dangerousness, and social identity theory.

T1  - “Be careful what you do”: How social threat influences social attention driven by reach-to-grasp movements
AN  - 2653430083
AB  - Social attention is the ability to share with social partners the attentional focus on an object and to orient attentional resources after observing others’ behaviors. In the present work, we analyzed whether social threat may influence social attention during the observation of social agents’ reach-to-grasp movements. In two experimental studies, we adopted a Posner-like paradigm: participants were required to classify neutral stimuli appearing in a congruent or incongruent position with the actor’s movement. Membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) and contextual cues (neutral vs. threatening objects) were manipulated. The results showed a robust action-cueing effect: responses to stimuli in a congruent position with the actor’s action were faster than responses to incongruent stimuli. Interestingly, we found a stronger effect for the threatening outgroup (i.e., Iraqi) than for the ingroup (i.e., Italian), especially in presence of menacing objects. No effects were found when observing the non-threatening outgroup (i.e., Japanese).

T1  - Support for rights of Syrian refugees in Turkey: The role of secondary transfer effects in intergroup contact
AN  - 2640325525
AB  - This study explored the role of secondary transfer effects (STEs) to test whether and how contact between advantaged Turks and disadvantaged Kurds may shape support for the rights of Syrian refugees. We investigated whether dimensions of contact, positive versus negative, between a historically advantaged group (Turks, n = 300) and a disadvantaged group (Kurds, n = 127), extend to a novel disadvantaged outgroup (Syrian refugees) via attitude generalization and as a function of the perceived threat from the novel outgroup. Controlling for the effects of contact with Syrian refugees, findings show that both positive and negative contacts with the primary outgroups are associated with support for policies benefiting the secondary outgroup, Syrian refugees, but these associations are moderated by perceived threats posed by the secondary outgroup. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research on secondary transfer processes of contact and for research on multiple group contexts.

T1  - North American Attitudes toward Immigrants and Immigration in the Time of COVID-19: The Role of National Attachment and Threat
AN  - 2614690274
AB  - Using a cross-national representative survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine predictors of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration in Canada and the United States, including general and COVID-related nationalism, patriotism, and perceived personal and national economic and health threats. In both countries, nationalism, particularly COVID-related nationalism, predicted perceptions that immigration levels were too high and negative attitudes toward immigrants. Patriotism predicted negative immigration attitudes in the United States but not in Canada, where support for immigration and multiculturalism are part of national identity. Conversely, personal and national economic threat predicted negative immigration attitudes in Canada more than in the United States. In both countries, national health threat predicted more favorable views of immigration levels and attitudes toward immigrants, perhaps because many immigrants have provided frontline health care during the pandemic. Country-level cognition in context drives immigration attitudes and informs strategies for supporting more positive views of immigrants and immigration.

T1  - Social media, protest, & outrage communication in Ethiopia: toward fractured publics or pluralistic polity?
AN  - 2495802010
AB  - In 2018, Ethiopia experienced a tectonic political shift following the culmination of years of public outcry against the now defunct ruling party, the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Protest groups, predominantly organized along ethnic identification, have used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to disseminate strategies, recruit members, and galvanize support. Anchored on theories of collective identity and moral outrage, this study investigates the role of social media platforms in mobilizing Ethiopians toward political reform during the protest and post-protest periods demarcated by the ascent of Abiy Ahmed as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Data generated from a mixed method approach consisting of an online survey and interviews indicate social media platforms played a crucial role by drawing Ethiopian youth to participate in political discourse, empowering formerly marginalized groups to influence policy, and fostering ingroup cultural/political cohesion. However, evidence indicates participation opportunities created by social media platforms also brought apprehension including the rise of outrage communication as manifested by inflammatory expressions, hate speech, and political extremism. By proposing outrage communication as a viable construct that captures this phenomenon, I argue, in the context of a polity embodying highly heterogeneous and competing collective identities – ethnic or otherwise – such as Ethiopia, social media platforms are likely to increase ingroup political participation but chronically diminish outgroup engagement.

T1  - Does the out‐group recognize our mental skills? Cross‐group friendships, extended contact, and the expectation of humanizing perceptions from the out‐group
AN  - 2439833472
AB  - Recent research has shown the negative effect of meta‐dehumanization: the perception that out‐group members deny a fully human status to the in‐group. So far, no strategies have been investigated that allow the improvement of humanity meta‐attributions. In this work, we focused on the two mind perception dimensions: agency (e.g., the capacity of planning actions) and experience (e.g., the capacity of feeling emotions), and investigated whether direct and indirect intergroup friendships are associated with the expectation that the out‐group will recognize our mental capacities. A survey was conducted considering the relationship between two regional groups in Italy (Northern and Southern Italians). Participants were Northern university students. A two‐level mediation model was tested, in which the exogenous variables were cross‐group friendship and extended contact, the first‐level mediators were IOS (the inclusion of the out‐group in the self mechanism), in‐group and out‐group norms, and the second‐level mediators were anxiety, empathy, and trust toward the out‐group. The dependent variables were the evaluations of agency and experience regarding one's group (Northerners) expected by Southerners. Models were estimated by path analysis with observed variables. To replicate prior findings, the attributions of agency and experience to the out‐group (Southerners) were also assessed. Results showed that both direct and indirect friendships are related to more positive meta‐attributions through the mediation of affective and cognitive factors. Findings have practical implications: contact may favor the expectation of being perceived both as moral agents and as moral patients, thus improving intergroup relations.

T1  - Critical incidents in the development of (multi)ethnic-racial identity: Experiences of individuals with mixed ethnic-racial backgrounds in the U.S.
AN  - 2390112444
AB  - Secure ethnic-racial identity (ERI) is tied to well-being, especially for minority individuals; however, there is still little consensus on the key processes and optimal outcomes of various multiethnic-racial (ME-R; i.e., individuals with parents from different ethnic-racial groups) identity development models. In this study, we examine the critical incidents in personal and social relationships that are central to ME-R identity development. Twenty-nine ME-R individuals provided retrospective accounts of incidents and conversations they self-perceived to be critical to their ERI development. Four major themes emerged: incidents and conversations surrounding intergroup contact, confrontation, heritage, and appearance were all recalled as critical to ME-R identity development. These findings highlight the importance of studying the ways that ERI is constituted through interaction with others. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - The Stakes of Symbolic Boundaries
AN  - 2558593872
AB  - Sociological theories of symbolic boundaries (understandings of who belongs to in-groups and out-groups) and social boundaries (material stratification) argue both are related, but empirical analyses often focus on one or the other. Using survey data from 2014, we replicate and validate earlier research describing patterns in how Americans draw symbolic boundaries against a range of minority groups. We then go beyond this work by demonstrating a new link between boundary-drawing and attitudes about inequality and civil liberties with material implications. Drawing symbolic boundaries is not a benign practice; rather, it is associated with willingness to draw social boundaries that support material and political inequality.

T1  - Stay away or stay together? Social contagion, common identity, and bystanders’ interventions in homophobic bullying episodes: GPIR
AN  - 2330295351
AB  - Two studies explored the link between social contagion concerns and assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions in homophobic bullying episodes. Study 1 (N = 216) examined if adolescents’ social contagion concerns (i.e., fear of being misclassified as gay/lesbian) relate to decreased behavioral intentions to help victims of bullying, by increasing negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men. Study 2 (N = 230) further explored if inclusive identity representations (i.e., one-group or dual-identity) were related to decreased concerns of social contagion, thereby increasing adolescents’ assertive behavioral intentions. Results (partially) confirmed both expected mediations: social contagion concerns were associated with decreased assertive behavioral intentions via increased negative attitudes towards lesbians and gay men (Study 1); one-group representations, but not dual-identity representations, were associated with more assertive behavioral intentions via decreased social contagion concerns (Study 2). These findings extended previous studies illustrating the underlying mechanisms through which social contagion concerns and common identity affect assertive bystanders’ behavioral intentions.

T1  - Religious visibility: perceptions and experiences of residents in two Muslim concentration suburbs in Melbourne, Australia
AN  - 2299735306
AB  - In recent decades, and especially after the 9/11/2001 terrorist attack on US, an antipathy towards and fear of Muslim minorities in Western countries have increased, forming part of the current widespread anti-immigration sentiment. In this context, the 'religiously visible' Muslims are the most obvious target of negative perceptions, discrimination and other manifestations of 'Islamophobia'. This paper uses quantitative and qualitative data on religious visibility collected through a survey and in-depth interviews in two suburbs with residential concentrations of Muslims in Melbourne, Australia. The two localities, 'Broadburb' and 'Greenburb', have similar proportions of Muslim residents (about 1/3) but the levels of religious visibility differ. The paper discusses perceptions and experiences of being religiously visible in a secular society, and particularly being a 'visible Muslim'. We also discuss perceptions of Muslim visibility by others - non-visible Muslims and non-Muslims - who share neighbourhoods with the visible Muslim minority.

T1  - Dual identification, multicultural identity styles, and intergroup evaluations: Some preliminary findings
AN  - 2317027068
AB  - The current study examines dual identification (i.e., identification with one's ethnic and national cultures) and cultural identity styles (i.e., the ways in which one negotiates ethnic and national identities) as predictors of intergroup evaluations in a sample of 228 Chinese New Zealanders. It was hypothesized that dual identification predicts more positive ingroup and outgroup evaluations, but also more ingroup bias. Furthermore, we expected that the Hybrid Identity Style (HIS), which reflects blending ethnic and national identities, is linked to positive ingroup and outgroup evaluations, but that the Alternating Identity Style (AIS), which involves shifting between these identities depending on the circumstances, is associated with negative ingroup and outgroup evaluations. We also predicted that HIS moderates the link between dual identification and ingroup bias. As expected, multiple regression analysis indicated that dual identification predicted more positive ingroup evaluation and greater ingroup bias, and HIS moderated these effects. A high level of HIS buffered the influence of dual identification on ingroup bias. HIS was positively, and AIS was negatively associated with both ingroup and outgroup evaluations. The results suggest that HIS is a promising route to positive intergroup relations.

T1  - Are today’s youth more tolerant? Trends in tolerance among young people in Britain
AN  - 2170172834
AB  - Attitudes towards social groups that have traditionally been marginalised or discriminated against have changed markedly in Britain over the past three decades. This change is particularly marked in attitudes towards homosexuality and racial diversity which, as public opinion surveys have regularly shown, have become more accepting over time. This change is often attributed to older, less tolerant generations being replaced by young cohorts who are more inclusive and open minded in their attitudes to cultural others. The paper explores this argument by examining trends in people’s attitudes towards a variety of minorities, including the said groups, but also immigrants and foreign workers. It starts with a discussion of several perspectives predicting different trends with regards to these attitudes. A distinction is made between optimistic ones (i.e. those anticipating rising levels of tolerance) and pessimistic ones (i.e. those expecting stable or declining levels of tolerance). Subsequently, the paper presents trend analyses and an analysis of age, cohort and period effects to broadly assess the explanatory power of these perspectives. Using these approaches, we find that tolerance towards racial minorities and homosexuality has indeed risen across the board, and that young people are also more accepting of these groups than their parents or grandparents and previous generations of young people. These trends broadly support the optimistic perspectives. However, we also find that prejudice has not disappeared from youth attitudes altogether; for a sizeable minority of youth, it has merely shifted its focus to immigration. Not only have unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants generally become stronger, young people are not always the most tolerant age group regarding this social group. These findings are thus more in line with the expectations of the pessimistic perspectives.

T1  - Racial inequality and the recognition of racial discrimination in Jamaica
AN  - 2110255566
AB  - A growing body of literature posits that a population's denial of the salience of racial discrimination acts as a mechanism of its perpetuation. Moreover, scholars locate a population's propensity to deny racial discrimination in contemporary ideologies of racial mixing or ethnic fusion. Most quantitative studies of public opinion on these issues are limited to Latin America and the Spanish-speaking Caribbean. This study examines the case of Jamaica. We first (1) examine the extent of Jamaica's contemporary racial inequality using national census data. We then (2) use nationally representative data from the AmericasBarometer social survey to determine the extent to which a recognition of racial discrimination characterizes Jamaican public opinion. Finally, we (3) explore the salience of an ideology of racial mixing in Jamaica and (4) test whether that ideology affects the likelihood that Jamaicans acknowledge contemporary racial discrimination. Our findings document dramatic social inequality by skin colour in Jamaica and suggest that a majority embrace an ideology that racial mixing is negatively associated with Jamaicans' recognition of racial discrimination. We discuss our findings and their implications for understanding ideologies of racial mixing and racial inequality in the Americas.

T1  - Race-ing solidarity: Asian Americans and support for Black Lives Matter
AN  - 2571083559
AB  - What explains support for Black Lives Matter among Asian Americans? This article draws on nationally representative data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey to examine the contours of Asian American public opinion on Black Lives Matter and the factors that shape them. Examining intragroup and intergroup attitudes across a set of racial, ethnic/national origin, and cross-racial group measures, I show that race-based considerations are significant predictors of Asian American support for Black Lives Matter. Specifically, I find that those who support Black Lives Matter are more likely to perceive linked fate with other Asian Americans and with other non-white groups and to perceive anti-black discrimination in the United States. I argue that, while never a panacea, race-based linked fate beliefs among Asian Americans, both as Asian Americans and with other groups of color, are a viable and imperative part of building cross-racial coalitions and contemporary racial justice movements.

T1  - Whither the diversity bargain?
AN  - 1930436593
AB  - In Natasha Warikoo's account, the "diversity bargain" is widespread among white elite American college students. This bargain is tentative support for preferences for underrepresented minorities in college admissions, conditioned on the admitted minority students providing white students with multicultural experiences that signal elite cosmopolitanism. This essay reviews three possible explanations for the pervasiveness of the diversity bargain: campus experiences with the benefits of diversity; socialization into expectations that elites give lip service to the benefits of diversity; and Warikoo's methodological and analytical choices.

T1  - The Intergroup Context of Environmental Education and Approaches to Facilitate Collaboration
AN  - 1928324707
AB  - An exploratory qualitative study examined how collaborations are fostered between newly formed small groups, comprised of individuals holding distinct in-group identities and differing in status. The study context was the environmental education (EE) field known to represent subgroups of educators using unique practices. Participants were environmental educators in a small group in each of three U.S. states, aiming to create inclusive collaborative partnerships. Insights from social identity theory and intergroup contact theory guided the analytical framework. Results highlighted the collaborative potential between professionals representing two subgroups: established EE and a relatively unknown community-focused EE. Insights on the process suggested employing strategies that respected subgroup differences in EE approaches and discussed them openly, enabled understanding of complementary ways to achieve a shared goal. Status differences between the subgroups seemed to influence how members of each group approached the partnership. Implications for using inclusive efforts to bring people together from diverse backgrounds are discussed.

T1  - Understanding the gap between reality and expectation: Local social engagement and ethnic concentration
AN  - 1923170558
AB  - It is widely known that there is a strong relationship between local ethnic concentration and local social engagement. This article attempts to take a step forward by analysing the gap between the real and the expected local social engagement and its association with local ethnic concentration. Understanding this gap may assist policy makers with better urban planning aiming for high social cohesion, particularly in those cities with high ethnic concentrations. Using the case of the Netherlands, this article finds a positive association between the real and the expected local social engagement, but this is higher for native Dutch people than for immigrants (i.e. Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans). This article also finds that as local ethnic concentration increases, Moroccans and Turks seem to meet their own expectations, but this effect is stronger for Moroccans. This is likely to indicate that an increase in local ethnic concentration assists Moroccans and Turks to maintain their cultural traditions, as they are able to derive benefits from each other and offer support to one another within a locality.

T1  - Labor Force Participation of Immigrant Women in the Netherlands: Do Traditional Partners Hold Them Back?: IMR
AN  - 1911516165
AB  - Female labor force participation (FLFP) rates often vary across ethnic groups. This study examined the role of the partner's labor market resources and gender role attitudes for FLFP in different ethnic groups. Cross-sectional data of women in partnerships from the four biggest immigrant groups in the Netherlands and from a native Dutch control group were analyzed. Traditional gender role attitudes of partners were negatively related to FLFP and partly explained ethnic differences therein. Moreover, across all groups, the relation between partners' labor market resources and FLFP was more negative for traditional women and rather absent for egalitarian women.

T1  - Black lives matter in Brazil
AN  - 1900934707
AB  - Michelle Lamont and her collaborators examine the experiences and responses of racialized minorities in confronting racism in the United States, Brazil and Israel. Among their findings, they find that while U.S. blacks often confront offenders, black Brazilians respond by ignoring or humouring them. They often do not understand such situations as racial because of Brazilian narratives that extensive miscegenation has diminished racism and that class may be the major culprit. The book's comparative approach permits them to leverage theoretical claims about race by examining it beyond the U.S. black-white experience. The authors interpret micro subjective experiences as responses to a macrocomparative context filtered through cultural repertoires, groupness and institutions. My main critique for Brazil is that conclusions are based on a highly selective sample of the educated elite in Rio de Janeiro.

T1  - "It's Almost Like They Were Happier When You Were Down": Microaggressions and Overt Hostility Against Native Americans in a Community with Gaming
AN  - 1888628528
AB  - In this article, we use qualitative data from 100 Native Americans living in mid-Michigan to document the changing nature of interactions between whites and tribal members. The community studied has seen significant changes in the economic and social position of the tribal community thanks to two decades of successful gaming operations. We find that, while Native Americans attest to positive changes in the community, many of which originate within the tribe itself, hostile and negative attitudes on the part of whites persist. Some of these contemporary attitudes are carry-overs of traditional anti-Native prejudice, while others reflect a reworking of old stereotypes to reflect new realities, while maintaining an unequal racial order. Hostile attitudes are accompanied by discriminatory behavior, often in the form of microaggressions. We suggest that, while old-fashioned racism has not disappeared, modern racism is more subtle and complex. While contemporary Native Americans react to and resist racism in a variety of ways, modern racist attitudes and the microaggressions that accompany them serve to reinforce an unequal racial status quo and the maintenance of a racial hierarchy of group positions.

T1  - Hostile Public Effect: Minority Status Mobilizing Political Participation
AN  - 2502808685
AB  - This study theorizes and tests the hostile public effect, according to which citizens who (a) actually are and/or (b) merely see themselves in a minority should be more participatory than those holding the dominant opinion. This study also tests whether it is citizens’ perceptions or their actual status that matters to political engagement. Furthermore, the hostile public effect is tested across three distinct issues and two participatory forms. Drawing on a nationally representative survey (N = 2,500) conducted in Spain, this study finds evidence for the mobilizing hostile public effect, with citizens who are actual minorities when it comes to their positions on abortion and immigration being more participatory than actual majorities. In turn, perceived minority or majority status does not matter to political engagement. These findings have various theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for public opinion scholarship.

T1  - Same-Sex Sexuality and Educational Attainment: The Pathway to College
AN  - 1865249450
AB  - Research finds lower levels of academic performance among sexual minority high school students, but some studies suggest sexual minorities have higher levels of educational attainment in adulthood. To further our understanding of how and why sexual orientation is associated with educational success, this study turns attention to the pathways to college completion, examining points along educational trajectories in which sexual minorities fall behind or surpass their heterosexual peers. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, we find that sexual minority women are less likely than women with no same-sex sexuality to complete college, in part due to their high school performance and transition into college. Men who experience same-sex sexuality only in adolescence struggle in high school, but men who experience same-sex sexuality for the first time in adulthood are more likely to earn a college degree than men who do not experience same-sex sexuality.

T1  - Predictors of Religiosity in a Cohort of African Americans
AN  - 1872753534
AB  - Few studies have considered life course predictors of religiosity. We use the Woodlawn Study of a cohort of 1242 first-grade African American children followed over four time periods to age 42 to observe how early school behaviors, family characteristics and neighborhood and social resources relate to later religiosity. Past literature suggested several domains of religiosity and exploratory factor analyses supported four measures of religiosity: religiosity as a resource, youth religiosity, divine struggle, and young adult religiosity. In multivariate analyses, males rated by teachers as shy in first grade, those with more than a high school education, and females who reported higher social ties in young adulthood were more likely to report religiosity as a resource at age 42. Males with both shy and aggressive behavior in first grade and females with lower math grades in first grade reported more youth religiosity. Those who obtained more education were less likely to report divine struggle. In terms of religiosity as a young adult, females who had been rated as both shy and aggressive in first grade, those living in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African Americans, those with higher social ties in young adulthood and those living in neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African Americans reported higher adult religiosity. Longitudinal studies offer an opportunity to examine how patterns of religiosity vary over the life course and how early family, school, and social adaptation influence later religiosity in adulthood.

T1  - Racial Discrimination, Religion, and the African American Drinking Paradox
AN  - 1872753529
AB  - African Americans are more likely to abstain from drinking than are Whites; yet, they are more likely than Whites to engage in problem drinking. The analysis uses data from the 1999-2000 National Survey of Black Workers (N = 1692), which is a nationally representative sample of currently employed and recently unemployed English-speaking African American adults. This article examines the link between discrimination, religion, and African American drinking behavior. The results from multinomial logit analyses show that those who experience more discrimination are significantly more likely to be social drinkers (vs. nondrinkers). At the same time, when controlling for other factors, those who experience more discrimination are significantly more likely to be problem drinkers. When religiosity is taken into consideration, it acts as a suppressor in the relationship between experience with discrimination and nondrinking, as those who experience more discrimination are significantly less likely to be nondrinkers (vs. social drinkers). The results also suggest that religiosity partially explains the relationship between discrimination and problem drinking. The implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Religious Involvement and the Black-White Paradox in Mental Health
AN  - 1872753526
AB  - Despite demonstrating poorer physical health profiles, African Americans experience similar or more favorable mental health than whites, an unexpected pattern given their relatively disadvantaged social status. Given higher levels of religious involvement, a predominant attribution for the black-white paradox in mental health is differential religious involvement (stronger levels of religiosity among African Americans) but little research explicitly tests this assumption. Differential religious importance may also explain the mental health paradox, given past findings that religion is a stronger aspect in the lives of African Americans relative to whites. Using data from the National Survey of American Life, I investigate the black-white mental health paradox in depressive symptoms across three dimensions (spanning 18 measures) of religious involvement-organizational religious involvement, non-organizational religious involvement, and church-based social support. Specifically, I test whether black-white differences in either religious involvement or the importance of religiosity can explain mental health advantage of African Americans. Despite remarkably higher levels of religious involvement among African Americans relative to whites, these differences do not explain the mental health paradox. There was also no evidence supporting the differential impact of religious involvement argument. Future research should explore both positive and negative coping, in addition to the role of intersectionality when studying this unexpected trend.

T1  - How Moral Perceptions Influence Intergroup Tolerance: Evidence From Lebanon, Morocco, and the United States
AN  - 1869634640
AB  - Intergroup boundaries are often associated with differences in moral codes. How does the perception of similarity and dissimilarity in moral worldviews influence tolerant relationships between members of different groups? We theorized that the relationship between perceived moral similarity and intergroup tolerance is domain specific. Specifically, because people treat autonomy values (e.g., caring for others, being fair) as denoting universal rights and obligations, but binding values (e.g., purity) as denoting rights and obligations that apply preferentially for their own group, perceived similarity on autonomy values should be more relevant than perceived similarity on binding values to intergroup tolerance. Here, we describe correlational and experimental evidence to support these predictions from studies carried out in Lebanon (with sectarian groups), in Morocco (with ethnic groups), and in the United States (with ideological groups). Implications for understanding intergroup relations and theories of morality are discussed.

T1  - The Boundaries of Latino Sport Leadership: How Skin Tone, Ethnicity, and Nationality Construct Baseball's Color Line
AN  - 1862124064
AB  - Ethnoracial minorities constitute a sizeable percentage of the U.S. labor force, but are underrepresented in top management positions. Research examining the leadership gap focuses primarily on blacks and whites without giving ample attention to Latinos, whose experiences differ greatly based on phenotype, birthplace, and citizenship. This research uses an intersectional approach to examine how these categories overlap to influence Latino leadership in Major League Baseball. Using records data and descriptive statistics, the study shows that skin color and nationality influence leadership opportunities more than ethnicity does. Americans from all ethnoracial groups are more likely to lead than foreign-born individuals. Regardless of ethnicity, white and light-skinned individuals are more likely to be pitchers, catchers, managers, coaches, and broadcasters while dark-skinned people are underrepresented in those roles. The data indicate that American-born and light-skinned Latinos have experiences similar to their white counterparts while foreign-born and dark-skinned Latinos merge into collective blackness. This hierarchal structure reinforces historical racialized meanings about race and points toward a racial classification system where individuals will be sorted based on multiple, overlapping categories.

T1  - Why do immigrants have longer periods of unemployment? Swiss evidence
AN  - 1861254545
AB  - Immigrant groups, especially those originating from non-European countries, tend to experience disadvantages in the labour market and to be overrepresented among the recipients of welfare benefits in many European countries. In the public debate, this outcome is sometimes explained with reference to migration-related factors such as weaker work values than natives (i.e., acceptability of remaining on benefits), smaller and lower quality of informal networks and lower levels of psychological well-being. Indeed, we find that these factors significantly influence unemployment duration in the expected direction. However, they explain only a small share of the overall disadvantage that some immigrant groups experience. We conclude that at least some of the large differences we observed in unemployment durations are likely to be due to other factors including discrimination by employers.

T1  - Segregation by race and income in the United States 1970-2010
AN  - 1832924376
AB  - A systematic analysis of residential segregation and spatial interaction by income reveals that as income rises, minority access to integrated neighborhoods, higher levels of interaction with whites, and more affluent neighbors also increase. However, the income payoffs are much lower for African Americans than other groups, especially Asians. Although Hispanics and Asians have always displayed declining levels of minority-white dissimilarity and rising levels of minority-white interaction with rising income, income differentials on these outcomes for blacks did not appear until 1990 and since then have improved at a very slow pace. Given their higher overall levels of segregation and income's limited effect on residential attainment, African Americans experience less integration, more neighborhood poverty at all levels of income compared to other minority groups. The degree of black spatial disadvantage is especially acute in the nation's 21 hypersegregated metropolitan areas. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X16302307]

T1  - Did the Difference Between Black and White Americans in Anger-Out Decrease During the First Decade of the Twenty-First Century?
AN  - 1816297537
AB  - Studies have found blacks in the USA report lower levels of anger-out and higher levels of anger-in than whites. However, most of the research on anger expression has been based on data from limited samples. The current study investigates the black-white difference in anger-in and anger-out in a sample representative of Americans aged 40 and older. Data are from the two most recent waves of the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) surveys. In 2001, the ACL assessed both outcomes, with anger-out re-assessed in 2011. Thus, individual-level change in anger-out can be investigated. Drawing on literature on "anger privilege," civility, the politicization of anger, and related topics, we develop and evaluate hypotheses about: (1) the race difference in anger-out over time, (2) race as a moderator of the gender difference in both forms of anger expression, and (3) the impact of controlling for perceived discrimination on anger expression. We find blacks to report greater expressive reticence with regard to their anger (i.e., anger-in) than whites in 2001. That race difference became nonsignificant when discrimination was controlled. The race difference in anger-out was of borderline significance in 2001 and became significant after discrimination was controlled. Longitudinal analyses show that the race difference in anger-out decreased over time. The rate that anger-out decreased by did not significantly differ by race. We discuss processes that that could contribute to our results. We also speculate about how current trends in political anger expression might be related to the patterns we observe.

T1  - Human rights: Protecting sexual minorities or reinforcing the boundaries of 'the closet'?
AN  - 1834955081
AB  - In this article we problematise the fact that human rights legislation, whether intentionally or otherwise, reinforces binary categories such as 'heterosexual' or 'homosexual'. This form of 'othering' highlights the incongruence between what the legislation offers and sexual minorities' lived experiences. We argue that human rights thus constitute a double-edged sword that may discourage 'coming out'. Our critique of human rights is based on the findings of a research project in which 1 086 pre-service teachers across six national public tertiary universities in South Africa participated in a survey and/or in focus-group discussions (FGDs). The survey findings suggested that participants see human rights as implying freedom, dignity and equality for all, irrespective of sexual identity. Yet, a closer analysis of the data revealed that gay and lesbian participants do not necessarily experience the freedom, equality and dignity entrenched in human rights documents. An analysis of the data from the FGDs supported this notion as it revealed homophobic 'othering' attitudes on the side of pre-service teachers. Finally, we reflect on the ways in which the boundaries of 'the closet' have been reinforced through the 'othering' of sexual selfhood and consider how pre-service teachers grapple with some of the complexities surrounding issues of sexual diversity in education contexts.

T1  - Partisanship, Dysfunction, and Racial Fears: The New Normal in Health Care Policy?
AN  - 1818672624
AB  - Partisan politics snarled both the passage and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This essay examines partisanship's effects on health policy and asks whether the ACA experience was an exception or the new political normal. Partisanship itself has been essential for American democracy, but American institutions were not designed to handle its current form -- ideologically pure, racially sorted, closely matched parties playing by "Gingrich rules" before a partisan media. The new partisanship injects three far-reaching changes into national health policy: an unprecedented lack of closure, a decline in the traditional political arts of compromise and bargaining, and a failure to define and debate alternative health policies. We can get a better sense of how far partisanship reaches by turning to state health policies. The highly charged national debate has migrated into some of the states; others retain the traditional politics of compromise and problem solving. There are preliminary indications that the difference lies in the dynamics of race and ethnicity. [web URL: http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/41/4/827.abstract]

T1  - Majority Educators in a United States Minority/Immigrant Public School District: The Case of Garden City, Kansas
AN  - 1797683194
AB  - Increasingly, immigrants are settling in rural "new destinations," where low-wage, low-skilled jobs have been created as part of a broad restructuring of the United States economy. This trend has spurred not only the rapid growth of many small towns but also their demographic, linguistic, and cultural transformation. Nowhere is this more evident than in Garden City, Kansas, a micropolitan community Stull has studied for three decades. This changing geography of immigration is manifest in its public schools, where four of five students are members of so-called minorities, many of them recent immigrants or refugees, and three of four are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. Studying educators' experiences in this unique district can enrich the otherwise generic notions of diversity that so often inform teacher educators and educational policy makers. This article is based on a five-month ethnographic study involving participant observation and in-depth interviews with administrators and teachers in Garden City's eighteen public schools. It also draws upon documents and interviews from previous research in 1988-1990. This in-depth, diachronic study offers valuable insights for other new destination micropolitan communities and their schools.

T1  - Making the Invisible Visible: The Yumans of the United States-Mexico Transborder Region
AN  - 1797683146
AB  - After the colonization and missionary period in the 18th century, the economic development propelled by Europeans and Americans in the 19th century, and the establishment of the new United States-Mexico border in 1848, the Yuman groups experienced a dramatic population diminishment and dispersion. This included integration into a cash economy and cattle culture and the fission of their traditional lineages into two different nationalities. The Yumans became "invisible" before the Indianist agencies of the government, as a stereotyped image of indigenous people. However, in recent years, the Yumans have reinvigorated their ethnic identity through transborder articulations. This article illustrates how a Yuman ethnogenesis is fueled by the transborder reencountering of fissioned Yuman lineages and the linkages between a growing ethnic self-reference and ethnicities of diverse origin. This article also shows how modern communication plays a central role in this process. Finally, making the invisible Yumans visible may help legitimize their territorial claims and ancestral rights over their land resources and assist their efforts for official recognition and government services.

T1  - Assessing the Impact of a Media-based Intervention to Prevent Intergroup Violence and Promote Positive Intergroup Relations in Burundi
AN  - 1784567762
AB  - The present study (N=1074) examined the impact of a theory-driven media intervention aimed at violence prevention and intergroup reconciliation in Burundi. We used a novel methodology utilizing audio-based surveys to assess attitudes related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation among community members. We conducted a propensity score analysis to estimate the causal effects of the intervention by examining differences between listeners and non-listeners of the radio dramas. The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, in-group superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood). However, listeners and non-listeners did not differ in obedience toward leaders or historical perspective taking; and the results for active bystandership, one of the main foci of the intervention, were mixed. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of the intervention sometimes depends on listeners' personal experiences of victimization. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - On the Social Foundations for Crimmigration: Latino Threat and Support for Expanded Police Powers
AN  - 1771276731
AB  - Objectives
Because of the merging of immigration control and criminal justice, or "crimmigration," state and local police increasingly drive interior immigration enforcement through the routine policing of crime. At the same time, growing evidence indicates that immigration is an ethnicity-coded issue that allows for the veiled expression of broader anti-Latino sentiments. Yet little research has examined whether public perceptions of either immigrants or Latinos influence support for police policies and practices that, in the context of crimmigration, may significantly shape immigration enforcement and, more broadly, may contribute to the subordination of Latinos. The current study addresses this research question.
Methods
The study draws on data from a recent nationally representative telephone survey and employs multivariate regression methods to evaluate whether perceptions of Latino economic and political threat are associated with support for granting police greater latitude in stopping, searching, and using force against suspects.
Results
This study provides the first evidence that, at least among Whites, perceived Latino threat is positively associated with support for expanding police investigative powers, especially the power to stop suspects based only on the way they look.
Conclusions
The results suggest that by increasing public support for aggressive policing, or, at minimum, by reducing opposition to discriminatory social controls such as police profiling, Latino threat perceptions may increase the political attractiveness and viability of crimmigration as a "solution" to the "Latino problem."

T1  - Muslims' religiosity and views on religion in six Western European countries: does national context matter?
AN  - 1784150900
AB  - This article investigates the impact of discursive and political opportunity structures on religiosity among Muslims and on perceived distance between Muslims and non-Muslims on the role of religion in society, making use of the EURISLAM-data-set (2010). We will focus on Moroccan, Turkish, Pakistani and ex-Yugoslavian origin samples of migrants of Muslim origin and a control group of non-Muslim majority group citizens for six participating countries (Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK). Our analysis does not show any impact of opportunity structures on Muslims religiosity nor on perceived differences between Muslims and non-Muslims.

TY  - JOUR
T1  - From Patrick to John F.: Ethnic Names and Occupational Success in the Last Era of Mass Migration
AN  - 1768188873
AB  - Taking advantage of historical census records that include full first and last names, we apply a new approach to measuring the effect of cultural assimilation on economic success for the children of the last great wave of immigrants to the United States. We created a quantitative index of ethnic distinctiveness of first names and show the consequences of ethnic-sounding names for the occupational achievement of the adult children of European immigrants. We find a consistent tendency for the children of Irish, Italian, German, and Polish immigrants with more "American"-sounding names to have higher occupational achievement. About one-third of this effect appears to be due to social class differences in name-giving, and the remaining two-thirds to signaling effects of the names themselves. An exception is found for Russian, predominantly Jewish, immigrants, where we find a positive effect of ethnic naming on occupational achievement. The divergent effects of our new measure of cultural assimilation, sometimes hurting and sometimes helping, lend historical empirical support to more recent theories of the advantages of different paths to assimilation. The effects of ethnic first names are also found for a restricted analysis of recognizably ethnic last names, suggesting that immigrants' success depended on being perceived as making an effort to assimilate rather than hiding their origins.

T1  - LESS ALTRUISM, MORE RACISM: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POSITIVE DEVIANCE AND RACIAL BIAS
AN  - 1899013075
AB  - The topics of racism, prejudice, and discrimination remain important issues within society, significantly impact individuals' lives in the United States, and assess continued bias within the social structure of society. Within the field of deviance, there remains continued research on the topic of positive deviance or altruism, which assesses an individuals' level of selflessness. However, there is presently no research which combines the topics of racial bias with the topic of positive deviance. This study examines the relationship of altruism relative to the study of racial bias using secondary data analysis from the 2002 General Social Survey. This data suggests there is a weak inverse relationship between racial bias and level of altruism. Individuals who are low on prejudicial attitudes tend to be higher on altruism, while individuals who are high on prejudicial attitudes tend to be low on altruism. This suggests these two approaches can be examined within the context of each other, which has not been considered within the academic research before.

T1  - 'Chinese-Mexicans' and 'Blackest Asians': Filipino American youth resisting the racial binary
AN  - 1784145236
AB  - This study provides a deeper understanding of the interracial connections not just between non-whites and whites, but among non-whites. Filipino American youth attending high school in New York City contended with a dominant bipolar racial discourse that marginalizes the racialized experiences of Asians and Pacific Islanders. However, instead of feeling invisible or marginalized, data point to how they negotiated a black-white racial discourse to decide when and how they enter dialogues about race. Filipino youth re-conceptualized this racial binary to position themselves on a continuum to form the racial 'middle ground' between blacks and whites. Importantly, rather than a racial hierarchy that places whites at the top, youth used discursive strategies to place themselves on a racial continuum that emphasizes the interconnectedness among racial minorities.

T1  - Applying a Socio-Ecological Framework to Thematic Analysis Using a Statewide Assessment of Disproportionate Minority Contact in the United States
AN  - 1753373674
AB  - Disproportionate minority contact (DMC) in the United States represents a critical social challenge to promoting the ideals and values of social justice. The ecological nature of DMC, a phenomenon emerging from the intersection of micro- and macro-level factors, necessitates the application of systems theories in understanding the issue and designing solutions to address it. This article illustrates the application of socio-ecological systems theory in thematic analysis, drawing associations across multiple systems between contributing factors to DMC in the juvenile justice system in North Carolina, USA. Analysis examined data from 6 focus groups comprised of 55 statewide stakeholders involved in the juvenile justice continuum. Application of socio-ecological systems theory in thematic analysis revealed structural and individual conditions associated with DMC, to include institutional racism demonstrated by biases present in stakeholders across schools and the juvenile justice system. The article presents ways in which micro to macro factors influence social challenges. Findings present an analytic strategy for constructing a practical model in qualitative research of contributing mechanisms to DMC and addressing issues of social justice in the United States.

T1  - Prevalence of Self-Care and Ambulatory Disability in Baby Boom and Generation-X Birth-Cohorts by Intersectional Markers of Social Stratification
AN  - 1749603556
AB  - Are differences in disability prevalence between individuals at the top and bottom strata of society a product of non-random processes? Under the assumption that genetic mutations are unlikely to account for the notable differences by makers of social stratification, the research presents a class, race, and then sex (CSR) hypothesis. The cross-sectional study, situated in the continental USA, uses information on 4,914,628 community-dwelling individuals from the Baby Boom (born 1951-1961) and Generation-X (born 1971-1981) birth-cohorts. When population-weighted, the sample is said to represent 96,639,980 of their counterparts. The data come from the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample 2008-2012 file. Findings indicate that intersectional markers of social stratification help explain the prevalence and risk of self-care and ambulatory disability as predicted by the CSR hypothesis. The analysis provides novel evidence for the plausibility of a "Mexican Paradox" for disability. Amongst those from the Generation-X birth-cohort, low-education Mexican-origin Latinos had lower risk of disability than low-education non-Latino whites. Ageing studies should consider using intersectional markers of social stratification.

T1  - Public Perceptions of the Stigmatization of Wrongly Convicted Individuals: Findings from Semi-Structured Interviews
AN  - 1750040986
AB  - Many exonerees report stigmatizing experiences and difficulties securing gainful employment post-incarceration. Although researchers have begun to investigate public perceptions of wrongful conviction, there remains a dearth of knowledge about public perceptions of exonerees. To provide insight into how the public perceives exonerees, face-to-face interviews were conducted with members (n=30) of a suburban city in South Central Ontario. Data analysis included a constructed grounded approach to reveal emergent themes in the transcripts. All interviewees acknowledged that wrongly convicted individuals are stigmatized by the public and that this can have negative effects in many of their lived experiences. In addition, findings of this exploratory study suggest that some interviewees, indirectly or directly, stigmatize exonerees in their responses while being interviewed-lending insight into how the public views and reacts to exonerees. Findings and policy implications are theoretically framed in Erving Goffman's (1963) seminal work on stigma. Implications include the potential role of research and education in informing community members, and all levels of government, about wrongful convictions in general, and the negative implications of stigma, in particular.

T1  - Ethnic and religious differences in the attitudes of people towards being 'British'
AN  - 1821722692
AB  - Negative rhetoric and policy regarding Muslims has been justified according to a perceived lack of integration into British society. However, this lack of integration has not been empirically established and remains poorly described. This paper explores whether there are variations in levels of 'Britishness' and perceptions of the compatibility between Britishness and other cultural/religious identities among different minoritized groups in England and Wales. It examines the impact of racialization and other forms of social and economic exclusion on ideas of Britishness, focusing on similarities and differences in a sense of access to forms of Britishness among migrant groups. Descriptive and multivariate analyses of Citizenship Survey data showed that 90 per cent of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Christians felt part of Britain. Muslims were more likely than Caribbean Christians to report a strong British identification and (along with Hindus and Sikhs) to recognize potential compatibility between this and other aspects of national identity. The strength of this feeling was associated with age, gender, generation and, importantly, risk of racist victimization. Greater recognition must be given to the impact of social exclusion on the ability of ethnic and religious minority groups to feel part of British society, and also to the strong claim to Britishness made by Muslim people in England.

T1  - Sources of Support for Immigration Restriction: Economics, Politics, or Anti-Latino Bias?
AN  - 1727700592
AB  - Are attitudes toward Latinos associated with public views of immigration policies more generally? In this study, we examine whether measures of derogation, disrespect, and discomfort toward Latinos shape support for restrictive immigration policies. We analyze the opinions of Anglo (non-Hispanic White) and African American respondents from the 2000 National Opinion Research Center (NORC) General Social Survey (GSS), which contained a special module on ethnicity and diversity issues. Our findings reveal that prejudicial attitudes toward Latinos (as measured by the derogation, disrespect, and discomfort variables) are the most consistently significant factors in shaping opinions about the number of immigrants to admit and the consequences of immigration. However, individual-level economic factors and group threat measures are insignificant. In addition, personal contact with Latinos is insignificant in the models. This study suggests that support for immigration restrictions stems in large measure from a common source: negativity toward Latinos. Policy opinions are therefore not solely shaped by evaluations of policy qua policy but also by attitudes toward the group most commonly associated with immigration.

T1  - Piecing Together the US Immigrant Detention Puzzle One Night at a Time: An Analysis of All Persons in DHS-ICE Custody on September 22, 2012
AN  - 1732752635
AB  - This paper analyzes a dataset of every person in the custody of the US Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (DHS-ICE or ICE) on September 22, 2012, and compares this data with an earlier analysis of a similar dataset on detainees in DHS-ICE custody on January 25, 2009. DHS-ICE provided the 2012 and 2009 datasets in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests from the Boston Globe and Associated Press. The paper sets forth findings related to: (1) the removal adjudication processes to which the detainees were subject; (2) the facilities in which they were held; (3) their length of detention; and (4) their criminal histories, if any. The paper argues that DHS-ICE should collect extensive data on detainees, make it broadly available on a consistent basis, and become more transparent and accountable to the public.

T1  - An Exploration of Racial Considerations in Partnered Fathers' Involvement in Bringing Up Their Mixed-/Multi-Race Children in Britain and New Zealand
AN  - 1727672340
AB  - This article considers how partnered fathers' involvement may be shaped by their understandings of the salience and impact of their children's racial belonging where fathers do not share the same race as their (biological) children. We draw on findings from a small-scale study of fathers with a partner from a different racial background living in Britain and New Zealand, to consider their involvement with their mixed or multi-racial children. Bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve White fathers in thinking about issues that they would not necessarily otherwise have to consider. It could, for example, mean that they supported their children 's access to minority cultural knowledge and challenge racism. Equally, bringing up mixed/multi-race children can involve fathers from racial minorities in thinking about racial considerations in different ways. Notably they may transmit racial pride and cultured history to help their children deal with prejudice from the father's own minority ethnic group as well as racism from Whites.

T1  - Structural and normative conditions for interethnic friendships in multiethnic classrooms
AN  - 1762012637
AB  - Interethnic friendships between students are important for harmonious intercultural relations at school. Drawing on research on intergroup contact and cultural distance between immigrant and non-immigrant groups, we examined how structural and normative conditions in the classroom context are associated with friendships between early adolescents with and without an immigrant background in ethnically heterogeneous schools. The sample comprised 842 students (Mage = 11.50 years, SDage = .71; 53% male) attending multiethnic schools in Southwest Germany. Results revealed that perceived positive contact norms in class and perceived cultural distance predicted friendships between immigrant and non-immigrant students in both groups, even when the ethnic composition of the classroom was taken into account. The associations were largely the same for immigrants and non-immigrants. We conclude that interventions to foster interethnic friendships should aim to reduce perceptions of cultural distance and monitor and improve contact norms in intergroup settings.

AB  - In recent years, Mommy Wars discourse, or an expressed judgment between mothers who work for pay and those who stay at home with their children, has emerged as a significant part of American culture. Yet knowledge about both its substantive underpinnings and the breadth of its influence across racial groups is limited. On these points, some research has suggested that racial differences regarding adherence to particular mothering ideologies will drive Mommy Wars discourse among white, middle-class mothers but not among African American, middle-class mothers. This study investigates 125 middle-class yet racially diverse mothers about the content and prevalence of Mommy Wars discourse among their peers. Contrary to expectations, Mommy Wars discourse, although based on strong beliefs regarding appropriate maternal practices, was limited in its scope. In addition, Mommy Wars discourse was a minority perspective among the peers of white, middle-class mothers, but a plurality perspective among the peers of African American, middle-class mothers.

T1  - Looking beyond ethnicity: the negotiation of Chinese Muslim identity in Penang, Malaysia
AN  - 1680153052; 201514104
AB  - The conflation of ethnic and religious identities, particularly that of Malay and Muslim, has long historical and political roots in Malaysia. Being one of the most safeguarded identity marks in Malaysia, Islam has become part of the core of Malay ethnicity and plays a prominent role in ethnic politics. Muslim converts from ethnic minorities, such as the Chinese and Indians, are therefore faced with social expectation and pressure to 'become Malay'. This paper discusses the difficulty and improbability of Chinese Muslim identity in the previous literature and the recent development that enables the decoupling of religious and ethnic identities. By looking beyond ethnicity, the most salient social divider in Malaysia, and looking into other possibilities, such as religious identity, this paper aims to paint a picture of social relations and identification that is more complex yet flexible amongst the Chinese Muslim converts in Penang.

T1  - Ethnic Income Disparities in Israel
AN  - 1667948779; 201509600
AB  - This article analyses income inequality in Israel and the role of ethnicity in creating or explaining it. It shows that in spite of relatively large 'raw' disparities in mean incomes across the ethnic groups, when controlling for other non-ethnic factors it is not generally the case that Arabs underperform in the Israeli labour markets compared with Jews, and in some cases Arabs outperform Jews, especially for men. Returns on education also do not appear to be lower for Arabs, other things being equal. In spite of the stereotypes, Ashkenazim generally do not outperform Mizrahim, or at most do so to a very small degree. The main 'advantaged' ethnic group are the native-born sabra Israelis. The main 'disadvantaged' demographic group are recent immigrants. Somewhat surprisingly, Ethiopians do not underperform compared with other immigrants, other things being equal.

T1  - Are There Relationships Among Racial Segregation, Economic Isolation, and Proximity to Green Space?
AN  - 1732763061
AB  - Prior research has investigated differences in exposure to green space between racial and economic groups across the US. Results have generally shown that people of color and lower-income groups tend to live in neighborhoods with less green space than their more-advantaged counterparts. The research extends existing studies by measuring the association between racial and economic differences in exposure to green space and racial or economic segregation across neighborhoods within cities. Findings show that cities with lower levels of racial segregation exhibit smaller racial disparities in exposure to green space. By contrast, in cities with greater racial segregation, white people tend to live in neighborhoods with more green space than do people of color. This difference is more pronounced between white and Hispanic people. Finally, there is a strong association between segregation among different income groups and differences in exposure to green space between lower- and higher-income people.

T1  - Political Violence and Adolescent Out-group Attitudes and Prosocial Behaviors: Implications for Positive Inter-group Relations
AN  - 1667953694; 201512962
AB  - The negative impact of political violence on adolescent adjustment is well established. Less is known about factors that affect adolescents' positive outcomes in ethnically divided societies, especially influences on prosocial behaviors toward the out-group, which may promote constructive relations. For example, understanding how inter-group experiences and attitudes motivate out-group helping may foster inter-group co-operation and help to consolidate peace. The current study investigated adolescents' overall and out-group prosocial behaviors across two time points in Belfast, Northern Ireland (N = 714 dyads; 49% male; Time 1: M= 14.7, SD= 2.0, years old). Controlling for Time 1 prosocial behaviors, age, and gender, multi-variate structural equation modeling showed that experience with inter-group sectarian threat predicted fewer out-group prosocial behaviors at Time 2 at the trend level. On the other hand, greater experience of intra-group non-sectarian threat at Time 1 predicted more overall and out-group prosocial behaviors at Time 2. Moreover, positive out-group attitudes strengthened the link between intra-group threat and out-group prosocial behaviors one year later. Finally, experience with intra-group non-sectarian threat and out-group prosocial behaviors at Time 1 was related to more positive out-group attitudes at Time 2. The implications for youth development and inter-group relations in post-accord societies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - It is possible to partially order cities according to the informativeness of neighborhoods about their ethnic groups. It is also possible to partially order cities with two ethnic groups according to the Lorenz criterion. We show that a segregation order satisfies four well-established segregation principles if and only if it is consistent with the informativeness criterion. We then use this result to show that for the two-group case, the Lorenz and the informativeness criteria are equivalent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'That's When the Neighborhood Went South': How Middle Class Blacks and Whites Police Racial Boundaries of Stigmatized Blackness
AN  - 1660021009; 201505570
AB  - Drawing on evidence from a case study of a racially transitioning suburb of Chicago, we argue that both blacks and whites discursively form, maintain, protect, and navigate contradictory class and racial identities. The interactions between race and class are complex, but how do these complexities manifest themselves? We contend that racial groups utilize discursive storytelling to maintain boundaries, and that this is one of the ways in which racial and class inequalities are created and preserved. Furthermore, we explore the interworking of race and class, focusing on how class location helps mediate self-proclaimed middle class blacks' and whites' discourse on stigmatized forms of blackness. We conclude with a discussion of the sociological implications of this boundary maintenance, focusing on the ways in which whites and blacks in the middle class utilize various forms of capital to preserve status and power.

T1  - Measuring urban sexual cultures
AN  - 1680151800; 201513606
AB  - Gay neighborhoods across the United States are de-concentrating in today's so-called 'post-gay' era as sexual minorities assimilate into the mainstream and disperse across the city. This context creates a problem of measurement. If by 'culture' we mean to say a particular way of life of a group or subgroup of people like sexual minorities, and if that way of life is blending with other aspects of the metropolis, then how can we detect distinct urban sexual cultures? In this article, I use 125 interviews with Chicago residents to propose a two-pronged strategy. First, gay neighborhoods continue to house anchor institutions, despite ongoing residential out-migrations. These are the primary engines of community building, and they locate the material culture of a group in a specific place. Commemorations serve as a second indicator for a culture, and they too put meanings into form. Although it is a fact of city life that all neighborhoods change, anchors and commemorations are analytic devices that scholars can use to observe urban sexual cultures. More generally, they provide a framework for how to measure the shifting geographic profile of a historically stigmatized group as it experiences positive change in public opinion.

T1  - Representation Despite Discrimination: Minority Candidates in Germany
AN  - 1708525502; 201528685
AB  - Immigrant-origin minorities are underrepresented in many democratic legislatures. This paper evaluates the direct effects of voter discrimination on the electoral performance of minority political candidates in Germany. Using evidence from both a survey experiment and actual election data, the paper tests two mechanisms of discrimination-negative attitudes toward minority groups and assumptions about candidate ideology-and shows that neither results in a substantial penalty for the small numbers of minority candidates who actually compete for office. Minority candidates in Germany typically run for political parties that discriminating voters would not have supported in any case. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Invention of a Nation: The Druze in Israel
AN  - 1700674604; 201526321
AB  - Ethnic and national identities are shaped and evolve in the context of complex negotiations sustained among multiple players, each with its own and often contradicting interests. This study focuses on one unique cultural group, the Druze in Israel, and examines a multifaceted identity constructed as a direct result of policies and expectations of members and institutions of majority groups. My aim is to explore how this identity is defined within the complex intergroup context, the various components and their inter-relations (congruent or conflictual), and the way its boundaries are shaped through interaction with other identities in Israel. The analysis of the interviews conducted with 50 Druze university students in Israel yielded three major content categories: 'Druze by blood;' 'Arab, but less so;' and 'Being Israeli.' The Druze identity is constructed in primordialist terms, and a central role is assigned to the belief in reincarnation. The Arab identity is categorized primarily as a national one, and it is strongly affected by the negative attitude of Arabs toward the service of the Druze in the Israeli army. Three major aspects emerged in relation to the Israeli identity of the Druze: the fact of their being citizens of the State of Israel, the attitude of the state and of Jews toward them, and the army service. Our study portrays a highly complex and problematic constellation of group identities, shaped as a delicate adaptation to the unique position of a group subject to multiple political forces in the past and present.

T1  - Continuity and Change in Australian Racism
AN  - 1550999916; 201428980
AB  - In Australia, while there is no doubt that we have seen newly ethnicised and/or racialised groups arriving and new communities forming, what is new and what is old about the racisms that mar the Australian social landscape is not clear. And it is definitely worth thinking about. The author argues that Australia has seen a shift from 'numerological racism' to 'existential racism.' He then explores the form in which Australian racism is delivered, citing Pauline Hanson as an example. He then discusses 'the removal of the space of commonality' as a new development in Australian racism. Finally, he discusses the rise of what he calls 'racist anti-racism' within some sections of racialised ethnic groups in Australia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes towards code-switching among adult mono- and multilingual language users
AN  - 1531934647; 201424636
AB  - The present study investigates inter-individual variation (linked to personality traits, multilingualism and sociobiographical variables) in attitudes towards code-switching (CS) among 2070 multilinguals. Data were collected through an online questionnaire. We found that high levels of Tolerance of Ambiguity (TA) and Cognitive Empathy (CE), and low levels of Neuroticism are linked with significantly more positive attitudes towards CS. Knowing many languages had a marginally positive effect. A more fine-grained analysis revealed that participants with mid-range global proficiency values were less positive towards CS than those at the lower and higher end of the scale. Participants who grew up in a bilingual family and in an ethnically diverse environment, and currently worked in an ethnically diverse environment had significantly more positive attitudes towards CS. Female participants and those with the lowest and highest levels of education appreciated CS most, and participants in their teens and twenties appreciated CS less than older participants. The findings thus show that the attitudes towards CS are linked to personality, language learning history and current linguistic practices, as well as some sociobiographical variables.

T1  - Neighbourhood Attachment in Ethnically Diverse Areas: The Role of Interethnic Ties
AN  - 1531930768; 201423282
AB  - This article examines the relationship between ethnic diversity in the neighbourhood and attachment to it, while addressing the role of interethnic relations-both within and beyond the neighbourhood-and differentiating between native and migrant residents. The analyses rely on data from an international research project conducted in 2009/10 among residents of ethnically diverse areas in six European cities: Bilbao, Lisbon, Rotterdam, Thessalonica, Vienna and Warsaw. The obtained results confirm earlier findings as regards the general negative association between ethnic diversity and neighbourhood attachment, but more importantly, reveal that having interethnic relations moderates this relationship differently for natives and migrants. Ethnic diversity does not erode neighbourhood attachment for natives who have ties with people of other ethnicities, or for migrants with mono-ethnic ties. This pattern is explained by the different meaning that a diverse setting has for natives and for migrants. Possible implications of these findings are also discussed.

T1  - From Rags to Restaurants: Self-Determination, Entrepreneurship and Integration amongst Muslim Immigrants in Newcastle upon Tyne in Comparative Perspective, 1960s-1990s
AN  - 1559004091; 201431962
AB  - This article will provide a long-term assessment of Britain's relatively liberal (albeit constrained after 1962) immigration policy through an investigation of ethnic minority self-employment in Newcastle upon Tyne. It will offer an examination of immigrant experiences at grassroots level with regards to the employment sector and a reassessment of ethnic minority integration situated within a Western context. It will trace the development of entrepreneurship amongst Newcastle's Muslim immigrant community from its arrival in Britain through to its emergence as a fixed attribute on the city's landscape. A comparison with the German city of Bremen helps expose the long-term legacies of immigration histories and policies, and the role that Islam plays in determining levels of ethnic entrepreneurship. By drawing upon government documents and correspondence, Census material and a wide array of secondary literature, this article asserts that the literature focusing on immigrant aspirations and self-determination in the British labour market during the post-Second World War period needs revising.

T1  - Power, negotiations, and the anticipation of intergroup encounters
AN  - 1644755532
AB  - This review places intergroup encounters in a broad framework which considers the context in which such encounters take place, and in particular, the power dynamics at play. We address different forms of encounters, spanning from interpersonal interactions (not focused on intergroup aspects) to political negotiations between the groups' representatives, and argue for a deeper consideration of power asymmetries in examining such encounters. We argue that because high- and low-power group members have different motivations for change in the status quo, they differ in their expectations from intergroup encounters and in the types of encounters they prefer. We describe relevant research while considering moderating factors such as the legitimacy and stability of the power dynamics. We also identify remaining gaps and topics requiring further research. This work has both conceptual and practical implications for the prospects of promoting both positive attitudinal change as well as changes to the hierarchical status quo.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF TELEVISION VIEWING, CULTURAL PROXIMITY, AND ETHNOCENTRISM ON COUNTRY IMAGE
AN  - 1531931305; 201423187
AB  - We explored the effect of viewing Korean drama miniseries television programs, along with cultural proximity and ethnocentrism, on Japanese and Chinese television watchers' perceptions of Korea. By conducting a survey in Beijing and China with 621 valid samples, we confirmed the effect of viewing Korean drama miniseries television programs in shaping a positive attitude toward Korea. Furthermore, this positive attitude yielded higher levels of behavioral intentions such as visiting Korea or buying Korean products. Cultural proximity was also found to be a significant variable in predicting positive attitudes toward Korea. However, contrary to the findings in previous studies, in this study the effect of ethnocentrism was not significant. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inter-ethnic processes in post-Soviet space: theoretical background
AN  - 1512219146; 201408923
AB  - This introductory article of a special issue outlines the general theoretical background, formulates principles for a continuum of hot and cold ethnicities, gives a brief characterisation of the interethnic developments after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and provides an overview of the papers. This collection of contributions deals with a variety of case studies with a particular focus on the strength of members' emotional attachment to their group. Such a division of ethnicities can be categorised into two prototypes: 'hot' and 'cold'. A 'hot' ethnic group is one whose members have a high emotional attachment to their group. 'Cold' ethnic groups are those whose members' emotional attachment to the groups is low, absent or latent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - On the Edges of Belonging: Indian American Dalits, Queers, Guest Workers and Questions of Ethnic Belonging
AN  - 1494300433; 201401971
AB  - Questions of assimilation and belonging remain as important themes in the immigration and ethnicity literature. Most research focuses on ethnic groups and their sense of belonging to the societies they live in, with less attention given to processes that affect belonging among ethnic subgroups. Using primary and secondary data, we examine cases of three Indian-origin groups -- Dalits, Queers and Guest Workers -- in the USA to discuss the structures that shape belonging of Indian Americans, particularly those in these subgroups. Drawing on the notion of dynamic multi-layered ethnicities, we discuss the intersections of race/class/caste/sexuality/gender that structure their belonging. We argue that focus on the entire ethnic group is insufficient for analysing the factors that shape belonging; instead, we posit that examining how the social location of the main ethnic group intersects with the structural positions of subgroups is crucial to discussions of the concept of belonging.

T1  - Ethnicity and social cohesion in the post-Soviet Baltic states
AN  - 1448992675; 201342898
AB  - This article examines the efforts of post-Soviet Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to promote social cohesion by addressing the ethnic and linguistic cleavages that are part of the legacy of Soviet rule. In examining the particular situation of each Baltic state and the response to international pressure for integration and social inclusion policy, Muiznieks, Rozenvalds and Birka note the roles of threat-perception, the historic context, the linguistic and citizenship policy, as well as socio-economic inequality, in facilitating Russian-speakers' sense of belonging to their respective Baltic state. While ostensibly aimed at fostering a sense of belonging to the national state, Baltic integration and social inclusion policy has often had a contradictory effect, especially in Estonia and Latvia, where the emphasis on the majority language and culture as a prerequisite for access to citizenship and formal membership has enhanced the threat-perceptions of minorities, and led to their alienation or identification with the external homeland of Russia. In Lithuania, early inclusion of minorities into the polity has had a beneficial long-term impact in terms of their identification with their country of residence, demonstrated by the fact that Russian-speakers express a greater sense of belonging to Lithuania. A review of the available survey data on the Baltic states suggests that the same cannot be said for Estonia and Latvia, where minorities express a weak sense of belonging to the state. This suggests a challenging road ahead for Estonia and Latvia in achieving social cohesion, understood by minorities as a sense of membership in the community and feelings of mutual recognition. Furthermore, all three Baltic states, Latvia in particular, have yet to address growing socio-economic inequality, which threatens to cause long-term difficulties for social cohesion.

T1  - Learning orientation as a predictor of positive intergroup contact
AN  - 1429627964; 201335584
AB  - Adapting the goal orientation framework from the achievement motivation literature, the present research tests whether learning orientation, as compared to performance orientation, predicts greater comfort and interest in intergroup contact. These links are examined in a cross-sectional survey of European American and African American middle school students (Study 1), and in a longitudinal survey with European American high school students (Study 2). Both studies yielded converging evidence that while performance orientation generally had a negative association with comfort and interest, a stronger orientation toward learning predicted greater comfort and interest in intergroup contact. The links between the learning orientation and comfort and interest in intergroup contact were consistent across both racial groups in Study 1, and in longitudinal analyses in Study 2. Together, these findings point to learning orientation as a potentially important means for promoting positive intergroup contact.

T1  - Unauthorized Immigration to the United States: Annual Estimates and Components of Change, by State, 1990 to 2010
AN  - 1531932761; 201423396
AB  - We describe a method for producing annual estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population in the United States and components of population change, for each state and DC, for 1990-2010. We quantify a sharp drop in the number of unauthorized immigrants arriving since 2000, and we demonstrate the role of departures from the population (emigration, adjustment to legal status, removal by the Department of Homeland Security [DHS], and deaths) in reducing population growth from one million in 2000 to population losses in 2008 and 2009. The number arriving in the U.S. peaked at more than one million in 1999-2001 and then declined rapidly through 2009. We provide evidence that population growth stopped after 2007 primarily because entries declined and not because emigration increased during the economic crisis. Our estimates of the total unauthorized immigrant population in the U.S. and in the top ten states are comparable to those produced by DHS and the Pew Hispanic Center. However, our data and methods produce estimates with smaller ranges of sampling error. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ingroup Favoritism and Outgroup Derogation: Effects of News Valence, Character Race, and Recipient Race on Selective News Reading
AN  - 1448992638; 201342786
AB  - This study examined whether the positive or negative valence of a news story, and the race of the character portrayed in the story, would influence Black or White readers' selection of a story. The study employed selective exposure methodology to unobtrusively measure story selections among Black and White readers as they browsed a news site. The results demonstrated Black newsreaders were more likely to select and read positive and negative stories featuring their racial ingroup, and more likely to select and read negative vis-a-vis positive stories about their outgroup. In contrast, Whites' story preference was not affected by story valence or character race. Theoretical assumptions from social identity, social comparison, and social cognitive theories are used to explain the findings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can religious affiliation explain 'ethnic' inequalities in the labour market
AN  - 1438561076; 201340227
AB  - The disadvantage experienced in the labour market by the ethnic groups currently in Britain has long been established. This study builds on earlier research by exploring how far religious affiliation can explain these inequalities. Distinguishing the effects of ethnicity and religion is difficult for both conceptual and technical reasons, due to the 'identification' problem. We therefore estimate the effects by focusing on cases where ethnicity and religion cross-cut each other, excluding those groups where ethnicity and religion coincide. The results demonstrate a strong 'Muslim penalty' for both women and men from different ethnic groups with respect to economic activity and unemployment. Furthermore, the apparent 'ethnic' effects estimated for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in models that do not control for religion prove to be similar in magnitude to the effect of Muslim religion estimated in models from which Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have been excluded.

T1  - Explaining African ethnic diversity
AN  - 1429639779; 201335732
AB  - The consequences of ethnic diversity in Africa have been widely noted. However, the sources of this diversity remain unexplained, which is surprising in light of Africa's high level of ethnic diversity as well as its large internal variation. Here I show that ethnic diversity in Africa is a result of its tropical location, the pre-colonial slave trade, the colonial creation of large states, and low levels of urbanization, and that my results are robust to various controls. I also show that controlling for the slave trade eliminates the statistical significance of an Africa dummy variable in regressions using data on global ethnic diversity.

T1  - Do We Need Social Cohesion in the 21st Century? Multiple Languages of Belonging in the Metropolis
AN  - 1438555468; 201340287
AB  - Discussions about belonging, national identity and social cohesion are part of a broader debate that emerges from a number of concerns, mainly to do with identity and specifically with ethnic or religious identities versus the perceived homogeneous national identity. One major concern in immigration countries is that many immigrants and ethnic minorities are not integrating into the destination or receiving societies. This perceived lack of integration creates fears about whether newcomers are developing a shared sense of belonging to the national identity. Without this commitment it is feared that social cohesion and indeed the very basis of liberal democracy is under threat. In this paper, I question whether this fear is valid by exploring the relationship between the individual and society through the notion of 'sense of belonging' -- to a community, to a polity and to the nation. What does this mean in terms of national identity and social cohesion? In other words, do we have to have a shared sense of belonging to the nation to be responsible citizens? First, I will briefly explore some of the theoretical debates about belonging to the nation. Second, by analysing immigrant narratives on citizenship, belonging and community in London, I examine the multifaceted modes of belonging and whether migrants and ethnic minorities, who do not have a sense of belonging to the nation or who have a sense of belonging to more than one symbolic or material locality, can still have a sense of belonging and commitment to the common good which in turn contributes to societal cohesion.

T1  - Oscar Handlin and the Problem of Ethnic Pluralism and African American Civil Rights
AN  - 1364701923; 201323536
AB  - As the nation grappled with African American civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s, historian Oscar Handlin, like many scholars of his generation, set out to make sense of the role of race in American democracy and to determine the proper path of black liberation. Handlin, already a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of immigration, viewed both civil rights and the experiences of American blacks through a lens of ethnic pluralism. Like many historians and social scientists following the Second World War, Handlin rejected race as an analytical category, asserting in Race and Nationality in American Life (1957) "that there is no evidence of any inborn differences of temperament, personality, character, or intelligence among the races." Instead, he argued that ethnicity was "The only meaningful basis on which one can compare social and cultural traits." The notion that American society was composed of disparate ethnic groups with their own particular cultural affinities resonated with liberal social scientists and historians of the 1950s and 1960s for a number of reasons. Ethnic pluralism was, of course, consistent with models of interest group politics that had gained primacy following the New Deal. More to the point, in identifying culture as the nexus of group identity, ethnic pluralism constituted a formal rejection of eugenics and other biological metaphors of race. Handlin's identification of African Americans as an ethnic rather than racial group would ultimately lead him to draw fairly optimistic conclusions about the future of American race relations.

T1  - The Paradox of Integration: Immigrants and Their Attitude Toward the Native Population
AN  - 1494749224; 201401940
AB  - This study, conducted in The Netherlands, examines the "paradox of integration" proposition by focusing on the relationship between educational attainment and immigrants' attitude toward the native population. We found that educational level is related to this attitude in two opposite ways. On the one hand, better educated immigrants had more voluntary contact with the native population, and more contact was associated with a more positive attitude, partly because of higher perceived acceptance and lower perceived discrimination. On the other hand and independently of contact, better educated immigrants had a less positive attitude toward the native population because of lower perceived acceptance and higher perceived group discrimination. The latter findings support the paradox of integration proposition. The pattern of results was quite similar for four different immigrant groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ingroup Identification and Evaluations of Confessions from Ingroup and Outgroup Members
AN  - 1494749194; 201401949
AB  - We examined the role of ingroup identification in people's responses to confessions by ingroup versus outgroup members. Across two studies, participants were exposed to ingroup or outgroup members who confessed to an offence against the ingroup or outgroup. The targets made their confessions either with remorse or with no remorse. Participants' levels of ingroup identification were also assessed. Across our studies, we found that participants felt more favorable toward an individual who confessed with remorse versus no remorse. We also found that participants felt more favorable toward an outgroup confessor compared to an ingroup one. Finally, we found that high identifiers were more willing to forgive an outgroup perpetrator who confessed to an offence against their own group with no remorse. Our results indicate that people's responses to ingroup versus outgroup confessions are partly influenced by their group membership and levels of identification. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From A Plate Of Mixed Appetizers Toward A Melting Pot? Academic Debates On China's Current Ethnic Policies
AN  - 1463013006; 201345886
AB  - Large-scale ethnic unrest in recent years has instigated heated debates among Chinese intellectuals as well as the wider public about the suitability of current PRC ethnic policies. This article is an attempt at an introductory critique of the views of certain notable academics on this issue. A brief outline of the development of Chinese ethnic policy in the 20th century is followed by an overview of the arguments of sociology professor Ma Rong, the main proponent of abolishment of ethnic minority rights. The views of those who support the current policies are then briefly summarized. The article concludes with a critical examination of both positions, expressing support for the introduction of proper self-governance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Shades of Faith: Religious Foundations of Political Attitudes among African Americans, Latinos, and Whites
AN  - 1315601554; 201309252
AB  - Although there is considerable evidence that religion influences political opinions, it is unclear how this story plays out across different segments of the U.S. population. Utilizing the 2000 Religion and Politics Survey, we examine the effects of religious beliefs, behaviors, and affiliations on citizens' attitudes relating to issues of egalitarianism. Our study is one of the few to comparatively analyze the link between religious measures and political outlooks for the nation's three largest ethno-racial groups. The findings show that conservative Christianity is consistently associated with less tolerant and less egalitarian views among whites. Religious African Americans and Latinos, however, hold more equitable opinions about disadvantaged individuals. To further strengthen our arguments, we also replicate these results using the 2008 American National Election Study. Overall, we demonstrate that a single perspective on religion and public opinion does not apply to all groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Manipulating national identity: the strategic use of rhetoric by supporters and opponents of the 'Cronulla riots' in Australia
AN  - 1567049409; 201435075
AB  - This research explores the role of opinion-based groups in understanding responses to racist violence such as the 2005 Cronulla riots in Australia. Traditionally, explanations of collective action in social psychology and sociology focus on conflict between broad social categories. We propose that the responses to the riots can be understood not only as inter-group conflict between Muslims and non-Muslims, or an in-group argument amongst non-Muslims, but as a bona fide inter-group conflict between supporters and opponents of the riots. We argue that these groups use rhetoric in attempts to claim dominant status within society by aligning their identities with positively valued social categories such as ethnicities and national identities. The analysis of rhetoric from the groups supporting and opposing the riots demonstrates consistent, albeit contested, attempts to align support for the riot with the Australian national category in conflict with countervailing attempts to align opposition to the riot with the same national category.

T1  - The Attitudes Toward Transgendered Individuals Scale: Psychometric Properties
AN  - 1322723470; 201310869
AB  - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered individuals are sexual and gender minorities subject to stigma in a heteronormative culture with binary gender role norms. Although much research has examined sexual stigma in the form of homophobia, or negative attitudes and reactions to homosexuals and homosexuality, little is known about the stigma experienced by transgendered individuals. Transgendered people are those whose gender identity (sense of oneself as a man or a woman) or gender expression (expression of oneself as a man or a woman in behavior, manner, and/or dress) differ from conventional expectations for their physical sex. Although a scale exists to measure transphobia or negative attitudes and reactions to transgendered individuals, it includes items tapping into overt behavioral expression of this stigma, or gender-bashing, and fails to identify or define transgendered persons as the attitudinal target of the items. A new scale was developed and evaluated in an effort to assess transgender-related stigma, separately from discrimination and violence, among members of the general population. Using two separate samples of college students ranging in age from 18-64 years, exploratory (N = 134) and confirmatory factor analyses (N = 237) were performed. The resulting 20-item, self-report measure demonstrated a single-factor structure, high internal consistency reliability, and evidence of convergent and discriminant construct validity.

T1  - Is an outgroup member in need a friend indeed? Personal and task-oriented contact as predictors of intergroup prosocial behavior
AN  - 1315600210; 201307390
AB  - Intergroup contact, particularly close personal contact, has been shown to improve intergroup relations, mainly by reducing negative attitudes and emotions toward outgroups. We argue that contact can also increase intergroup prosocial behavior. More specifically, we predict that different forms of contact will differentially impact on prosocial behavior directed at individual outgroup members and outgroups as a whole. Data of two studies (N1 = 264, N2 = 185), conducted with workgroups in two organizations, show that personal contact is a better predictor of prosocial behavior directed at individual outgroup members, whereas task-oriented contact is a better predictor of prosocial behavior directed at an outgroup as a whole. Additionally, Study 2 provides evidence that empathy mediates the path from personal contact to individual-directed prosocial behavior, whereas reward (but not cost) considerations mediate the path from task-oriented contact to outgroup-directed prosocial behavior. Implications for research on intergroup contact and prosocial behavior are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - From Enlightened Self-interest to Welfare Coalitions: Overcoming Identity-based Tensions in the Israeli Welfare State
AN  - 1221408751; 201246432
AB  - A common argument in the social policy literature is that ethnic and identity-based heterogeneity undermines the welfare state. In part, this happens because of difficulties in the generation of broad social solidarity in diverse societies: solidarity which is allegedly necessary for sustaining public support for the welfare state. This study explores this argument's logic in the context of welfare state politics in Israel. Israel would appear to be a near-perfect example of how heterogeneity strains social solidarity and, in turn, undermines the welfare state. Quite differently from most studies, however, this work's emphasis is not on public attitudes or voting, but on the political interaction between economically disadvantaged identity-based minorities -- specifically Arabs on the one hand and religious Jews on the other -- in the welfare field. It is argued that shared interests enable extensive co-operation among political elites in the welfare field despite religiously- and nationally-based antagonism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From Tolerance to Respect in Inter-Ethnic Contexts
AN  - 1347783679; 201318898
AB  - When advocates of multiculturalism promote democratic values, they often call for tolerance and respect. The pairwise usage of these concepts wrongly presumes a similar, if not the same, positively connoted meaning. This article depicts an important difference between respect and tolerance, not only in terms of semantics but also regarding the concepts' impact on social interactions. Being tolerated often means to be 'put up with' or to be grudgingly ignored. Multicultural approaches that are based on tolerance, then, may send misleading signals, as they implicitly state that members of ethnic and racial minorities are actually not welcome. We argue that respect conveys a more suitable message for successful multicultural policy programmes. Drawing on a sociological theory of respect that connects respect with the agency of the target person, we show that respect means treating people as autonomous agents whose will and interests are taken seriously and who are not looked down on.

T1  - Agents of Change: Mixed-Race Households and the Dynamics of Neighborhood Segregation in the United States
AN  - 1364699796; 201323384
AB  - This article explores the effects of mixed-race household formation on trends in neighborhood-scale racial segregation. Census data show that these effects are nontrivial in relation to the magnitude of decadal changes in residential segregation. An agent-based model illustrates the potential long-run impacts of rising numbers of mixed-race households on measures of neighborhood-scale segregation. It reveals that high rates of mixed-race household formation will reduce residential segregation considerably. This occurs even when preferences for own-group neighbors are high enough to maintain racial separation in residential space in a Schelling-type model. We uncover a disturbing trend, however; levels of neighborhood-scale segregation of single-race households can remain persistently high even while a growing number of mixed-race households drives down the overall rate of residential segregation. Thus, the article's main conclusion is that parsing neighborhood segregation levels by household type-single versus mixed race-is essential to interpret correctly trends in the spatial separation of racial groups, especially when the fraction of households that are mixed race is dynamic. More broadly, the article illustrates the importance of household-scale processes for urban outcomes and joins debates in geography about interscalar relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Citizenship, Co-ethnic Populations, and Employment Probabilities of Immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1125224053; 201240353
AB  - Over the last decades, Sweden has liberalized its citizenship policy by reducing the required number of years of residency to 5 years for foreign citizens and only 2 years for Nordic citizens. Dual citizenship has been allowed since 2001. During the same period, immigration patterns by country of birth changed substantially, with an increasing number of immigrants arriving from non-western countries. Furthermore, immigrants were settling in larger cities as opposed to smaller towns as was the case before. Interestingly, the employment integration of immigrants has declined gradually, and in 2006, the employment rate for foreign-born individuals is substantially lower compared with the native-born. The aim of this paper is to explore the link between citizenship and employment probabilities for immigrants in Sweden, controlling for a range of demographic, human capital, and municipal characteristics such as city and co-ethnic population size. The information we employ for this analysis consists of register data on the whole population of Sweden held by Statistics Sweden for the year 2006. The basic register, STATIV, includes demographic, socio-economic, and immigrant specific information. In this paper, we used instrumental variable regression to examine the "clean" impact of citizenship acquisition and the size of the co-immigrant population on the probability of being employed. In contrast to Scott (2008), we find that citizenship acquisition has a positive impact for a number of immigrant groups. This is particularly the case for non-EU/non-North American immigrants. In terms of intake class, refugees appear to experience substantial gains from citizenship acquisition (this is not, however, the case for immigrants entering as family class). We find that the impact of the co-immigrant population is particularly important for immigrants from Asia and Africa. These are also the countries that have the lowest employment rate.

T1  - Self-perceived Integration of Immigrants and their Children
AN  - 1417527228; 201332105
AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between immigrant generation and subjective well-being. The study disaggregates the immigrant population into first, 1.5, second, and higher order "generations" and compares their prospects for social integration. The study focuses on two aspects of integration: sense of belonging to Canada and feelings of discomfort living in the host society. The analysis also addresses whether the effects of immigrant generation on integration are conditional on the context of settlement, including racial status and neighbourhood environment. The study merges data from the 2001 Canadian Census and the postcensus Ethnic Diversity Survey. The primary conclusion is that the relationship between immigrant generation and integration is complex. The findings demonstrate the need to use a fine-grained approach for understanding the integration of immigrants and their children. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RESEARCHING RACE IN CHILE
AN  - 1283641457; 201303248
AB  - Job-market discrimination research in the United States and Europe measures discrimination by a majority against racial minorities, discrimination that stems from historical patterns of inequality and privilege. Chilean researchers have applied these models to study class-based discrimination, finding some evidence to support its existence. Their innovative methods make race as well as class visible, and contradictions in their work show racial differences among Chileans. This research note highlights the interesting research from a new generation of labor economists who have simultaneously pushed the sanctioned limits of social debate and reaffirmed dominant explanations of inequality. Critical race theory is useful for making sense of the contradictions in their work and, it is argued, can improve the quality of Chilean social science research so as to reach a more accurate and self-reflective understanding of the sources and effects of inequality in Chile.

T1  - Political Nationalism and Attitudes towards Immigration: The Interaction of Knowledge and Policy
AN  - 1125223874; 201240499
AB  - The issue of immigration is highly salient to citizens of industrialised democracies. Globalisation and the emergence of an international human rights regime, among other reasons, led to high levels of immigration to industrialised countries in recent decades. Immigrant-receiving states have shown only limited ability to control the size and composition of their immigrant population. Immigration has therefore emerged as a prominent political issue in practically all economically developed countries, and there are raising concerns over anti-immigration sentiments and nationalist tendencies that seem to be taking hold among modern publics. We argue that anti-immigration attitudes are not merely a response to increased immigration, but rather that these attitudes mirror governments' nationalistic and anti-immigration stance. In addition, people who are interested in politics are expected to be more influenced by their governments' policies than those who show less interest. We use data from the European Social Survey and the Comparative Manifesto Project to test these claims. Results from our multilevel models show that people living in countries where the government is right wing are more opposed to immigration than people living in countries where the government exhibits less right-wing tendencies. The effect of government policy positions is also found to be conditioned by political interest at the individual level. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Explaining racial disparities in access to employment benefits
AN  - 1037879176; 201231204
AB  - This research examines disparities in access to pension and health insurance plans between white, blacks, Latino and Asian workers in the American labour force. Using data from the 2006 March Supplement of the Current Population Survey, the analysis reveals that Latino workers are the most disadvantaged and white workers are the most advantaged. The entire gap in likelihood of receiving benefits between whites and Asians, and a substantial portion of the gap between whites and blacks, can be accounted for by socio-demographic and employment-related variables, but only a small portion of the gap between whites and Latinos can be attributed to such variables. The findings suggest that reliance on earnings for estimation of inequality underestimates the economic gap between racial groups. Explanations for disparities in access to employment benefits are offered and the relevance of the findings to other societies is discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Encoding and Fake Equality in Popular Reality Shows: Lessons from Israel
AN  - 1023030516; 201223876
AB  - This paper critically examines the representation of two major minorities in Israel, Arab citizens of Israel and Jewish immigrants, by focusing on the widely popular genre of reality shows. We demonstrate that this genre contains sophisticated mechanisms of differentiation and selection that inevitably exclude and stigmatise minority participants. To demonstrate this thesis the paper takes a close look at two Israeli reality shows that were conceived to have a public value-Wanted: A Leader and The Ambassador. The examination of these shows reveals how Israeliness-presented as the space of equal opportunity-contains discriminatory mechanisms based on national and ethnic affiliations. Thus, the study illustrates that national identity could be utilised as a meta-narrative of universality and inclusiveness, but actually refers to a particular type of identity that is ethnically restricted.

T1  - Weak Performance-Strong Determination: School Achievement and Educational Choice among Children of Immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 919904471; 201201662
AB  - We ask how the advantages and disadvantages in the educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden are produced, making a theoretical distinction between mechanisms connected with school performance on one hand, and educational choice on the other. Using a new data set, covering six full cohorts of Swedish-born ninth-graders in 1998-2003 (N = 612,730), with matched school-Census information, we show that children of non-European immigrant origin are disadvantaged in their school performance but advantaged in their choice of academic upper secondary education. They have lower and more often incomplete grades, which force a sizeable proportion-10-20 per cent-into non-meritorious tracks or lead them to leave school. Given grades, children of non-European background make heterogeneous choices: many do not enrol in upper secondary education, but among those who do the propensity is high that they choose academic studies before vocational. In contrast, children of the 'old' (chiefly Nordic) labour immigrants are similar to the majority group in their equal preference for these two routes. A school system where choice plays a significant role appears to be advantageous for the often high-aspiring second-generation immigrant students, but greater efforts to reduce early achievement differences may still alleviate ethnic minority disadvantages.

T1  - HIV Risk Profiles Among HIV-Positive, Methamphetamine-Using Men Who Have Sex with Both Men and Women
AN  - 902084046; 201123588
AB  - This study examined demographic characteristics, sexual risk behaviors, sexual beliefs, and substance use patterns in HIV-positive, methamphetamine-using men who have sex with both men and women (MSMW) (n=50) as compared to men who have sex with men only (MSM) (n=150). Separate logistic regressions were conducted to predict group membership. In the final model, of 12 variables, eight were independently associated with group membership. Factors independently associated with MSMW were acquiring HIV through injection drug use, being an injection drug user, using hallucinogens, using crack, being less likely to have sex at a bathhouse, being less likely to be the receptive partner when high on methamphetamine, having greater intentions to use condoms for oral sex, and having more negative attitudes about HIV disclosure. These results suggest that, among HIV-positive methamphetamine users, MSMW differ significantly from MSM in terms of their HIV risk behaviors. Studies of gay men and HIV often also include bisexual men, grouping them all together as MSM, which may obscure important differences between MSMW and MSM. It is important that future studies consider MSM and MSMW separately in order to expand our knowledge about differential HIV prevention needs for both groups. This study showed that there were important differences in primary and secondary prevention needs of MSM and MSMW. These findings have implications for both primary and secondary HIV prevention among these high-risk populations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Color by Numbers: Minority Earnings in Canada 1995-2005
AN  - 914766575; 201200191
AB  - We investigate the pattern of earnings disparity across Canadian-born ethnic groups in Canada over three census years, 1996, 2001, and 2006. This extends "Colour My World" by 10 years (Pendakur and Pendakur 2002). We find that the earnings gaps faced by Canadian-born visible minorities have not eroded since the 1990s. This is somewhat surprising given that the size of this population has radically increased over the last 20 years. Other patterns observed in the 1990s, such as the relatively poor earnings outcomes of South Asians and Blacks, particularly in Montreal and Toronto, are still evident into the 2000s. An exception to the "bad news" outlook is that persons of Caribbean origin have seen substantial convergence in their earnings relative to majority workers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Rights as a Normative Framework for Addressing the Situation of Roma in Europe
AN  - 907927881; 201124706
AB  - Roma are the largest and most marginalized ethnic group in Europe, suffering from severe poverty, racial hostility, the obliteration of their culture and exclusion from public life. This study argues that the various types of injustice faced by the Roma in terms of agency and socio-economic conditions are interdependent and need to be tackled in a single normative framework. The aim of the paper is to examine how well the international system of minority rights protection is suited to dealing with these multifaceted disadvantages. It sets aside the question of whether governments are honouring their commitments under minority rights law. Instead it investigates whether and how minority rights law meets the recognition and redistribution issues faced by Roma, so that it might be used as a normative paradigm for policy-makers facing different approaches to the Roma question. To this end, it examines the substantive content of minority rights and concludes that they address Roma recognition issues via provisions related to: minority physical existence; cultural existence and identity; and participation in public affairs. Unlike other normative paradigms, such as socio-economic rights, minority rights law lacks redistribution provisions per se. Yet, it deals with Roma welfare issues through a rich concept of substantial equality. Minority rights law captures the group dimension of Roma disadvantage and puts forward positive duties so that societal structures generating social exclusion and discrimination are transformed.

T1  - Contemporary indigeneity and the contours of its modernity
AN  - 964189734; 201207501
AB  - This article examines the idioms of 'modernity' with specific focus on indigenous peoples and their engagement with larger society in respect of culture, development and jurisprudence. This engagement in the past 50 years has largely been within the terms of the nation-state system, and related international fora. It is argued that these indigenous communities, in all their great diversity across the world, have nevertheless been largely successful in carving out adequate political spaces to stake their claims as distinct 'peoples' rather than simply being recognized as one among the several ethnic groups or minorities of a nation-state polity. This distinction is crucial and this paper shows why and how. This is not to say that the indigenous communities the world over have similar terms of engagement as their own heterogeneity defies any neat typological schema. At the same time, the multiple idioms of the current indigenous discourse, however, should not be treated as cacophonic but as embodying consciously crafted tools for boundary negotiations and voicing indigenous identities. This article reflects on this achievement by providing a survey of these developments even as it critically explores the terms of the discourses themselves.

T1  - National Identity in the Political Discourse in Slovakia
AN  - 905650545
AB  - The present paper seeks to integrate social identity theory and theory of social representations, in the attempt to describe the links between the national identity and Slovakia's attitudes towards the Other. The paper's position is founded in the assumption that national identity is constructed and deconstructed discursively through the means of socialisation (media, education, legislation and everyday practices). Slovakia has recently adopted several controversial acts that substantially regulate the aforementioned means of socialisation, and are said to be designed to protect the nation, national identity and integrity, which itself implies perception of a threat of some kind. It is hypothesized that rhetoric of such laws constructs national identity as one that is threatened by the Other, while overemphasizing the presence of intergroup threat and conflict. Such discourse thus makes people defend themselves and re-evaluate their national identity, by reaffirming who they are in the respective intergroup affairs. The conflicts not only heighten identification with a group but also create antagonistic intergroup attitudes. Through a brief discourse analysis of the abovementioned laws (Act on the State Language, Act on Citizenship and Patriotism Act) the paper aims to analyse social representations of nation and national identity in the political discourse and their potential impact on intergroup relations between the so called 'Old Slovaks' (ethnic Slovaks) and the Other. We thus seek to test the extent to which Slovakia adheres to the universalistic principles of equality and justice, or to which it heightens social significance of ethnicity and creates division within society.

T1  - The impact of light skin on prison time for black female offenders
AN  - 1221408217; 201244180
AB  - There is a long history of social science research on the importance of race for determining life outcomes. However, there are relatively few social science studies on the importance of skin tone within racial groups. Some recent research has documented the quantifiable advantages associated with having a lighter skin shade, particularly in terms of occupational attainment and earnings among blacks. A handful of studies focusing on black men have also suggested that when authorities perceive offenders as having a lighter skin shade it translates into more lenient criminal justice outcomes. The present analysis extends this line of inquiry by examining how perceived skin tone (assessed by correctional officers) is related to maximum prison sentence and actual time served for over 12,000 black women imprisoned in North Carolina between 1995 and 2009. Controlling for several factors, the results indicated that black women deemed to have a lighter skin tone received more lenient prison sentences and served less time behind bars.

T1  - Immigration and the Legacies of the Past: The Impact of Slavery and the Holocaust on Contemporary Immigrants in the United States and Western Europe
AN  - 756015689
AB  - It is a basic truism that the past influences the present, but the key questions concern which past and how its impact occurs. In this paper we seek to understand how legacies of the past affect the pathways and experiences of contemporary immigrants. Our specific concern is with the present-day impact of two momentous historical ethno-racial traumas: the Holocaust in Western Europe, and slavery and ensuing legal segregation ("Jim Crow") in the United States. At first blush, their legacies seem unrelated to immigration today, and these pasts are rarely central to discussions about it. But in fact memories of and institutional responses to the sins of the Nazi genocide, on the one hand, and of slavery and legal racial segregation, on the other, have played a role in shaping public perceptions and policies that affect contemporary immigrants and their children.

T1  - Being "In" With the In-Crowd: The Effects of Social Exclusion and Inclusion Are Enhanced by the Perceived Essentialism of Ingroups and Outgroups
AN  - 1928322917
AB  - Social belonging is an essential human need. Belonging to social groups serves an important role in shaping our social identities. Nonetheless, research indicates that exclusion by ingroup and outgroup members seems equally aversive. The current studies test the hypothesis that unlike more trivial groups (e.g., smoking or computer preferences), highly essentialized groups may lead to differential effects of ingroup versus outgroup rejection. Consistent with this, exclusion and inclusion by racial ingroup members (relative to racial outgroup members) exacerbated the sting of rejection and the glow of inclusion (Study 1). In a second study, direct manipulations of essentialist beliefs about ingroups and outgroups (i.e., political affiliations) led to the same results. These results offer a novel demonstration that essentialized ingroup--outgroup distinctions enhance the sting of social exclusion and the positivity of social inclusion.
