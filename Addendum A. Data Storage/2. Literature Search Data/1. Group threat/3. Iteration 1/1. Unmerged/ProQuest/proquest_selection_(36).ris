T1  - Passive Revolution in Japan: The Restoration of Hegemony under Abe?
AN  - 2617949845
AB  - This article draws on Gramsci’s theory of passive revolution to explore the second tenure of Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzō from 2012 to 2020. It sees the high degree of political stability that Abe achieved as a contrast to the preceding two decades of Japanese politics and asks what accounts for Abe’s success in restoring Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP) dominance in an era of enduring economic and social crisis. The article argues that Abe executed a strategy of passive revolution that incorporated two “faces”: an “outward” face oriented around consent and an “inward” face rooted in coercion. The former involved economic policies (in particular “Abenomics”) designed to appear capable of resolving chronic economic stagnation, growing inequality and other social and economic problems, restoring popular support for the LDP without undermining conditions for capital accumulation or empowering subaltern classes. In contrast, the latter involved various low-profile security and administrative policies that enabled the Abe government to dramatically increase its power while silencing or disarming potential rivals and critics. The article sees this two-sided strategy of passive revolution as effective in restoring LDP dominance but unlikely to prove the basis for a more expansive hegemony or a resolution to Japan’s organic crisis.

T1  - The role of value perceptions in intergroup conflict and cooperation
AN  - 2567817835
AB  - Democratic politics, at its core, consists of competition between group interests. What brings groups into social and political conflict with each other, and what may instead drive them to cooperate or become allies? This paper presents evidence from a nationally representative non-probability survey, finding that groups’ perceived values—that is, their general beliefs about what is right or desirable—relate to a broad array of intergroup relationships. Individuals who perceive racial, religious, and partisan outgroup members as supporting self-transcendence values (those related to care, cooperation and other prosocial behaviors) express more positive affect, solidarity, willingness to engage in political action, and tolerance with respect to those groups. The magnitude of this association exceeds those of other perceived basic and political values, even when it comes to explicitly political attitudes or target groups. Thus, fundamental, ostensibly nonpolitical beliefs about outgroups’ prosocial intentions may underlie intergroup conflict and cooperation.

T1  - A National Conversation About Race? Political Discussion Across Lines of Racial and Partisan Difference
AN  - 2492207424
AB  - Dialogue about race-based topics is essential to combat prejudice, foster mutual understanding, and improve race relations. This study describes the extent to which political conversations—especially those about race-related topics—are taking place within and across racial and political groups. This national survey with a Black oversample found racially diverse discussion networks to be more likely among Blacks than Whites, but politically diverse networks to be more likely among Whites than Blacks. Blacks were more likely than Whites to talk about race-related topics such as police treatment of Blacks (and less likely about several topics not explicitly tied to race), but by no means did Whites entirely avoid race-related topics, even in their same-race discussions. Moreover, there was evidence that discussion in cross-race dyads affected the mix of topics Whites and Blacks discussed, revealing the potential for cross-race interaction to alter political agendas. Rather than being less likely to talk about police treatment of Blacks with Blacks, Whites were more likely to discuss this topic when in mixed-race dyads, while Blacks talked about it less often with Whites than with other Blacks. Findings are discussed in the context of political disagreement and intergroup contact theory.

T1  - What it means to be a “true American”: Ethnonationalism and voting in the 2016 U.S. presidential election
AN  - 2509234204
AB  - A number of important factors predicted white people vote choice in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including voters' economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, and status threat. In this paper, I establish that ethnonationalism—a set of beliefs concerning what it means to be a “true” American—was also a significant factor in the estimations of White Americans when casting their vote for president in 2016. Data from a nationally representative sample of White Americans show that ethnonationalism was a robust predictor of vote choice for Trump even after controlling for predictors known to shape vote choice, including economic assessments, sexist attitudes, racial resentment, status threat, and sociodemographic indicators. These results indicate that ethnonationalism, although correlated with some of these factors, operated primarily as an independent factor that shaped White vote choice. The findings have important implications concerning the electoral activation of White majorities concerned about the perceived threat that demographic change poses to American national identity.

T1  - Intercultural priorities among immigrant organizations in Galicia (Spain): Beyond the offensive and defensive binary
AN  - 2499391778
AB  - In this article we analyze the situation of immigrant organizations during the European economic crisis. We set out to examine how, during a period of heightened economic insecurity, priorities among these multiples roles might shift when members find themselves in a particularly vulnerable situation. Data was collected in the form of 16 extended semi-structured interviews with group representatives throughout the Galician autonomous community in north-western Spain. Our data provide an empirically-based study that have led us to adapt Schrover and Vermeulen's (2005) classification of immigrant association approaches as either defensive (responding to social exclusion) or offensive (emphasizing differences with respect to the destination society), extending this scheme to include a third approach, which our data show to be a priority even under conditions of economic insecurity: claims for intercultural relations with receiving society members with the goal of increased social cohesion and mutual understanding.

T1  - Meeting a nice asylum seeker: Intergroup contact changes stereotype content perceptions and associated emotional prejudices, and encourages solidarity‐based collective action intentions
AN  - 2265592849
AB  - Intergroup contact can improve majority members’ perception of minorities. Integrating the intergroup contact hypothesis with the stereotype content model and BIAS‐Map, we hypothesized that positive intergroup contact improves German majority members’ evaluations of asylum seekers on the warmth and competence dimensions. Using cross‐sectional survey data and structural equation modelling, we found support for this hypothesis (Study 1a, N = 182). Warmth and competence perceptions, in turn, predicted specific intergroup emotions (Study 1b, N = 255). A causal effect of intergroup contact on changes in stereotype content, emotions, and solidarity‐based collective action intentions as an important facilitative behavioural intention debated in the intergroup contact literature is established with experimental data (Study 2, N = 74). Participants interacting with an asylum seeker rated asylum seekers higher on warmth and specific intergroup emotions and were more supportive of solidarity‐based collective actions in favour of asylum seekers. Our study demonstrates that contact has differential effects on cognitive, affective, and behavioural components of prejudice towards asylum seekers that are systematically linked.

T1  - Exposure to Neoliberalism Increases Resentment of the Elite via Feelings of Anomie and Negative Psychological Reactions
AN  - 2190816412
AB  - For several decades now, neoliberalism has been the dominant economic and political ideology throughout large parts of the world. In many places, its rise has gone hand in hand with growing social inequality and a cultural emphasis on individualism and competition. Lately, concerns are being raised about the effects of these developments on politics and societies. The renewed rise of populism in Europe, the United States, and other countries has been attributed to economic insecurity among the working and middle classes by politicians, journalists, and academics alike. Similarly, the spread of nationalist and anti‐immigration sentiments is frequently interpreted as a result of fears over job security and perceived competition in a hostile economic climate. We examined the effect of neoliberalism on two types of prejudice (anti‐elitism and anti‐immigrant prejudice) across two studies in Germany (N = 198) and the UK (N = 173). Results show that priming neoliberalism leads to higher levels of anti‐elitism but not anti‐immigrant prejudice and that this effect is mediated by anomie and negative psychological reactions (feelings of threat, unfairness, and hopelessness). Thus, our research suggests that while neoliberalism is linked to lower social cohesion and increased outgroup derogation, this is not primarily directed against disadvantaged social groups but against those at the top.

T1  - Sexual Orientation Differences in Whites’ Racial Attitudes﻿
AN  - 2009112533
AB  - Historical and anecdotal accounts present a contradictory image of predominantly white lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer (LGBTQ) communities in the United States: a unique celebration of racial and other forms of diversity, yet pervasive racial discrimination and exclusion that mirrors racism of the broader society. However, no study to date has compared the racial attitudes of white heterosexual and white LGB Americans. Using nationally representative data from the American National Election Survey 2012 Times Series Study, I investigate the effect of sexual orientation on whites’ racial attitudes in the domains of symbolic, color‐blind, and old‐fashioned racism. Compared to white heterosexuals, white LGB people hold more favorable attitudes toward black people, most notably in the domain of symbolic racism. On average, over 40% of sexual orientation gaps in whites’ racial attitudes is explained by white LGB respondents’ more liberal political ideology; their greater awareness of homophobic discrimination explains, on average, one‐fifth of these sexual orientation gaps. These findings suggest that white LGB racial attitudes must be examined at the intersection of their privileged racial and disadvantaged sexual identities.

T1  - The importance of social-cognitive development and the developmental context for group dynamics: GPIR
AN  - 1932700126
AB  - A developmental approach provides a unique vantage point for understanding the origins, acquisition, and nature of change regarding intergroup attitudes and behavior. Developmental research has focused predominantly on understanding and addressing negative intergroup attitudes and behaviors. We assert that group identity and group dynamics do not have to lead to discriminatory and prejudicial behavior but can actually contribute to an inclusive orientation. Moreover, these orientations do not occur in a vacuum but depend on the broader social context and the specific group distinctions. A broader social and cultural approach is important for understanding the implications of intergroup attitudes for healthy social development as well as the creation of a fair and just society.

T1  - Intra-EU Migration: Legal and Economic View on Jobseekers' Welfare Rights
AN  - 1924202084
AB  - International migration influences economies of both the home and the host country. Some countries perceive immigration as a threat and consider limitations to their social security system to protect the domestic economy. Within the European Union, both the economic and the legal side of the issue must be taken into account. The paper presents an empirical analysis of natives' and immigrants' unemployment rates in EU15 countries and discusses a possible use of the findings in intra-EU migration policy. Using Labour Force Survey Data for 2012, we estimate a series of logistic regressions in order to compare the immigrant/native unemployment rates, considering the differences in the structure of both subpopulations (in terms of age, sex, education and types of jobs). We conclude that a substantial part of the gap between natives' and immigrants' unemployment rates can be explained by these additional characteristics in most of the EU15 countries.

T1  - Cultural repertoires, discursive alliances, and the phenomenology of ethnoracial exclusions
AN  - 1900934609
AB  - The book Getting Respect is crucial to the in-depth comprehension of the relations between cultural repertoires and the phenomenology of everyday life, the cultural processes affiliated with becoming a subject, and the cultural dynamics that create and maintain inequality. Following a description of the principal findings in the book, a discussion will be offered about four important issues that the book encourages us to continue to research, and which are critical to the contemporary studies of race and ethnicity.

T1  - Under the shadow of genocide: Rwandans, ethnicity and refugee status
AN  - 1871585291
AB  - This article discusses ethnicity and refugee status among Rwandan refugees self-settled in Nairobi, Kenya. It addresses conflation of Hutu fugitives who participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and refugees, and critiques perception of Hutu and Tutsi as mutually exclusive ethnicities with no points of intersection. Framed within the social constructivist approach to identity, the article problematizes ethnic essentialism and wholesale criminalization and stigmatization of Rwandan refugees and, in particular, Hutu ethnicity in ways that silence individual viewpoints emanating from personal experience. Conversely, the article highlights how Rwandan refugees deflect collective guilt and legitimize their refugee status under the shadow of the genocide which was committed by extremist Hutu on Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The refugees' reaction to association with the genocide confounds theoretically irreconcilable extremes through self-representations centred on experiences that muddle the simplistic perpetrator - victim and guilty - innocent binary. The refugees' narratives portray victimhood in Rwanda as complex, cyclical and heterogeneous.

T1  - Why High School Students Aspire to Emigrate: Evidence from Greece
AN  - 1865256937
AB  - This paper investigates why Greek high school students aspire to emigrate, in relation to their educational and socio-economic background. Through fieldwork research conducted at three specialist high schools in Thessaloniki, three main conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, potential emigrants are ambitious, with high educational and professional expectations and a clear migration plan. Secondly, they are middle and upper middle class and excel at school--in socio-economic and educational terms, they therefore constitute the most dynamic Greek youths. Thirdly, in a period of recession on a European level, the alarming fact is that student emigration can undermine recovery for a country in crisis such as Greece. That is, middle-class shrinkage caused by the recession can be aggravated by emigration, which in turn might cost the loss of developmental human resources for Greece and a deepening of the recession. This can further stimulate migration, resulting in a vicious circle between crisis and emigration. Furthermore, if potential emigrants do not return because temporary emigration for studies becomes permanent migration for work, the economic crisis is worsened, and Greece's prospects for development are further undermined.

T1  - Identifying With a Stereotype: The Divergent Effects of Exposure to Homosexual Television Characters
AN  - 1904238337
AB  - Scholars examining homosexual television characters have typically come to one of two conclusions: either exposure to homosexual characters can lead to increased acceptance, or homosexual characters serve to reaffirm negative stereotypes. We seek to bridge these two bodies of research by introducing the concept of stereotyped identification-the idea that cognitively and emotionally identifying with fictional characters can increase acceptance of minorities, while reinforcing implicit stereotypes about how they look, act, and talk. Results from our national survey (N = 972) offer support for this hypothesis.

T1  - From Affirmed Privilege to Experiences of Discrimination: Majority Anglophones' Perceptions of Linguistic Majority-Minority Dynamics in Canada
AN  - 1897665884
AB  - This paper explores the rarely addressed subject of linguistic majority in the context of Canadian society, through a qualitative analysis of 20 semi-directed interviews with majority Anglophone participants. It was found that while participants acknowledged a certain form of privilege related to their majority status within Canadian society, it was also common for them to experience situations in which they felt overlooked, marginalized and even discriminated against. "Linguistic privilege" has not been the subject of more studies because it is often seen as a "default", taken-for-granted status in Canadian society. However, studying this form of privilege and its intersections with other dimensions of identity such as gender, class and race could lead to new insights on language, power and group identity. Moreover, studies on "the majority" are especially pertinent in a context where "silent majorities" are becoming increasingly vocal in stating their dissatisfaction and feelings of discrimination. This article can provide pathways to a better understanding of this emergent issue. Alternate abstract:Le « privilège linguistique » est un concept peu exploité dans la littérature scientifique, puisqu'être anglophone en situation majoritaire constitue le statu quo de l'identité canadienne. Pourtant, l'étude de cette forme possible de privilège et de ses intersections avec d'autres catégories sociales telles que la classe, le genre et la race s'avère un terreau très fertile pour l'analyse des liens entre la langue, le pouvoir et l'identité de groupe. Cet article s'intéresse au sujet peu documenté de la majorité linguistique au Canada à l'aide d'une analyse qualitative de 20 entretiens semi-dirigés réalisés auprès d'individus anglophones en situation majoritaire. Nos résultats montrent que bien que les participants reconnaissaient leur statut privilégié au sein de la société canadienne, ces derniers pouvaient également vivre des situations dans lesquelles ils se sentaient invisibles et marginalisés, voire discriminés. De plus, les études « sur la majorité » sont particulièrement pertinentes dans le contexte sociopolitique actuel où les « majorités silencieuses » prennent parole pour dénoncer leur insatisfaction et leurs sentiments d'injustice.

T1  - Heterosexism, Depression, and Campus Engagement Among LGBTQ College Students: Intersectional Differences and Opportunities for Healing
AN  - 1892727792
AB  - LGBTQ people experience health disparities related to multilevel processes of sexual and gender marginalization, and intersections with racism can compound these challenges for LGBTQ people of color. Although community engagement may be protective for mental health broadly and for LGBTQ communities in buffering against heterosexism, little research has been conducted on the racialized dynamics of these processes among LGBTQ communities. This study analyzes cross-sectional survey data collected among a diverse sample of LGBTQ college students (n = 460), which was split by racial status. Linear regression models were used to test main effects of interpersonal heterosexism and engagement with campus organizations on depression, as well as moderating effects of campus engagement. For White LGBTQ students, engaging in student leadership appears to weaken the heterosexism-depression link-specifically, the experience of interpersonal microaggressions. For LGBTQ students of color, engaging in LGBTQ-specific spaces can strengthen the association between sexual orientation victimization and depression.

T1  - The Racial Turn in Ethnic History
AN  - 1864054713
AB  - Roediger argues for the positions that since the 1990s, ethnic history has taken a racial turn, that this has benefited immigration history, and that the Journal of American Ethnic History (JAEH) ought to applaud itself for helping to foster this development. Any such a turn certainly had plural dimensions. Historians have studied how whiteness has mattered in structuring experiences and consciousness among immigrants from Europe, and at times, all immigrants. More importantly, the study of immigrants racialized as not white has flowered. The editor's use of George Sanchez's important 1999 JAEH article, "Race, Nation, and Culture in Recent Immigration Studies," seems an apt point of departure for viewing both of these racial turns--toward studying the movement of some immigrants toward whiteness, and toward studying "non-white" immigrants--especially when combined with the companion pieces in the "Assessing the Field" section of the same 1999 issue of JAEH.

T1  - Skilled Immigrants and the Negotiation of Family Relations During Settlement in Calgary, Alberta
AN  - 1830616514
AB  - When re-establishing their lives in Canada, international migrants with dependent children regularly encounter dramatically different conditions for family life. The parents' employment situation, the limited availability of extended kin to help with child rearing, and a multicultural and relatively more permissive social environment, all of these invite or even demand changes in newcomers' family practices. Yet, more information is needed about the ways in which skilled immigrants negotiate the changed conditions for work and family life in this country, and the impact this has on family dynamics during settlement. Drawing on data from interviews with 30 skilled immigrants living in Calgary, Alberta, this paper explores how coming to Canada impacted participants' situations of paid work, parenting practices, and familial gender relations. Findings suggest that strained economic and social resources often limited the extent to which mothers and fathers were able to maintain an organization of family life similar to what they had established in their country of origin. However, while in some cases, shifts in family formation caused heightened levels of stress and strain and further entrenched the doing of conventional gender roles, in others, changed conditions acted as a catalyst for positive change. The tools that eased the burdens of settlement for some are explored, and recommendations are made for how to better support newcomer families.

T1  - Immigration and Occupational Mobility of Native Workers in Spain. A Gender Perspective
AN  - 1830616485
AB  - This paper studies the economic effect of immigration on native working conditions, focusing on the impact of the inflow of immigrant labour on occupational mobility among native workers. Basing on a gender-segmented labour market, we propose an extension of the model presented by Peri and Sparber American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(3), 135-169, ( 2009 ). The model controls for gender and time in order to check for potential differences in immigration effects associated with gender or immigrant length of residence. This research reveals the existence of such differences, by showing that female immigrant inflow has a greater positive short-term impact on occupational mobility among female unskilled native workers. In addition, the long-term study discloses a slight occupational assimilation of male immigrants towards employment patterns of male native workers and a permanent confinement of female immigrants in a few "niche jobs".

T1  - Just like the USA? Critical notes on Alba and Foner's cross-Atlantic research agenda
AN  - 1818405378
AB  - A critical review of Alba and Foner's Strangers No More (2015) which focuses on questioning their comparative assimilation of European cases of immigrant integration to the North American, specifically U.S., experience. While this may work in terms of how national immigrant integration has mitigated over time racial discrimination for older, post-colonial migrants, it misrepresents the complex differentiations involved in the super-diversity of recent 'new' migrations within and to Europe. In particular, the variety of types and origins of recent migration is lost in their understanding of the U.K. case, with problems linked to their interpretation of data about minorities and foreigners in the country.

T1  - Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou's The Asian American Achievement Paradox
AN  - 1817595733
AB  - Why is an increasingly diverse American society simultaneously becoming more economically stratified? The dynamic and ever-shifting causes and consequences of rising income inequality demand that we move beyond facile and essentialist notions about who achieves and why. Race and ethnicity play critical roles in shaping opportunity structures and the distribution of resources, and immigration has long been understood in policy debates, scholarly inquiry, and American national narrative to be an important driver of the economic and social mobility of various racial and ethnic groups. Social science research is uniquely poised to explore these issues with textured nuance and analytical sophistication, offering much-needed interventions in a national conversation that can veer in directions that are hackneyed, inaccurate, and even irresponsible. We are therefore pleased to present this symposium on The Asian American Achievement Paradox, an important scholarly work with ‘real world’ utility that offers a fresh perspective on the dynamics of inequality by focusing on a group that has achieved a great deal of success over the last several decades: Asian Americans. Authored by sociologists Jennifer Lee and Min Zhou, the book leverages the fields of sociology, psychology, and Asian American Studies to weave together a detailed analysis at the structural, institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels. We have invited Patricia Fernández-Kelly, Amy Hsin, Tomás R. Jiménez, Philip Kasinitz, and Van C. Tran, five of today’s most prominent scholars of immigration, to offer commentary on how the book illuminates, challenges, and pushes the scholarship in important and useful new directions. They also offer thoughtful critiques as they engage with the core arguments of the book, and Lee and Zhou provide a Rejoinder to explore the questions raised and respond to the critiques.

T1  - Twice Migrants in Canada: Who Are They and How Do They Perform Economically?
AN  - 1811906159
AB  - Immigrants known as "twice migrants" are those who arrive in Canada via an intermediate country, that is, not directly from their country of birth. With a focus on large contemporary immigrant groups in Canada--South Asians, Chinese and Filipinos in particular--this study develops socio-economic profiles of twice migrants and assesses their economic performance in comparison to that of direct migrants. The study uses custom tables of multiple national level datasets as well as qualitative interviews with a selected group of twice-migrant families to arrive at its findings. The results show that relative to direct migrants, twice migrants were older, more likely to speak a Canadian official language, slightly more educated and more skilled. These human capital characteristics did not however fully translate into economic success. Political and economic situations both in the country of birth and the country of last place of residence affect the flow of twice migration. Lack of job opportunities in Canada forced many twice migrant families to split between two countries.

T1  - Does Employment-Related Migration Reduce Poverty in India?
AN  - 1811200426
AB  - Using the unit data from the 64th round of the National Sample Surveys, 2007-08 on employment, unemployment, and migration, covering 125,578 households, this paper estimates the level, depth, and severity of poverty among non-migrants and intra-state migrants, inter-state migrants, and emigrants in India. Based on the out-migration of any members of the household for employment at place of origin and using place of last residence definition, households are classified into intra-state migrants, inter-state migrant, emigrants, and non-migrant households. Economic well-being of migrant's households at the place of origin is measured by consumption expenditure (income). A set of poverty indices, the poverty headcount ratio, poverty gap ratio, and square poverty gap, are estimated from the household consumption expenditure to measure the level, depth, and severity of poverty among migration categories. The official state-specific poverty line is used in estimating the poverty indices. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression analyses are used in the analyses. Results suggest that the level, depth, and severity of poverty among migrant households is lower than that among non-migrant households; however, it varies across migrant categories. The poverty head count ratio was 41 % among inter-state migrants, 31 % among intra-state migrants, 20 % among emigrants, and 39 % among non-migrants in India. The poverty gap ratio and squared poverty gap were highest among inter-state migrants. Two broad patterns emerge from the state level analyses. Barring Kerala and Punjab that have a higher percentage of emigrants, inter-state migration accounts for a larger share of employment-related migration from the less developed states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha while intra-state migration accounts for a larger share in the developed states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu. Second, the level, depth, and severity of inter-state migrants from less developed states is higher than that of intra-state migrants and non-migrants; however, the pattern is reversed in the more developed states of India. Adjusting for socioeconomic correlates, the odds of poor among intra-state migrants are lower than those among inter-state migrant's households. The study supports the proposition that migration and remittances in India are not panacea to structural development constraints and that poor long-distance migrants need to be integrated in poverty alleviation programs.

T1  - Organisational legitimacy beyond ethnicity? Shifting organisational logics in the struggle for immigrant rights in Los Angeles
AN  - 1793307425
AB  - Immigrant political organisations in the United States have traditionally built political power by claiming to legitimately represent an ethnically defined group. However, the emergence of a number of multi-ethnic, class-based organisations over the last two decades has challenged this assumption, while raising questions about the ability of the institutional context to accommodate organisational change. Building on a neo-institutional theory of legitimacy, I examine the diverging legitimating strategies employed by two long-standing immigrant organisations based in Los Angeles (LA): the Korean Resource Center (KRC) and the Koreatown Immigrant Workers Alliance (KIWA). Through grant applications, organisational archival data and qualitative interviews, I show how KRC and KIWA, two groups embedded in the same sociopolitical context, have built unique yet equally successful legitimating accounts by adopting different organisational logics, one broadly based on ethnicity and one on class and multi-ethnicity. I suggest that KIWA and KRC's ideological differences, and their reliance on a different core of supporters - ethnic-oriented for KRC, labour-oriented for KIWA - drove the organisations towards distinct, yet partially overlapping subfields. By discursively mobilising those connections, and by actively shaping the surrounding organisational environment, both KRC and KIWA were able to incorporate in the broader non-profit advocacy sector in LA.

T1  - Successful yet insufficient: German policies for higher employment rates among older age groups
AN  - 1923937927
AB  - In recent years among the OECD countries, Germany has witnessed the largest increase in the employment rates of older people. This increase, and general German employment rates, are associated with both supply side measures in the fields of pensions and unemployment policies and employment promotion policies. Yet, supply side measures and Germany's shift from conservative towards liberal policy goals and policies in the case of older workers have resulted in economic inequality. These policies could be complemented by pro-employability measures in order to become fully effective. This article describes recent policy reforms in the main policy fields of retirement, unemployment, and employment promotion, considers their effects on employment and inequality, and offers reform suggestions to raise further older worker employment rates without increasing inequality.

T1  - Capitalism Hasn't Failed Us: Star Parker, the Housing Crisis, and Moral Hazard
AN  - 1800515161
AB  - According to legal scholar Sumi Cho, an important role conservatives of color play in the larger conservative movement is functioning in the role of racial mascots. Racial mascotting is when conservative individuals of color are embraced by their white peers with the purpose of helping to deflect charges of racism from critics. Conservative social activist Star Parker contends that the practice of welfare capitalism, as illustrated by the Community Reinvestment Act's mandate to banks to provide services to underserved minority and low income communities, was one factor that contributed to the subsequent housing crisis. Parker also asserts that mortgage relief programs, similar to other domestic social programs like welfare, produce a form of moral hazard among its recipients because both programs appear to reward an individual's poor behavior instead of making them accountable for their actions. I argue that in addition to Parker's analysis of the housing crisis being empirically flawed, her idealized construction of an American society functioning under the rule of laissez-faire capitalism where racism's impact on the opportunity chances of African Americans is minimal ultimately allows for the maintenance of an American social structure where 'whiteness' and racial inequality reign supreme.

T1  - Social integration of Australian Muslims: A dramaturgical perspective
AN  - 1798776750
AB  - This article presents a dramaturgical view of the social integration of minorities. Based on 30 interviews with prominent Australian Muslim leaders, we argue that they explain and approach the problem of social integration largely in presentational terms. As a corollary, their chief collective and political strategy towards social integration is to put forward alternative discourses to counter the dominant anti-Islam discourses. We use Goffman's (1959, 1963) dramaturgical model to analyse their strategies. In a striking difference from dominant narratives that situate Islamic values and western values as incompatible, the analysis we provide shows that Muslim leaders do not see Islamic teachings or texts as a problem for social integration; rather they view the problem as negative media representations and the solution as putting forward alternative images.

T1  - More than a paycheck: nannies, work, and identity
AN  - 1792351196
AB  - Nannies are paid childcare providers employed in private households. In Northeastern cities, they vary by many personal characteristics, including race, ethnicity, immigrant status, and education. This study compares the identity work of two groups of nannies: one composed of immigrant women of color and the other composed mainly of US-born white women. Building upon existing research on the difference between precarious work and precarious working conditions in domestic work, this study finds that immigrant women of color respond to disrespect and discrimination by defending the respectability of their work and their personal dignity. In contrast, US-born and white women respond to the stigma of doing socially devalued work by distancing themselves from their work. The implications of workers' agency and identity on organizing and social movements are considered.

T1  - Sources of Discrimination and Their Associations With Health in Sexual Minority Adults
AN  - 1788295328
AB  - Health disparities exist between sexual minorities and heterosexuals. These health disparities may be due to stressful social situations and environments that are created by discrimination. The current study recruited 277 sexual minorities to complete an online survey to examine the effects of discrimination on health. Discrimination from family and friends, compared to non-family and friends, was found to be more strongly associated with poorer health. This effect was partially statistically mediated by perceived stress reactivity. Findings from this study highlight the importance of distinguishing between different sources of discrimination when examining the effect of discrimination on health in sexual minority adults.

T1  - Body Control
AN  - 1793655851
AB  - This article genealogically explores the present dilemma of the queer migratory body with intersecting identities that carry a historical timeline of prejudice concerning body control based on foreign-born status, color, class, and sexual citizenship within a nation with a colonial history, the United States specifically. The social space effects of possessing multiple minority identities are expounded upon by charting past events, statutes, and prejudicial practices while correlating them to the social restrictions of free movement placed upon queer migratory bodies of color today. This article takes into consideration various forms of economic, social, and cultural capital-based inclusive entry fees into ethnically reflective urban space, queer urban space, and public urban space. This article also explores the social reactions of majority populations in situations that threaten the capitalist neocolonial power construct model and how this reaction impacts queer migratory bodies of color within urban spaces.

T1  - Educational and Labor Market Attainments of the 1.5- and Second-Generation Children of East Asian Immigrants in Canada: PROD
AN  - 1784933314
AB  - Using data from the most recent 2011 Canadian National Household Survey, educational, occupational, and earnings attainments of the East Asian 1.5- and second-generation groups are compared with those of the White third-plus generation. Specific attention is paid to those with both parents born in the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and in the Southeast Asian country of Vietnam. While East Asian offspring exhibit higher levels of education compared with the white third-plus generation and are more likely to have science and business majors, these more advantageous educational profiles relative to a White majority population do not mask economic inequality, as suggested by the model minority myth. Instead, for most groups a, straightforward model holds, in which higher educational levels and majors usually translate into higher chances of professional employment and higher earnings for the 1.5 and second generations in Canada.

T1  - Immigration and Its (Dis)Contents: The Challenges of Highly Skilled Migration in Globalizing Singapore: PROD
AN  - 1784933243
AB  - In the past three decades, the bid to develop Singapore into a global hub for high-tech, knowledge-intensive industries has underpinned Singapore's push to augment its local talent pool by attracting highly skilled transnational migrants. The ensuing influx of "foreign talent" into the "nation-city-state" has triggered major questions relating to social integration and cohesion, and raised implications for Singapore's demographic future and its "multiracial" identity. The article seeks to understand the politics of identity stemming from the increased presence of highly skilled migrants. After reviewing conceptualizations of the globally mobile "international talent" and tracing the key changes in Singapore's immigration-cum-labor policies (particularly those relating to highly skilled migrants), the article examines the fraught terrain on which the "integration" of highly skilled immigrants is staged, giving attention to the social dynamics of interaction between "foreign talent" and the "Singapore core" (popular terms often used in the media), the ensuing identity politics of inclusion and exclusion, and the slippages between the closure associated with building a "nation-state" and the openness critical to "global city" ambitions.

T1  - Attitudes towards Immigrant Workers and Asylum Seekers in Eastern Croatia: Dimensions, Determinants and Differences/Stavovi prema migrantskim radnicima i traziteljima azila u istocnoj Slavoniji: dimenzije, odrednice i razlike
AN  - 1794127140
AB  - Croatia's accession to the EU has brought new challenges and issues in researching and analysing migration flows and trends as well as attitudes and perceptions of real and potential newcomers. The aim of this paper is to explore attitudes of the residents of the two most easterly Croatian counties towards two distinct categories of newcomers: immigrant workers and asylum seekers. The research was conducted shortly after Croatia's entry into the EU, in September 2013, and the presented data are a part of a larger survey that included various migration and ethnicity issues. The survey was applied on a convenience sample of 1 110 adult respondents in two counties: Osijek-Baranja and Vukovar-Srijem. Data were analysed in a series of multivariate procedures. Results indicated significant perceptions of immigrant workers within the dimension of cultural threat, along with the expression of a considerable degree of social distance towards them.

T1  - A trilogy of trepidation: Diverse perspectives on police violence targeting African American males
AN  - 1751731146
AB  - "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" are supposedly "certain inalienable rights" that the Declaration of Independence claims have been gifted to all human beings by their Creator, and for which the U.S. government was created to protect. The issue of violence and brutality against African American males along with the police shooting of unarmed African American males has become a reality of the denial of these rights for some in America. Recent police shooting incidents of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, in addition to the brutal murder by police of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, have sparked riots, looting, protests, "die-ins," and national conversations. The subsequent civil unrest across the United States and abroad has attracted widespread public attention. In this article, three authors respond by providing a timely trilogy of uniquely diverse perspectives and viewpoints on these issues giving particular attention to (1) the view from a historical lens and Black Power political framework producing an analysis of the causative factors promoting and sustaining violence against African American males, (2) an examination of criminal justice law, and (3) a look at our way forward.

T1  - Politics of Land Grabbing: The Vested Property Act and the Exploitation of Hindu Communities in Bangladesh
AN  - 1855325787
AB  - The minority communities have been victimised in most of the countries of the sub-continent. Like other countries of the subcontinent, the minorities in Bangladesh have been subject to exploitation at times. This study explores the dynamics of the enactment of the Vested Properties Act 1974 from the historical perspective, identifying factors influencing the enactment of the Act in Bangladesh. The impact of the Act on the exploitation of the Hindu minority in Bangladesh is assessed. The study finds that as governments played political games with the Act, Hindu communities were systematically robbed of land using its provisions.

T1  - Minority Nations and Self-determination: A Proposal for the Regulation of Sovereignty Processes
AN  - 1855324743
AB  - Basque and Catalan demands for legitimising political accommodation, solely on the basis of the democratic will of their residents, poses a significant challenge to the Spanish constitutional system. The core of the debate in this kind of conflict revolves around the so-called "right to decide" which commonly finds its expression in the capacity to hold a referendum over sovereignty matters. The path opened by Quebec, Scotland and other minority nations are considered by some to constitute evidence of the democratic need to include this right as a new accommodation formula. Incorporating a "sovereigntist proceeding" into the legal system(s) may pave the way to a new framework aimed at solving the significant constitutional problems that exist in Spain and other countries. I suggest that such a procedure could be incorporated and regulated in the existing legal systems and provide some guidelines that could be adopted when drafting the aforementioned regulation.

T1  - Collective Victimization and Subjectivity in the Democratic Republic of Congo: Why Do Lasting Peace and Justice Remain Elusive?
AN  - 1855323454
AB  - The Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced patterns of mass victimization since the country's inception. As a private domain of King Leopold ii of Belgium, a Belgian colony or an independent state; the country has undergone numerous episodes of violence affecting not only individuals but also entire communities. Socio-political and economic crises have been accompanied by inter-ethnic violence, mostly in eastern provinces. Over the last decade, various mechanisms have been explored in attempts to address past atrocities. In addition to ongoing prosecutions before the International Criminal Court, a number of domestic initiatives have been or are still being explored. The present article examines the suitability of these mechanisms against the backdrop of the politically and ethnically fragmented landscape in the country. The inquiry examines whether domestic or international peace-building processes address not only individual forms of victimization but also subjective experiences and perceptions of collective victimhood.

T1  - Sexual Citizenship and Vulnerable Bodies in Makeda Silvera's The Heart Does Not Bend and Joan Riley's The Unbelonging: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1824184436
AB  - This article offers a literary and cultural studies approach to sexual citizenship and belonging through a reading of the coming-of-age genre. Coming-of-age narratives, a primary mode of a womanist Caribbean diaspora poetics, offer fruitful ground for an analysis of the relation of the individual and the state in their depictions of a protagonist's growing into sociocultural structures and internalizing normative frames of citizenship. The two novels investigated here, Makeda Silvera's The Heart Does Not Bend (2002) and Joan Riley's The Unbelonging (1985), reveal the interconnectedness of citizenship, sexuality, race, and bodily integrity in the Jamaican context, while also critically reflecting on those circumstances under which access to sexual rights is either granted or denied. I argue that a focus on women's sexual citizenship in literature expands formal notions of citizenship, taking into equal account racism, sexism, classism, and uneven capital distribution as intersecting categories affecting the practice of acting as and the status of being a citizen. Applying to contemporary Caribbean women's writing the analytical category of sexual citizenship thus engenders a feminist, politically engaged reading of these texts that not only recovers silenced stories of sexual violence and racialized oppression, but also foregrounds women's embodied subjectivity.

T1  - Keeping Up Appearances Within the Ethnic Community: A Disconnect between First and Second Generation South Asians' Educational Aspirations
AN  - 1815479247
AB  - Second generation South Asian youth are defined as part of the model minority based on their educational success in Canada and elsewhere. The literature explaining these successes highlight parental pressures as a determinant. Based on a qualitative study of South Asian second generation youth in Toronto, we examine their educational experiences, and their interpretations of these experiences. We find that there is a disconnect between the first and second generations' motivation for academic achievement, which causes significant intergenerational tensions. Our findings lend support to the arguments that immigrant parents often exert authoritative influence on their children's educational paths; however, our findings also shed light on why the second generation might interpret these pressures as problematic. We argue that among our participants, the tension is not simply about the educational pressures themselves but more so their origin: their parents' collectivist concerns about family status and prestige. The pressure to please their parents in order to impress the ethnic community is what these second generation youth feel is so problematic and contributes to intergenerational tension. The findings indicate the need to approach second generation experiences using new lenses, particularly by synthesizing understandings of their educational outcomes with their realities of being embedded in collective communities. By way of conclusion, the impact on migrant settlement processes across generations is discussed.Alternate abstract:Les jeunes sud-asiatiques de la deuxième génération sont définis comme un modèle de minorité basé sur leur réussite scolaire au Canada et ailleurs. Expliquant ces succès, la littérature met en exergue les pressions parentales comme facteurs déterminants. Basée sur une étude qualitative des jeunes sud-asiatiques de la deuxième génération dans la ville de Toronto, nous examinons leurs expériences éducatives et leurs interprétations de ces expériences. Nous trouvons qu'il y a un décalage entre la première et la seconde génération sur le plan de la motivation et des atteintes des objectifs éducatifs, ce qui engendre des tensions intergénérationnelles significatives. Nos résultats corroborent les arguments selon lesquels les parents immigrants exercent souvent une autorité évidente sur le parcours éducatif de leurs enfants. Cependant, nos résultats mettent également en lumière les raisons qui pousseraient la deuxième génération à interpréter ces pressions comme étant problématiques. Nous soutenons que parmi nos participants, les tensions ne surviennent pas seulement des pressions éducatives mais beaucoup plus de leurs origines : les préoccupations collectivistes de leurs parents au sujet de la situation familiale et du prestige. La pression de faire plaisir à leurs parents dans le but d'impressionner la communauté ethnique est ce que ressent les jeunes de la deuxième génération et qui par conséquent est si problématique et intensifie les tensions entre les générations. Les résultats indiquent ainsi la nécessité d'aborder l'expérience de la seconde génération avec un regard nouveau, notamment en synthétisant la compréhension de leurs résultats scolaires avec leurs réalités d'être intégrés dans les communautés collectives. En guise de conclusion, l'impact sur le processus d'intégration des immigrants est examiné.

T1  - Climate Change, Mining and Traditional Indigenous Knowledge in Australia
AN  - 1778777638
AB  - Australia, in common with nations globally, faces an immediate and future environmental and economic challenge as an outcome of climate change. Indigenous communities in Australia, some who live a precarious economic and social existence, are particularly vulnerable to climate change. Impacts are already being experienced through dramatic weather events such as floods and bushfires. Other, more gradual changes, such as rising sea levels in the north of Australia, will have long-term negative consequences on communities, including the possibility of forced relocation. Climate change is also a historical phenomenon, and Indigenous communities hold a depth of knowledge of climate change and its impact on local ecologies of benefit to the wider community when policies to deal with an increasingly warmer world are considered. Non-Indigenous society must respect this knowledge and facilitate alliances with Indigenous communities based on a greater recognition of traditional knowledge systems.

AN  - 1722193790
AB  - Gypsies, Travellers and Roma are amongst the most marginalised and vulnerable groups in society presenting something of a bellwether, an indicator of the fairness of society. This article charts the development of One Nation Conservatism in the post-war period and relations between the Conservative Party and Gypsies, Travellers and Roma communities to gain insights into the philosophical and moral influences on the current party of government in the UK. It draws on a recent report monitoring UK progress in achieving equality and inclusion for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma groups and concludes that the potential dilution of social justice and human rights agendas will accentuate exclusion.

T1  - 'Smoke and Mirrors': Conditional Inclusion, Model Minorities, and the Pre-1965 Dismantling of Asian Exclusion
AN  - 1767327999; 201605985
AB  - DALIP SINGH SAUND (1899-1973) set several precedents in American history. Most famously, the Punjab native defeated five opponents to gain election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1956. Twice re-elected to represent California's 29th Congressional district, he earned the distinction of being the first Sikh, Indian American, and Asian American to hold national office. His three successful campaigns were startling accomplishments considering that these very groups had been widely regarded by Americans as the 'Hindu invasion,' 'brown hordes,' and 'aliens ineligible to citizenship' since the beginning of the twentieth century. What had been unthinkable until 1946, the year Indian nationals became eligible for naturalized citizenship, became a reality just a few short years later. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Uneven Citizenship: Minorities and Migrants in the Post-Yugoslav Space
AN  - 1667948481; 201509557
AB  - The special issue revolves around the relations between citizenship and various manifestations of diversity including, but going beyond, ethnicity. A number of interesting recent attempts to rethink citizenship are addressed by the addition of 'uneven citizenship' to the debate. While referring to uneven citizenship the special issue not only engages with exclusionary legal, political and social practices but also other unanticipated or unaccounted for results of citizenship policies. The individual papers address statuses, rights, and duties of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees, Roma, 'claimed co-ethnics' as well as various interactions between dominant and non-dominant groups in the post-Yugoslav space.

T1  - Paths of Integration for Sexual Minorities in Korea
AN  - 1735655209; 201536933
AB  - The prevailing social model among the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) in South Korea is to maintain somewhat sexually free but separate social enclaves. This strategy avoids significant public backlash and government oppression. However, the situation leaves them without legal protection, social acceptance or significant public space for expressing their sexual identity. Supporters of greater integration pursue a politically activist model, which advocates government recognition and protection of the LGBT as an oppressed minority. This strategy faces determined opposition from some Christian groups and a mostly indifferent public. We highlight a complementary 'bridging-dialogue' model in which individual LGBT persons nurture communicative social ties with members of the larger society in ostensibly non-political settings. Although emerging and limited, the bridging strategy attracts many more participants than does identity politics and generates genuine dialogue and other social exchange among different groups, including conservative Christians and foreign-origin LGBTs. Bridging dialogue also appeals to a younger generation of Koreans, who are more tolerant of and curious about ethnic and sexual diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Ukrainian Canadian in London: Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky and the Ukrainian Bureau, 1931-40
AN  - 1749279035
AB  - This paper examines a crucial and formative decade in the life of Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky (1896–1976), a Ukrainian-Canadian newspaper editor, lobbyist, university professor, and historian, who is most familiar to Canadian researchers as the federal civil servant responsible for liaison with ethnic groups and the ethnic press during the early years of the Cold War. It argues that the attitudes and methods (Kaye) Kysilewsky brought to his job as a liaison officer were shaped by his experience as director of the Ukrainian Bureau in London. There, during the 1930s, he met and was counselled by a number of British parliamentarians, academics, and journalists, as he attempted to bring to public attention the murderous famine in Soviet Ukraine (which was denied by the Stalinist regime) and as he tried to contend with the Bureau’s obstreperous Ukrainian émigré rivals, in particular the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN).Alternate abstract:Cet article porte sur une décade cruciale et formative dans la vie de Vladimir J. (Kaye) Kysilewsky (1896–1976) qui fut rédacteur en chef de journal, lobbyiste, professeur d’université et historien, et que les chercheurs canadiens connaissent surtout en tant que fonctionnaire fédéral responsable de la liaison avec les groupes et la presse ethniques au cours des premières années de la guerre froide. L’article montre comment l’attitude et les méthodes que (Kaye) Kysilewsky a employées dans son travail d’officier de liaison ont été modelées par son expérience de directeur du Bureau ukrainien à Londres. Là-bas, dans les années 1930, il a rencontré un certain nombre de parlementaires britanniques, d’universitaires et de journalistes et a été conseillés par eux, alors qu’il s’efforçait d’attirer l’attention du public sur la famine meurtrière qui sévissait dans l’Ukraine soviétique (et qui était niée par le régime stalinien) et qu’il essayait de composer avec des rivaux du Bureau, émigrés ukrainiens turbulents, dont particulièrement l’Organisation des Ukrainiens nationalistes (OUN).

T1  - "Letters from the Old Country": Exploring and Defining Ukrainian Canadian Vernacular Letter Writing
AN  - 1749278926
AB  - Ukrainian Canadians have been exchanging letters with their overseas relatives for as long as they have been in Canada. Despite the fact that transatlantic family correspondence has continued since the days of early settlement of the Ukrainians in Canada, scholars have little understanding of how this vernacular practice of modernity has been lived out by the Ukrainian Canadians. Similarly, there is even less understanding of how transatlantic letter writing has affected individuals, families, and communities on both sides of the Atlantic. This article addresses the existing gap in the scholarship with respect to the study of the immigrant letter, and offers a general overview of the phenomenon of transnational family letter writing in the Ukrainian Canadian context as well as outlining the challenges in searching and studying the letters as cultural artifacts.Alternate abstract:Les Canadiens ukrainiens ont maintenu des échanges des lettres avec leurs membres de familles outre-mer depuis qu’ils sont au Canada. Malgré le fait que cette correspondance familiale transatlantique se soit maintenue depuis le temps des premiers colons ukrainiens au Canada, les chercheurs ne saisissent pas vraiment comment ces Canadiens ont vécu une telle tradition vernaculaire sur le long terme. De même, il y a encore une faible compréhension de la manière dont cette correspondance transatlantique a affecté les personnes, les familles et les communautés des deux côtés de l’Atlantique. Cet article porte sur les lacunes dont souffre la recherche concernant l’étude des lettres d’immigrants et offre un aperçu général du phénomène de la correspondance familiale transnationale dans le contexte canadien ukrainien, ainsi que des grandes lignes des défis posés à la recherche et à l’étude de ces lettres en tant qu’objets culturels.

T1  - Transnational families and the subjective well-being of migrant parents: Angolan and Nigerian parents in the Netherlands
AN  - 1722763372
AB  - Studies on transnational families argue that the subjective well-being of migrant parents is negatively affected by living separated from their children. Most studies employ qualitative methods without a control group and hence are not able to distinguish whether the effects found are associated with separation only or with other factors. This paper investigates the association between parental subjective well-being and parent-child separation by comparing migrant parents who have at least one child in their country of origin with those who live with all their children in the Netherlands. The paper further investigates whether the same associations are found between migrant groups from Angola and Nigeria. Results indicate that transnational parents indeed report lower subjective well-being, as measured by happiness, life satisfaction and mental health for both groups and additionally, self-assessed health for Angolans. However, legal status, socio-economic status and the quality of the parent-child relationship are found to be important mediators.

T1  - Race, Self-Selection, and the Job Search Process
AN  - 1718065416; 201530755
AB  - While existing research has documented persistent barriers facing African-American job seekers, far less research has questioned how job seekers respond to this reality. Do minorities self-select into particular segments of the labor market to avoid discrimination? Such questions have remained unanswered due to the lack of data available on the positions to which job seekers apply. Drawing on two original data sets with application-specific information, we find little evidence that blacks target or avoid particular job types. Rather, blacks cast a wider net in their search than similarly situated whites, including a greater range of occupational categories and characteristics in their pool of job applications. Additionally, we show that perceptions of discrimination are associated with increased search breadth, suggesting that broad search among African-Americans represents an adaptation to labor market discrimination. Together these findings provide novel evidence on the role of race and self-selection in the job search process. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Methodological puzzles of surveying Roma/Gypsy populations
AN  - 1700674402; 201525264
AB  - European countries as well as the European Union are continually striving for comparable and reliable statistics about Roma, which is a precondition to efficiently support the design and implementation of national and European Union wide inclusion strategies and sectorial policies as well as monitoring their outcomes. This article aims to provide an overview of the theoretical and practical challenges researchers need to face in the course of designing and conducting survey among 'Roma' populations. A number of factors - such as dilemmas about the definition of the target population, methodology of sampling of a population with multiple and threatened identity, difficulties of constructing comparable indicators - have led to greatly diverging outcomes of various 'Roma' surveys in terms of the most essential statistics, such as the size of the population, geographical dispersion, level of poverty, level of education and employment rate. This article will summarize the various methodological decisions that research has to make by providing illustrative examples of recent research in Hungary, Romania and the European Union. It attempts to demonstrate the actual consequences of methodological decisions in terms of the varying outcomes of a crucial indicator - employment rate - produced by six independent surveys. The article's conclusions are further reaching: data on Roma minorities are a requirement for evidence-based, efficient policy making targeted at social inclusion of Roma in Europe, and therefore understanding methodological dilemmas in the collection of this data is essential.

T1  - Talking Like a Generation: The 'Documentary' Meaning of Ethnicity for Aging Minority Britons
AN  - 1692288052; 201521355
AB  - This article contributes to the 'cognitive turn' in the study of ethnicity and national identity, which focuses on how individuals construct ethnic identity categories pertinent to social cohesion. Using Mannheim as a methodological and analytical guide, we show how examining ethnicity as a relational enactment devoid of a priori categorisations allows situational identities that intersect with classical sociological concepts other than ethnicity - namely generation, class, and citizenship - to emerge within and across typical ethnic categorisations. We draw on an analysis of micro-level interactions among 40 aging 'black and minority ethnics' (BMEs) engaging in small-group discussions and a large deliberative assembly held in London in 2011.

T1  - A decade of suspicion: Islam and Muslims in Denmark after 9/11
AN  - 1667949847; 201509613
AB  - In 2011, al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, was killed in Pakistan and the US president, Barack Obama, concluded a decade of global 'war against terror'. In light of this, it seems only sensible to explore what implications the post-9/11 international developments have had on a local basis in specific national contexts. With this in mind, this article focuses on Denmark and discusses how the critical event of 9/11 motivated a security/integration response, including various pre-emptive measures that have cast the Muslim population as the usual suspects. It will discuss how these changes have affected the everyday lives of ordinary Danish Muslims over the last ten years and changed the relationship between majorities and minorities. Finally, it will also examine how and why recent national and international events have created the potential for another shift in majority-minority relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Hong Kong Muslims on Hajj: Rhythms of the Pilgrimage 2.0 and Experiences of Spirituality Among Twenty-First Century Global Cities
AN  - 1667952294; 201509591
AB  - The pilgrimage to Mecca is an often-overlooked topic in the study of Muslim minorities. This work looks at the experiences of Muslims in Hong Kong who make up a multi-ethnic community situated in a densely populated urban metropolis in China. As a small community, these Muslims are free from the constraints of the hajj quota system that most countries are subjected to. The organisation and experiences of these pilgrims is contrasted with recent developments in Mecca, including urban development and communications infrastructure to serve the pilgrims. The twenty-first century hajj, as 'pilgrimage 2.0', characterises some of the contemporary challenges that modern hajj poses. These insights are contrasted with Lefebvre's concept of rhythm analysis to highlight themes of permanence and change. In addressing the similarities of both Mecca and Hong Kong as 'global cities', the experiences of Hong Kong Muslims are made distinct. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnicity and place in a 'disturbed city': ways of belonging in Imphal, Manipur
AN  - 1660023566; 201505719
AB  - This article explores the relationships between ethnicity, place and belonging in the city of Imphal, capital of the state of Manipur in India's Northeast border region. Manipur has experienced decades of conflict from ethno-nationalist separatism, inter-ethnic territorial disputes and counter-insurgency operations. These ethnic conflicts play out on the urban landscape of Imphal. Control of the city from above is diffused among the civilian government and the armed forces. Non-state actors such as insurgent groups and ethnic organizations exert their own control from below. On such unstable ground, struggles by residents seeking to create place and a sense of belonging affirm ethnic boundaries. These boundaries are not static and the lines between inclusion and exclusion are continually redrawn along existing and emerging fault-lines among the population. Yet these boundaries are also transcended in unusual ways that may seem trivial but in Imphal are essential to realizing alternative ways of belonging. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'It's the Demography, Stupid': Ethnic Change and Opposition to Immigration
AN  - 1667953508; 201509544
AB  - It is often forgotten that, regardless of time or place, periods of high immigration are almost always periods of high anti-immigration sentiment. When ethnic change is rapid, driven by immigration or differences in ethnic natural increase, the ethnic majority often responds with a politics of immigration. This was true, for instance, in Britain in the 1960s, in the US during 1890-1925 and in interwar Scotland. I show that White British people in locales experiencing rapid ethnic change are more likely to call for lower immigration and to vote BNP. On the other hand, where there is already a high level of ethnic minorities, white opinion is less hostile to immigration: UKIP does poorly among whites in diverse areas. Habituation to change, typically within a decade, and assimilation-especially of Europeans-over a generation reduces hostility to immigration. If the rate of ethnic change slows, we should therefore expect a reduction in the salience of immigration. Ironically, because the children of European migrants are more readily accepted into the ethnic majority than is the case for non-Europeans, a shift from EU free movement to non-European skilled migrants, as is advocated by UKIP, could run counter to the wishes of its own supporters.

AB  - This response to Julie Ringelheim's (2011) article on methods of collecting ethnic statistics focuses on her use of Northern Ireland as a precedent for the rest of Europe. In Northern Ireland the Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities, backed by Council of Europe experts, has sanctioned methods other than voluntary self-identification. Before drawing broader lessons from this derogation of self-identification, attention should be paid to the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland and to scholarly debate on the consequences of this derogation.

T1  - What Does Difference Have to Do with Community? Derrida's Diacritic Difference
AN  - 1750223970
AB  - This essay explores the ways in which difference can be preserved within a community. It departs from Jacques Derrida's critique of the image of community as immediately present to itself, without difference and his criticism on the minorities which identify themselves with other oppressed minority communities in the name of the universal. Through Derrida, it discusses other strategies of difference which can no longer be related to a community identity. From this perspective, the essay attempts to portray difference as a diacritical mark in a selection of photographic and filmic works: Frédéric Brenner's Diaspora and Jo Sol's Fake Orgasm. Do Frédéric Brenner's Jewish visual archive and Jo Sol's film on sexuality seek to measure the stakes of the diacritic difference in common?

T1  - Japanese Women Migrants in Australia: Situating the Self between Ethnicity and Femininity
AN  - 1728661093; 201534118
AB  - Based on fieldwork in Sydney, Australia, this paper discusses the ways in which Japanese women marriage migrants remold their gender identity in the process of settlement. Among recent Japanese migrants to Australia, women migrants, i.e., those who migrated to Australia on account of their marriage to an Australian resident or citizen, constitute the largest number. Their settlement experience suggests navigating relationships and interactions with the local ethnic Japanese community, their cross-cultural family, and the host community. In the process, they situate themselves in daily life through their gendered identity, which assumes as important a role as ethnicity. The maternal role is central in defining their identity in Australia, although for some, this essentialized identity creates ambivalence about the self in the host society.

The present article is an attempt to research (a) what exactly the differences between the instruments protecting national minorities and the instruments protecting migrants are in one specific area, education, and (b) to what extent the general inclusiveness of human rights instruments has influenced or should influence the specific instruments pertaining to the protection of educational rights of migrants and national minorities.

T1  - Europe against the Roma
AN  - 1512220834; 201408794
AB  - The ancient hatred of Roma minorities is now being compounded in Europe by a post-austerity fear of the destitute 'scrounger'. Romani communities, many consisting of those forced by market economics and far-right politics to flee westwards from former 'eastern bloc' countries, facilitated in the latter 2000s by the free movement enabled by accession to the EU, now find themselves the victims of open hostility to 'foreigners' and state-sponsored removal. The author examines the variations of anti-Roma prejudice and state strategies in southern, eastern and western Europe, which send the Roma from pillar to post.

T1  - Income Inequality, International Migration, and National Pride: A Test of Social Identification Theory
AN  - 1559005885; 201432585
AB  - Does the income inequality of a country increase the nationalistic sentiments of its citizens? If so, why do people become more nationalistic when inequality grows? This article answers these questions, which have been historically observed and theoretically suggested, but rarely answered with empirical tests. By borrowing formal models in Shayo (2009) and using a multilevel analysis method with survey data in multiple years, this article shows that income inequality increases the national pride of poor people, which is an essential aspect of nationalistic sentiments, particularly in countries whose lower class has many migrants. This result implies that the link between income inequality, income levels, and nationalistic sentiments may be shaped by other social features such as the level of migration.

T1  - Interest-divergence and the colour of cutbacks: race, recession and the undeclared war on Black children
AN  - 1520342875; 201413097
AB  - Drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) and illustrating with examples from the English system, the paper addresses the hidden racist dimension to contemporary education reforms and argues that this is a predictable and recurrent theme at times of economic crisis. Derrick Bell's concept of 'interest-convergence' argues that moments of racial progress are won when White power-holders perceive self-interest in accommodating the demands of minoritised groups; such moments are unusual and often short-lived. Presently, we are witnessing the reverse of this process; a period of pronounced interest-divergence, when White power-holders imagine that a direct advantage will accrue from the further exclusion and oppression of Black groups in society. Behind rhetoric that proclaims the need to improve educational standards for all and celebrates a commitment to closing the existing achievement gaps; in reality education reforms are being enacted that systematically disadvantage Black students and demonstrably widen educational inequalities.

T1  - "Where We Have Come and Are Now Trapped": Views of Victims and Service Providers on Abuse of Older Adults in Tamil and Punjabi Families
AN  - 1463013056; 201345880
AB  - This paper contributes to the literature on the intersections of age, generation, immigrant status, and racialization. In particular, it will bring into the discussion: (1) the perspectives of victims and service providers on the causes of, barriers to, and alleviation of abuse of older adults; and (2) continuities and changes in the social meanings of age, including the intersectionalities between age and other social hierarchies, such as immigrant status and membership in a racialized group. Using data obtained from a study consisting of interviews of service providers, and older adult abuse victims in the Toronto Punjabi and Tamil communities, this paper seeks to answer questions regarding the causes of family violence, barriers to obtaining services, and proposed solutions. The main themes arising from the respondents' views fall within structural and cultural categories, with language barriers, the role of culture, and stigmatization among others emerging as key factors. Importantly, the data suggests that there exists a disconnect between victims and service providers, with the majority of victims supporting an anti-racist approach, while the majority of service providers fall within the multicultural model. This study suggests that the problem of abuse of older adults is compounded by deficient service provision and government policy. The recommended solution is to reach beyond culturally and linguistically specific services toward full engagement with immigrant communities, to prevent further harm toward older immigrant adults.

T1  - Identifying stylizations in ethnically salient talk among disc jockeys
AN  - 1429630035; 201335693
AB  - Before accepting claims of the function of linguistic stylization, it is imperative that we are certain of what we are examining. Mikhail Bakhtin's widely cited definition that stylization is an "artistic representation of another's linguistic style" (1986:362) leaves unclear what counts as "artistic," making identifying stylizations simultaneously intuitively obvious and empirically illusive. Drawing from 270 hours of data from a radio program, the current study uses interactional discourse and acoustic analyses to compare one disc jockey's exaggerations of ethnically salient accents (stylizations) with his mundane use of reported speech. The analyses demonstrate that in both types of talk he uses a similar bundle of interactional and acoustic resources to design his talk as belonging to someone else. The link between reported and stylized speech places stylizations in an analytical category distinct from that of crossing and its issues of language ownership. The pertinent questions are those of speaker responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic mobilisation for decolonisation: colonial legacy (the case of the Zo people in Northeast India)
AN  - 1417525854; 201332030
AB  - This article attempts to communicate the methodological tension between subjectivity and objectivity by recording the aspiration of communities who are problematised both by colonialism and the modern nation-state. It highlights how colonial policy and practice contribute to the postcolonial imbroglio in Northeast India. It delineates how British colonial cartography always gave priority to 'administrative convenience' in the demarcation of boundaries, resulting in the division of ethnic community. It argues that Northeast India and the Indo-Burma borderland are not yet decolonised, as the government of India, without any rearrangement or alteration, adopts the colonial administrative boundaries, which divided ethnic communities. Neither the State Reorganisation Act (1956) nor the North-Eastern Areas (Reorganisation) Act (1971) fulfilled the aspiration of the segmented communities in the northeast, as they did in the mainland. The article also argues that the responses of the government of India towards the problems in Northeast India react to the manifested symptoms of the deep-rooted political problem rather than getting to the crux of the problem to find a solution.

T1  - Ethnic identities and the dynamics of regional and sub-regional assertions in Jammu and Kashmir
AN  - 1417525406; 201332095
AB  - The concept of regional and sub-regional identity as well as regional autonomy has captured the stage of Social Science. The regional autonomy aspirations and the sense of regional and sub-regional identity have offered a new dimension to the assertiveness of ethnic group. Regional identity demands in South and Southeast Asian societies have followed a uniform pattern. These regional autonomy demands evolved over a large span of time may be located in specific geographical and environmental spaces. At one level, these demands remained humane and inclusive, incorporating and reflecting broader human and universal values. At the other level, they acquired the traits of particularism which in the later stages of building multi-cultural and multi-ethnic nation states posed many problems. The plurality of politics is the hallmark of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) State, and this polarity is essentially the result of cultural diversities that criss-cross the geographical and cultural landscape of Kashmir. The J&K State is not only a conglomerate of three distinct regions -- Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh -- but there are also regions within regions marked off from one another by geography, culture, and history. The politics of regional and sub-regionalism based on region, religion, caste, ethnicity, and so on continues to be stubbornly informed by their respective histories and cultures -- thus the resistance against hegemony and the demand for sub-regional autonomies and Hill Development Councils. This article attempts at, looking into the dynamics of these assertions, its impact on the politics of the state, and to delineate the role of different socio-political and historical forces in shaping regional and sub-regional assertions in J&K without, however, suppressing the relative significance of different identity markers.

T1  - Vigilance and Apprehension: Multiculturalism, Democracy, and the 'Kurdish Question' in Turkey
AN  - 1364702703; 201323517
AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the 'Kurdish question' in Turkey within the framework of the current debates on the 'death of multiculturalism'. Contra what I would call 'multikulti-sceptics', I contend that it is too early to compose an epitaph for multiculturalism, both as practice and as ideology, that there is no binary opposition between a form of rights-based multiculturalism on the one hand, and universal human rights, democratic constitutionalism or social cohesion on the other. The paper also focuses on 'multicultural constitutional citizenship,' based on democratic deliberation and dialogue, as a solution to Kurdish demands for the public recognition of their identities. I juxtapose Kurdish claims with similar demands made by national minorities in other contexts, and conclude by delineating the normative contours of multicultural constitutional citizenship and outlining the practical measures that are required to sustain it.

T1  - Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage
AN  - 1347783254; 201321499
AB  - This study examines the effect that the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, congregations, and friendships has on whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage with blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Utilizing survey data drawn from a national probability sample, ordered logit regression models are estimated in order to (1) determine the effect of the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, and congregations on white intermarriage attitudes, net of sociodemographic and ideological controls and (2) test for a mediating effect of interracial friendship. Greater presence of blacks, Latinos, or Asians in neighborhoods and congregations of whites predicts favorable attitudes among whites toward interracial marriage with each respective racial group. A higher proportion of Latinos in the workplace also predicts support for racial exogamy with Latinos. Many of these effects, however, are reduced when interracial friendship is included in models, suggesting that the effect of interracial contact on intermarriage attitudes is mediated by whether or not whites develop interracial friendships within settings of cross-race interaction.

T1  - National Identity and Immigration Policy: Concern for Legality or Ethnocentric Exclusion
AN  - 1347781312; 201322169
AB  - Does support for tough policies against undocumented immigration reflect anti-immigrant sentiments or a neutral concern about upholding laws? This study addresses the question by examining the relationship between different expressions of national identification and ethnocentric enforcement bias-that is, support for punishment of law-breaking immigrants but not law-breaking American employers who knowingly hire undocumented immigrants. Results revealed an association of this enforcement bias with nationalism (an ethnocentric engagement with national identity) but not with patriotism (a more critical engagement with national identity). A moderation analysis indicated that the relationship between nationalism and ethnocentric enforcement bias was most evident among participants who endorsed a "culture"-based construction of American identity in terms of American citizenship and ability to speak English. Discussion focuses on policy developments that reflect a symbolic threat to culture-based constructions of American identity and on the implications for fair and just enforcement of immigration policy.

T1  - School co-ethnicity and Hispanic parental involvement
AN  - 1429629962; 201335763
AB  - Scholars of immigration disagree about the role ethnic communities play in immigrant families' engagement in educational institutions. While some researchers argue that the concentration of disadvantaged ethnic groups may prevent meaningful engagement with schools, others argue that ethnic communities can possess resources that help immigrant families be involved in their children's schooling. In this study we use a nationally representative dataset of Hispanic children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) to determine if the relative size of the Hispanic population in the school affects levels of their parents' involvement in their education, as well as parents' perceptions of barriers to their involvement. Our results suggest that a large Hispanic presence in a child's school can help increase immigrant Hispanic parents' involvement in their children's schooling, but there are no benefits for US-born Hispanic parents, indicating that ethnic communities help immigrant families acculturate to American institutions.

T1  - The Understudied Case of Black Professional Men: Advocating an Intersectional Approach
AN  - 1322717879; 201310876
AB  - This paper considers potential new areas for sociology of work research. Specifically, we review some key studies in the sociology of work that identify the processes by which workplaces and labor markets recreate racial and gendered inequality. We then examine the ways that intersectionality theory has generated additional insights into how certain groups are disadvantaged at work. Finally, we make the case that using an intersectional approach to explore the occupational challenges, opportunities, and issues facing black professional men offers a new and important direction for research in the sociology of work.

T1  - Re-making the majority? Ethnic New Zealanders in the 2006 census
AN  - 1283642662; 201303368
AB  - The national census is often seen as a site of struggle for minorities seeking recognition and equality. Much less is known about the conditions under which ethnic majorities are galvanized to stake identity claims in the census. This article examines recent trends in New Zealand where an increasing number of people from the dominant New Zealand European group are redefining themselves as ethnic New Zealanders. Drawing from the literature on ethnic boundaries, we theorize the factors underlying the surge in New Zealander identification, and present census data to demonstrate its selective appeal. We also review patterns of national naming in North America and Australia to show that the New Zealander phenomenon reflects a broader shift by settler state majorities to reimagine their identities. The implications for ethnic counting in other contexts are briefly considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The limits of post-national citizenship: European Muslims, human rights and the hijab
AN  - 1567049504; 201435102
AB  - Innovative approaches to citizenship emerged in the 1990s. Post-national theory suggested that European minorities no longer needed national citizenship because supra-national political structures such as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) offered them protections. Denationalized citizenship held that universal human rights were now available at the national level too as the Council of Europe's member countries had to incorporate human rights principles within their own jurisdictions. New forms of claims-making among European Muslims were cited as evidence of this trend as religious claims, especially relating to the hijab, began to be made through human rights litigation. This paper demonstrates the limits of post-nationalism through a discussion of the outcomes of such claims. While European Muslims are indeed mobilizing around human rights, there is no evidence -- at the level of litigation -- that this has helped them to win recognition of their religious or cultural rights. This paper explores the reasons for this. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cross-Cultural Family Structure among Muslim, Hindu, Santal, and Oraon Communities in Rasulpur, Bangladesh
AN  - 1551002017; 201429128
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare family structure patterns among Muslim, Hindu, Santal, and Oraon communities in rural Bangladesh. For this we hypothesized that family structure patterns-marriage, family type and size, residence, role sharing, authority, communication, and property distribution-were not only significantly different but that these patterns of the family structure were also significantly interrelated among the ethnic communities in rural Bangladesh. In so doing 585 males of the ethnic communities selected by cluster random sampling were intensively interviewed with a semi-structural questionnaire in Rasulpur of Bangladesh. Results of Pearson chi-square testing suggest that the family structure patterns were significantly varied. The results of Spearman bivariate correlation coefficients also suggest that the family structure patterns were significantly interrelated among the communities in rural Bangladesh. Further cross-cultural research should be conducted on why and how family structure patterns are significantly different among the communities in Bangladesh. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Integration of Immigrant Children into Inter-ethnic Friendship Networks: The Role of 'Intergenerational Openness'
AN  - 1081864564; 201235404
AB  - Social network data from class-based interviews of N = 257 10-year-old students in N = 4382 directed dyads show that the propensity for being friends is moderately affected by ethnic heterogeneity. However, the likelihood of acquaintanceship among children's parents is strongly reduced in ethnically heterogeneous dyads. This has been referred to as 'intergenerational openness' of networks in the work of J.S. Coleman. It will be shown that intergenerational openness has a strong negative association with mutual invitations to birthday parties, which are assumed to play an important role in the process of cross-generational social integration. Accordingly, intergenerational openness indicates a 'gap in social integration' between generations and corresponds negatively with the social integration of immigrant children.

T1  - Stop "blaming the man": perceptions of inequality and opportunities for success in the Obama era among middle-class African Americans
AN  - 1037875396; 201231255
AB  - This paper builds upon work that has shown that African Americans exhibit a dual consciousness when explaining persistent inequality. We draw upon 45 in-depth interviews with middle-class African Americans following the 2008 election to explore how they explain persistent disadvantage for African Americans, the destigmatization strategies they employ, and the impact they believe the election of Barack Obama will have on opportunities for African Americans. Consistent with dual consciousness theory, we find that respondents explain persistent disadvantage for African Americans by citing structural and motivational factors. We also extend previous work to show that for the majority of respondents the use of individualistic de-stigmatization strategies reinforces their dual consciousness. These respondents are optimistic about Obama's election because it supports their belief that African Americans should assume responsibility for improving their circumstances. A minority of respondents express more concern about the persistence of racial inequality, and consequentially are less optimistic about changes that Obama's election may bring about.

T1  - Turkish Migrants and Native Germans Compared: The Effects of Inter-Ethnic and Intra-Ethnic Friendships on the Transition from Unemployment to Work
AN  - 1766830199
AB  - In this paper, we analyse whether having inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic friendships can be associated with a shorter duration of unemployment, comparing Turkish migrants and native residents in Germany. This allows us to examine the degree to which the returns from bridging and bonding social capital differ for the two groups. On the basis of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) data, we find that for native Germans, intra-ethnic friendships shorten the duration of spells of unemployment, whereas inter-ethnic friendships do not. For the Turkish migrants, inter-ethnic friendships reduce the duration of unemployment, whereas intra-ethnic friendships do not. In other words, only friendships with German natives facilitate the transition to employment, but in particular for Turkish migrants. This effect is largest for migrants with a low level of education.

T1  - Factoring Turbulence Out: Diaspora Regulatory Mechanism and Migration Development Bank
AN  - 1766830154
AB  - The ongoing economic crisis has shifted much of the policy debate to problems of financial sector regulation, productive capacity collapse, among others. However, this leaves unattended the real situation with labour migration, which directly impacts social and economic inner components of being of millions of individual families across the world. The somewhat ad hoc nature of the process poses several policy issues for the home and host economies alike. Immediate concerns relate to streamlining migrants and remittances flows. This involves sensitive aspects of inequality in migrant workers' labour efforts vis-à-vis domestic workers; migrants' social and legal status; and less obvious, but still profound, unproductive misallocation of labour resources. Derived from this premise and recognizing the need for an institutional approach, this paper offers alternative policy solutions to temporary labour migration regulation. This research's original propositions include a Diaspora Regulatory Mechanism and a Migration Development Bank, both operating within a state-managed temporary labour migration regime. Fiscal action, including multilateral agreements, is crucial. The functionality of these mechanisms will directly impact infrastructure, human capital and entrepreneurial projects development in both home and host economies. Discussion is inspired by the analysis of actual circumstances in the economies of the Commonwealth of Independent States, where migration is a social, economic, and increasingly political issue. In the interlinked world, diasporas become dominant actors across all society strata. The development plateau of the post-socialist states offers a rich economic and social soil to conduct responsible policy with future outlook. Moreover, conditions of ongoing economic crisis offer a unique opportunity for daring research to propose and for a motivated decisionmaker to implement original, proactive, and beneficial policy solutions aimed at streamlining the (temporary) labour migration process. This paper contributes to the emerging literature on topics of diaspora, labour migration, and remittance flows.

T1  - Sexual Minority Youth Victimization and Social Support: The Intersection of Sexuality, Gender, Race, and Victimization
AN  - 1283641906; 201303265
AB  - In comparison to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are more likely to experience victimization. Multiple studies have connected anti-gay prejudice and anti-gay victimization to negative outcomes. Research shows that social support may protect sexual minorities from the harmful effects of anti-gay victimization. However, rates of victimization and the negative outcomes linked to sexual identity within the sexual minority community have been relatively unexplored. Using data from three years of statewide data from heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in grades 9-12, this study examines victimization, substance use, suicidality, and access to social support by sexuality. Results indicate that sexual minority youth are at increased risk for victimization, substance use, suicidality, and social isolation compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Results also indicate that there is very little bivariate difference within the sexual minority community. Multivariate results indicate differences among sexual minorities' experiences with victimization and substance use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - White masks/Muslim names: immigrants and name-changing in Sweden
AN  - 1010632197; 201210543
AB  - Names carry strong ethnic and religious connotations and reveal an individual's affiliation to a specific group. When a religious or ethnic group is stigmatised, the relationship between names and social stigma becomes explicit. For Muslims, names and veils are the two most conspicuous signifiers of their stigmatised identity. Some believe that covering their Muslim identity with Swedish-sounding or 'neutral' European names will facilitate their individual integration into society. Based on empirical findings, examining application forms for name-changing and interviews with name-changers, this article offers an exploratory analysis of the reasons, expectations and effects of surname-changing among immigrants with Muslim names. It examines the extent to which the changes reflect the impact of social disadvantage and anti-Muslim sentiment in Sweden.

T1  - Multiculturalism as nation-building in Australia: Inclusive national identity and the embrace of diversity
AN  - 1037879201; 201231146
AB  - This article discusses the relationship between multiculturalism and national identity, focusing on the Australian context. It argues that inclusive national identity can accommodate and support multiculturalism, and serve as an important source of cohesion and unity in ethnically and culturally diverse societies. However, a combative approach to national identity, as prevailed under the Howard government, threatens multicultural values. The article nevertheless concludes that it is necessary for supporters of multiculturalism to engage in ongoing debates about their respective national identities, rather than to vacate the field of national identity to others.

T1  - An Update and Reflections on Fear of and Discrimination Against Bisexuals, Homosexuals, and Individuals with AIDS
AN  - 1125224512; 201240532
AB  - This study explored the relationship between biphobia, homophobia, AIDS phobia, an individual's sexual opinions and the orientation of an individual's past sexual behaviors and fantasies. Participants (N = 224) completed five self-report measures designed to specifically assess these psychological constructs. There were statistically significant correlations between the participants' fear and discrimination of sexual minorities and individuals with AIDS. Additionally, the results suggest that more conservative views regarding sexuality are associated with higher levels of biphobia and homophobia. Finally, past sexual fantasies, which were more exclusively gay/lesbian in content, were associated with lower levels of erotophobia, biphobia and homophobia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Economic activity in the South-Asian population in Britain: the impact of ethnicity, religion, and class
AN  - 919903709; 201201666
AB  - This paper expands the existing literature on ethnicity and economic activity in Britain by studying the impact of religion and class. It argues that while the class location of the different South-Asian groups is important in determining their labour market outcomes, it does not operate independently from ethnicity; rather it is highly influenced by ethnicity in the process of determining the labour market participation of these groups. We use data obtained from the 2001 UK Census on Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi men and women aged between twenty and twenty nine. Our findings confirm that class structure of the South-Asian groups is highly ethnicized, in that the ethno-religious background and class are interwoven to the extent that the separation between them is not easy, if not impossible.

T1  - Why Diversity Became Orthodox in Higher Education, and How it Changed the Meaning of Race on Campus
AN  - 907928627; 201124629
AB  - Using qualitative data about University of Michigan between 1965 and 2005, this article shows how administrators' diversity discourse and programs have defined race as a cultural identity, expressed through interaction, which provides instrumental benefits. It also explains three major reasons why, starting in the mid-1980s, university administrators adopted this racial orthodoxy of "diversity": to signal compliance with-and also to redefine-law and institutional norms while still practicing race-based affirmative admissions; to frame inclusion in more complex terms than a racial binary or numerical representation amidst growing campus multiculturalism; and to market the university, especially to white students. The article advances racial formation theory by developing the concept of a racial orthodoxy. It shows that diversity discourse and programs have sometimes advanced the goal of racial minority inclusion, but at the cost of downplaying problems of racial inequality and misrepresenting racial minorities' campus experiences.

T1  - Recursive Secession of Trapped Minorities: A Comparative Study of the Serb Krajina and Abkhazia
AN  - 919904195; 201201709
AB  - Recursive secessions are attempts at secession from a seceding state (or a state emerging from a secession). This article compares attempts at recursive secession of the Serb Krajina from Croatia and of Abkhazia from Georgia and the use of force and violence in these two attempts at recursive secession. While remarkable similarities are found in the political strategies of the secessionist leaders in these two cases, there are significant differences in the use of military force both by the secessionists and their host-state authorities. The difference may be explicable by the greater dependence of the Serb Krajina secessionist leadership on the military and logistic assistance of its protector state, Serbia.

T1  - Comparisons of the success of racial minority immigrant offspring in the United States, Canada and Australia
AN  - 887494908; 201118182
AB  - The educational, occupational and income success of the racial minority immigrant offspring is very similar for many immigrant origins groups in the United States, Canada and Australia. An analysis based on merged files of Current Population Surveys for the United States for the period 1995-2007, and the 2001 Censuses of Canada and Australia, and taking account of urban areas of immigrant settlement, reveals common patterns of high achievement for the Chinese and South Asian second generation, less for other Asian origins, and still less for those of Afro-Caribbean black origins. Relatively lower entry statuses for these immigrant groups in the US are eliminated for the second generation, indicating they experience stronger upward inter-generational mobility. As well, 'segmented assimilation' suggesting downward assimilation of Afro-Caribbean immigrants into an urban underclass in the US, also receives little support. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Effects of legitimizing discrimination against homosexuals on gay bashing
AN  - 887501098; 201118006
AB  - We used a computer harassment paradigm to test the hypothesis that affirming the legitimacy of discrimination against homosexuals increases the likelihood that heterosexual men will engage in verbal gay bashing. Legitimacy of discrimination was varied among heterosexual males (N=167) by suggesting that denying homosexuals rights and benefits is either illegitimate or legitimate, and participants interacted online with either a gay or straight bogus discussion partner. Results show that (a) participants sent more offensive comments when the legitimacy of discrimination against homosexuals was affirmed and (b) legitimacy affected gay bashing through its effect on collective guilt. These findings suggest that challenging the legitimacy of discrimination can be an effective strategy for reducing outgroup derogation. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Burmese Indians in contemporary Burma: heritage, influence, and perceptions since 1988
AN  - 862595342; 201109623
AB  - This article seeks to explore the current role, significance and influence of Burmese Indian minorities in post-1988 Burma as well as the perceptions the Burmese indigenous society and elite have developed on them since the colonial era. British Burma (1826-1948) witnessed a massive immigration of Indian communities that disproportionately dominated Burma's colonial enterprise. A strong resentment thus arose among the Burman Buddhist majority, illustrated by the rise of a popular 'indophobia' phenomenon. Paroxysmal expressions of the colonial original trauma were observed through recurrent pre-independence anti-Indian riots as well as a specific and enduring linguistic patronizing classification of the 'Kalas' by the Burmese language. Nationalistic administrative laws, enacted by the Burmese post-independence parliamentarian and military governments, furthered the downgrading and discrimination of Burmese Indians who remain however a visible minority today, with a manifest economic weight and a strong socio-cultural presence throughout Burma. In this paper, it will, however, be argued that after years of 'Burmanization' processes, Burmese old-age 'indophobic' sentiments have turned towards more 'islamophobic' tendencies, now explicitly targeting the Muslim communities of Indian origin, but that it remains difficult to evaluate their impact on Burma's current policymaking.

T1  - The Impact of Group Entitativity on Linguistic Discrimination: Ingroup Favoritism and Outgroup Derogation in the Explanation of Negative Outcome Allocations
AN  - 964196716; 201207271
AB  - This study investigated the impact of minimal group entitativity on linguistic ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. Group entitativity varied across three conditions: mere categorization, spatial separation of groups, and common fate. Participants described with spontaneous language negative outcome allocations performed either by ingroup or by outgroup members. Findings showed that linguistic discrimination was not elicited by mere categorization and occurred only in the common fate condition. Group entitativity mainly affected linguistic outgroup derogation. This study adds to the evidence of linguistic discrimination in minimal groups and shows the strength of a linguistic measure in disentangling the different components of intergroup bias.

AN  - 896195947; 201120179
AB  - An analysis of non-governmental organisation (NGO) participation and interventions in the United Nations Working Group on Minorities (WGM) shows that the WGM neither enhanced a framing of minorities' issues so as to present them to a wider public and link-up with other (civil society) actors nor did it act as a catalyst for an international minority advocacy movement, however, by providing an institutionalised space, it allowed for the articulation of a discourse and facilitated dialogue between NGOs and governments.

T1  - Two Campaigns to Strengthen United Nations Mechanisms on Minority Rights
AN  - 896165429; 201120123
AB  - Over the last decade, the non-governmental organisation Minority Rights Group International ran two campaigns at the United Nations. The first sought to create a new special procedure of the Commission on Human Rights -- a position of an expert with a mandate to investigate and make recommendations to remedy specific situations of violations of minority rights. The second responded to a situation in which the UN's only forum for representatives of minorities was threatened with closure, and aimed to keep it or have it replaced with a more effective body. In this article, the authors -- who were both involved in these campaigns -- will try to identify some lessons learnt from the strategies used, and draw some conclusions about the role of an international nongovernmental organisation in strengthening the international minority rights regime, and how, in so doing, it links with minority communities around the world.

T1  - Language Rights in Relations with Public Administration: European Perspectives
AN  - 870433164; 201114320
AB  - The preservation of linguistic diversity has recently become a major concern to many researchers, politicians and leaders of linguistic communities in Europe. The issue of linguistic minorities has taken on a particular urgency because of the increasing recognition of the threat of extinction faced by many minority languages. The need for immediate action has become obvious. Europe has slowly but steadily started to come up with responses to how to keep the most vulnerable languages from extinction and guarantee rights to speakers of such languages at the same time. Today we can talk about the emergence of a European minimum standard of protection of language rights as it has developed since the 1990s in the European conventions and their monitoring activities. There is general understanding that three areas of the use of languages -- education, administrative affairs and the media -- are determinant for the survival of minority languages. The present article focuses on one of such areas, which has revealed to be particularly contentious and a source of ever-increasing concern. It investigates the guarantees provided in the Council of Europe's instruments pertaining to the use of minority languages before public authorities, the practical difficulties and ways of their overcoming in the implementation of the rights enshrined in European treaties.

T1  - From Diaspora to Diaspora: The Case of Transylvanian Saxons in Romania and Germany
AN  - 870432575; 201114283
AB  - This article investigates the relationship between Transylvanian Saxons (Siebenburger Sachsen) and their perceived "external homeland." The authors consider the history of German minorities in East-Central Europe and, more specifically, briefly outline the history of Transylvanian Saxons. Against this backdrop, this article examines the changing nature of minority policies promoted by the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) until the present day, whilst juxtaposing this with Transylvanian Saxon discourses on identity and nationhood. In so doing, this article argues that the discrepancy between the mutual expectations of the FRG and Transylvanian Saxon emigres became very pronounced after 1989. This then has led to what appears to be the end of the Saxon community, as emigres have found themselves torn between assimilation and a longing for a return to Transylvania.

T1  - A comparison of minimal group induction procedures: GPIR
AN  - 1928215459
AB  - For 40 years researchers have studied minimal groups using a variety of induction procedures which, surprisingly, have never been formally evaluated. This article reports two experiments that compared minimal group induction procedures based on: (1) memorization of novel ingroup names; (2) an imagination instruction; (3) random assignment; and (4) false feedback from painting preferences. The memorization procedure produced the largest ingroup favoritism effects on implicit measures of attraction and identification, whereas all procedures produced comparable ingroup favoritism effects on explicit measures of attraction and identification and bonus money allocation. The memorization procedure is recommended as a practical and effective minimal group induction procedure, particularly in cases in which implicit assessments are of primary interest.

T1  - Acquisition of Cross-Ethnic Friends by Recent Immigrants in Canada: A Longitudinal Approach
AN  - 1221407566; 201244098
AB  - This paper examines the development of inter-ethnic friendships between immigrants and Canadians. It uses longitudinal data from three waves of the Canadian LSIC survey, in which newly arrived immigrants were followed during the first 4 years of settlement. It is found that pre-migration characteristics play an important role in the development of inter-ethnic friendships: immigrants who arrive at a younger age and for economic reasons, as well as those who are highly educated and have a cross-ethnic partner at the moment of arrival, establish more inter-ethnic friendships over time. In addition, post-migration characteristics affect the formation of inter-ethnic friendships. Such friendships are more common among immigrants who embrace Canadian traditions and acquire the host-country language, as well as among those who work in international settings and inhabit ethnically mixed neighborhoods. The effects of pre-migration characteristics are partially mediated by post-migration characteristics. Our findings point out that economic, cultural, and spatial integration are all conducive to inter-ethnic friendships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond Territory: Revisiting the Normative Justification of Self-Government in Theory and Practice
AN  - 1081864626; 201235222
AB  - The association of sovereignty with control over territory is being challenged both internally and externally in modern societies. Demands for political autonomy from sub-state minorities undermine the natural link between nation, state and territory from within, while the movement of capital, goods and information across borders contests the relationship between these concepts from without. Scholars of international relations, law, philosophy and political science have already suggested that the sovereignty of nation-states is under attack; however, scant attention has been paid to the way in which changes in the relation between nation, state, and territory affect the normative weight associated with each of these concepts in discussions about sovereignty and self-government. The objectives of this article is to examine the way in which nation, state, sovereignty, and territory are addressed in normative justifications of indigenous self-government and to better understand how these notions are being treated in its implementation.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 856403162; 201106822
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The impact of exchange programs on the integration of the hostgroup into the self-concept
AN  - 60353451; 201017323
AB  - Two studies analyzed the impact of international exchange programs on students' identity development. More precisely, the authors predict that exchange students integrate the host society (hostgroup) into their self-concept during an exchange year. Study 1 found a stronger social identification with the hostgroup and higher commitment for former exchange students than for future exchange students. Study 2 replicated the difference between former and future exchange students and found in addition that both former and future exchange students had a stronger identification and commitment in comparison to a control group that did neither take part in nor apply for an exchange program. Moreover, in this study the inclusion of the hostgroup into the self-concept was assessed via a response time paradigm. The results indicate that former and future exchange students have a stronger association between the self and the hostgroup than the control sample, but no difference between former and future exchange students was found. The results provide evidence for the impact of interest in and actual intensive intergroup contact on students' self-concept. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]
