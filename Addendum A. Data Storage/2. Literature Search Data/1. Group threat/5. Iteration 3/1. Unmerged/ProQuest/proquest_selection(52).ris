T1  - An aversive racism explanation for the influence of race, SES, and race-stereotypical crimes on jury decision biases against East Asian American defendants
AN  - 2661755855
AB  - Aversive racism, a subtle form of contemporary racism for persons who may hold egalitarian values, has been used to explain prejudice by jurors toward Black American and Latinx American defendants, but has yet to examine East Asian American defendants as targets of prejudice. After conducting a pilot study to find race-stereotypical crimes for Asian Americans and White Americans, the purpose of the main study was to examine mock jurors’ prejudice toward East Asian American defendants from an aversive racism perspective. A 2 (Race: White American or East Asian American) x 2 (SES: low or high) x 2 (Race-Stereotypical Crime: embezzlement or computer hacking) between-subjects design was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to read one of eight trial vignettes describing the crime the defendant had allegedly committed. They were then asked to render a verdict, recommend a sentence, and rate the defendant on various culpability and trait measures. Results showed mock jurors sentenced the low SES East Asian American defendant who committed a race-stereotypical crime more punitively than all other conditions. Mock jurors also found this defendant more culpable and rated him more negatively on a number of trait ascriptions. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Problematising mainstream Spanish antiracism: race, racism and whiteness
AN  - 2631378504
AB  - In Spain, (anti-)racism is of scarce relevance to public debates and, when the topic is broached, it has mainly been discussed in relation to non-EU migration. Besides, its historical link with colonialism generally remains unacknowledged. This article analyses the problematisation of ‘race’ and ‘racism’ in this context, as performed by hegemonic stakeholders (i.e. public servants, NGOs, experts) in the fields of anti-discrimination, Roma inclusion and immigrant integration policies. As the fieldwork materials illustrate, this understanding rejects ‘race’ not only from a scientific-biological perspective but also as a social-political category. Accordingly, racism is depoliticised and theorised in a twofold manner: (1) as a matter of stereotypes, prejudices and lack of information about the ‘Other’; (2) as the aggressive acts of explicitly racist individuals/organisations. The structural, historical and institutional dimensions of racism are addressed either as background context, or they are negated by public policies. By not confronting the uneven power relations (re)produced by racism, this approach reaffirms ‘institutional whiteness’ as the underlying perspective of mainstream Spanish anti-racism.

T1  - The politics of identity: The unexpected role of political orientation on racial categorizations of Kamala Harris
AN  - 2614034742
AB  - The 2020 US Presidential election was historic in that it featured the first woman of color, Kamala Harris, on a major‐party ticket. Although Harris identifies as Black, her racial identity was widely scrutinized throughout the election, due to her mixed‐race ancestry. Moreover, media coverage of Harris's racial identity appeared to vary based on that news outlet's political leaning and sometimes had prejudicial undertones. The current research investigated racial categorization of Harris and the role that political orientation and anti‐Black prejudice might play in shaping these categorizations. Studies 1 and 2 tested the possibility that conservatives and liberals might mentally represent Harris differently, which we hypothesized would lead the two groups to differ in how they categorized her race. Contrary to our prediction, conservatives, and liberals mentally represented Harris similarly. Also surprising were the explicit racial categorization data. Conservatives labeled Harris as White more than liberals, who tended to categorize Harris as multiracial. This pattern was explained by anti‐Black prejudice. Study 3 examined a potential political motivation that might explain this finding. We found that conservatives, more than liberals, judge having a non‐White candidate on a Democratic ballot as an asset, which may lead conservatives to deny non‐White candidates these identities.

T1  - Profiling racial prejudice during COVID‐19: Who exhibits anti‐Asian sentiment in Australia and the United States?
AN  - 2605007301
AB  - Following the COVID‐19 outbreak, anti‐Asian racism increased around the world, as exhibited through greater instances of abuse and hate crimes. To better understand the scale of anti‐Asian racism and the characteristics of people who may be expressing racial prejudice, we sampled respondents in Australia and the United States over 31 August–9 September 2020 (1375 Australians and 1060 Americans aged 18 or above; source YouGov). To address potential social desirability bias, we use both direct and indirect (list experiment) questions to measure anti‐Asian sentiment and link these variables to key socioeconomic factors. We find that, instead of being universal among general populations, anti‐Asian sentiment is patterned differently across both country contexts and socioeconomic groups. In the United States, the most significant predictor of anti‐Asian bias is political affiliation. By contrast, in Australia, anti‐Asian bias is closely linked to a wide range of socioeconomic factors including political affiliation, age, gender, employment status and income.

T1  - ‘Kouri, kouri! Bis la ap vini!’: Reflections on the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school in the Bahamas
AN  - 2582376200
AB  - There is a pervasive stigma attached to being Haitian in the Bahamas. This article examines reflections on the experiences of the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school among second-generation Haitians in the Bahamas. Based on this research, I argue that primary school functions as the first major institution where children of Haitian descent experience stigma as it relates to their ethnic heritage and, in turn, are exposed to the idea of being the ‘other’ in Bahamian society through bullying and anti-Haitian sentiments from students and teachers. Stigma, prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination characterize primary and secondary education for Haitians living in the Bahamas and are manifest in the form of cruel teasing, bullying, and discrimination primarily from students and teachers. The goal is not to argue that children of Haitian descent are completely unaware of anti-Haitian sentiment in the Bahamas until they attend school but, rather, that school functions as one of the first institutions children of Haitian descent learn there is stigma in being Haitian in the Bahamas.

T1  - Dual identity, conflict, and education: an exploration of the lived experience of social relationships of young British Muslim women who attend British universities
AN  - 2509111687
AB  - Previous research concerned with British Muslim women has explored a range of important issues. However, what is missing is research exploring the lived everyday social experiences, including the unique nature of identity formation in British Muslims. This qualitative study tried to address this gap. Five female British Muslims were interviewed, and their interviews analysed using an interpretative phenomenological approach. Three key themes emerged from the data: Constructing identity, Experiencing prejudice in interactions, and Educating oneself and others. The findings demonstrate the complex nature of being a British Muslim woman, the impact of discrimination from various sources and the gendered nature of these experiences. It also highlights the active nature of identity formation, which occurs within and relates to a particular setting and particular experiences. Implications and future research are discussed.

T1  - The complex relationship between colorism and poor health outcomes with African Americans: A systematic review
AN  - 2472327744
AB  - Colorism has a deleterious effect on cognition and health impacting populations. Among African Americans, colorism and social stratification based on skin complexion, has profound sociological effects. These social relationships in daily living show the health burden associated with colorism is enormous. Dark‐skinned African Americans have lower socioeconomic status, diminished prestige, and are less likely to hold elected offices compared to their lighter skin counterparts. This systematic review critically examines a wider scope of effects colorism has on African American adults, a topic not well understood and underexplored. To what extent does colorism impact the psychosocial, educational, and economic outcomes of African Americans? What is the evidence for the efficacy of colorism research associated with poor health? PRISMA guidelines, which consisted of a 27‐item checklist and a four‐phase flow diagram, were used to evaluate research studies. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify and summarize qualitative and quantitative studies. The findings illustrate that African Americans with darker skin are significantly impacted by prejudice solely because of the color of their skin. The multidimensionality of colorism within society for African Americans delineates further damaging impacts on human health. Implications for social and policy changes are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice against members of a ridiculed working‐class group
AN  - 2448123252
AB  - In five experiments, we examined the stereotypes, emotions, and behavioural intentions associated with a Spanish working‐class group, known as chonis. We described a student (Experiments 1–3) or job candidate (Experiments 4–5) and presented participants with a picture showing a woman characterized either as choni or posh (an upper‐class group, Experiments 2–4) or with no picture (Experiments 1, 3–5). Depending on the condition, explicit information about her high social class (Experiment 1), performance (Experiment 3), or category (Experiment 5) was provided. Participants evaluated the candidate more negatively, felt less admiration, and were less willing to interact with her or to recommend her for a job when she was categorized as choni as compared to the other categories. These effects disappeared if the student/candidate had high socioeconomic status or performed excellently in the academic domain, but they were magnified for highly (vs. weakly) materialistic individuals. Class prejudice apparently has harmful effects on disadvantaged individuals, but can be mitigated by explicit information.

T1  - Mobility, familiarity and prejudice: living together in a multiethnic town in southern Laos
AN  - 2417139182
AB  - Research on coexistence and urban diversity (notably in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore) has demonstrated the ways individuals of diverse backgrounds routinely manage differences and interact meaningfully in multicultural societies, drawing on shared cultural knowledge and habits. This paper argues for a deeper exploration of societies where intercultural know-how is more limited and the capacity to negotiate difference has not been inculcated. This description fits several Southeast Asian societies wherein the politics of majority-minority is a dominant feature. This article investigates the possibilities of familiarity and friendship in a multiethnic town in southern Laos where the predominant ideology towards cultural diversity has been one of assimilation. In doing so, the paper reveals ways of creating a sense of belonging and community other than the practices of cultural accommodation. These processes draw on competences and dispositions which individuals have acquired through their mobility, producing a sense of togetherness, albeit contingent and fragmented.

T1  - Catholic racism and anti-Jewish discourse in interwar Austria and Slovakia: the cases of Anton Orel and Karol Körper
AN  - 2444579571
AB  - Szabó’s study deals with the phenomenon of so-called Catholic racism, that is, the penetration of racist argumentation into anti-Jewish polemics within European Catholicism, in the first half of the twentieth century. It presents the ideas of two Catholic intellectuals—Anton Orel from Austria and Karol Körper from Slovakia—to demonstrate that, while this process unfolded against the background of the rising Nazi movement in Germany, it was specific to the different national contexts of Central Europe. While in Germany several Catholic commentators and theologians sought to reconcile Catholic doctrine with notions of racial supremacy, in other countries they responded differently to such tendencies. The Austrian writer Anton Orel, for example, highlighted the supranational identity of a ‘Great Austria’ (Grossösterreich) based on Catholicism and corporatism, as opposed to German national and Protestant racism, whereas his Slovak colleague Körper surprisingly drew inspiration from the white supremacist ideology of North America. Apart from the different national contexts, Szabó’s study also describes the transnational character of Catholic racism. In modern Catholic antisemitism Jews are stereotyped not only based on religious differences but, in the light of conspiracy theories, they are also presented as an embodiment of modernization, a socio-economic and political ‘threat’. Another specific feature of Catholic racism is the fact that it did not primarily defer to the authority of natural science, which had challenged its earlier monopoly on the interpretation of the world and man’s place in it. Instead, its supporters gave a political character to the traditional doctrine of substitution theology, so-called supersessionism, based on which Christians claimed to assume the role of the Jews as the chosen people. Correspondingly, the chosenness of the Jewish people is negatively connoted as a conspiracy of the ‘Jewish race’ against the Catholic religion and traditional states as well as new Christian-corporative nations, which Jews had allegedly sought to subdue in their conquest for world domination by means of capitalism or Bolshevism. Catholic racism is thus set in the wider context of the development of modern antisemitism towards its most radical Nazi form. Not even the Nazis were able to define their anti-Jewish bias scientifically, and they were therefore dependent on religious cultural models.

T1  - Australian Whiteness and Refugee Politics
AN  - 2392855501
AB  - This paper offers the historical context and a conceptual framework to understand how race has shaped Australia's identity, border and asylum politics. It examines how socially constructed whiteness has fostered a perceived need to exert strict and often violent control over the movement of people of colour in and around Australia. We outline the colonial foundations of Australian whiteness and how it has fostered anxiety and bigotry at Federation and during the First World War, in contemporary multicultural and Indigenous policies, and on sporting fields. Whiteness operates along horizontal axes that promote racist insecurities and vertical axes that promote racist hierarchies. An imperative for spatial and racial mastery also underpins the twenty‐first century militarization of Australia's migration policy, as exemplified in deterrence measures such as mandatory detention, excision, interdiction and offshore processing and resettlement. Moreover, this whiteness is present in paternalistic claims that border policies are motivated by a compulsion to save lives at sea. Understanding the distinctively anxious and punitive character of Australian refugee politics requires coming to terms with Australia's history of white authority and committing to displacing it from the prominent place that it holds in the national identity.

T1  - Want to Improve Math Scores? An Empirical Assessment of Recent Policy Interventions in Canada
AN  - 2388009411
AB  - The Canadian provinces have implemented various strategies aimed at improving kindergarten through 12th-grade mathematics performance. There is no clear evidence which, if any, of these strategies improve achievement scores. We apply hierarchical linear modelling to the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment data to isolate the effects of policy interventions. We find that efforts to improve learning conditions can be worthwhile, but their effects are not as substantial as a school's socio-economic status composition, which elevates or depresses the academic achievements of all students. As barriers to school choice come down, ambitious parents will resort to active school choice, a strategy that may reduce social equity.Alternate abstract:Les provinces canadiennes ont instauré diverses stratégies visant à améliorer la performance en mathématiques des élèves de la maternelle à la 12e année. Rien ne démontre toutefois clairement lesquelles de ces stratégies, le cas échéant, augmentent bel et bien les taux de succès. Les auteurs appliquent la modélisation linéaire hiérarchique aux données de 2012 du Programme international pour le suivi des acquis des élèves, afin d'isoler l'incidence des interventions politiques. Ils constatent que les efforts visant l'amélioration des conditions d'apprentissage peuvent être utiles mais que leurs retombées ne sont pas aussi importantes que celles de la composition socio-économique de la clientèle scolaire, qui augmente ou diminue les résultats scolaires de tous les élèves. Avec la levée des obstacles au choix d'école, les parents ambitieux se prévaudront de ce choix, une stratégie qui pourrait être préjudiciable à l'équité sociale.

T1  - Beyond Islamophobia? The role of Englishness and English national identity within English Defence League discourse and politics
AN  - 2299329690
AB  - Unsurprisingly, most scholarship on the English Defence League (EDL) focuses on the Islamophobic nature of the group's politics. This has found that, whilst the group presents a more moderate, public-facing image, the EDL's backstage discourse is a far less nuanced brand of Islamophobia and cultural racism (Allen, C. (2011). Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League. Patterns of Prejudice, 45(4), 279-294; Kassimeris, G., & Jackson, L. (2015). The ideology and discourse of the English Defence League: 'Not racist, not violent, just no longer silent'. British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 17, 171-188). A more fundamental area of EDL ideology has been left unexamined, however: what notion of 'England' is the EDL trying to 'defend'? Using content analysis of EDL online discourse, this article examines how the EDL articulates, represents, and uses English national identity within its discourse and politics.

T1  - Catholic heritage, ethno-racial self-identification, and prejudice against Haitians in the Dominican Republic
AN  - 2264601271
AB  - Latin American cultures are significantly influenced by Catholicism, which partially but meaningfully represents the European legacy that situates Latin American societies into the Western world. This influence may be particularly relevant in the Dominican Republic, where local discourses have underlined the role of Catholicism as an essential characteristic of the Dominican identity. In this study, I use nationally- and regionally-representative survey data to examine whether Catholic self-identification is directly associated with self-identifications that downplay individuals' own Afro characteristics, and whether individuals who self-identify as Catholic are significantly prejudiced against Haitians. I find regional-level evidence of direct associations between Catholic self-identification and self-identifications that downplay Afro characteristics. I also find national- and regional-level evidence of direct associations between Catholic self-identification and different indicators of prejudice against Haitians. These findings reveal the prevailing influence of Catholicism on ethno-racial self-identification and anti-Haitian sentiment in the Dominican Republic.

T1  - “I Understand What They’re Going through”: How Socioeconomic Background Shapes the Student Service-learning Experience
AN  - 2248278983
AB  - Traditional service-learning pedagogy assumes that learning occurs when contact between relatively advantaged students and a relatively disadvantaged service population reduces prejudice. However, little is known about how students whose backgrounds are similar to the populations they serve process this learning experience. This study explores the connections between socioeconomic status and learning trajectories within service-learning. Students provided written reflections on a service-learning experience focused on food insecurity as part of course requirements. Analysis reveals that students with low socioeconomic status (SES) demonstrate different learning processes than medium- and high-SES students. Namely, low-SES students were less likely than high-SES students to hold prejudiced attitudes prior to service, and low-SES students emphasized a systemic understanding of food insecurity and poverty, while medium- and high-SES students were much more likely to emphasize an individualist understanding. We discuss the implications of these findings for future research to improve service-learning pedagogy for students of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

T1  - Embodying 'the Nordic race': imaginaries of Viking heritage in the online communications of the Nordic Resistance Movement
AN  - 2238516152
AB  - Kølvraa's article focuses on the cultural imaginary of the Scandinavian extreme right by analysing the online presence of the so-called Nordic Resistance Movement. He seeks to show how the cultural imaginaries of this National Socialist organization make use of the Scandinavian Viking heritage in three distinct ways. First, to produce a distinctly Nordic form of National Socialism and thus potentially make this ideology palatable to Nordic publics. Second, to differentiate their racially oriented political project from a wider far-right or populist right concern with the defence of European Christian heritage and/or civilization against Islam. And, third, to thematize and perform a certain hyper-masculine identity, especially in the context of martial and sporting competitions arranged by the organization.

AN  - 2226215615
AB  - This research article critically analyses the photographs and illustrations that have been used to support arguments about Omar Khadr. Khadr was a 15-year-old who was captured by the US in Afghanistan, transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he was charged with murder and submitted to US interrogation. Throughout this process both supporters and opponents of Khadr have used pictures to support their claims. By examining and discussing these images it is possible to detect biases and prejudices that attempt to sway and influence the reader to the particular ideology of the writers. The article studies in depth images both for, and against, Khadr. It shows the different, printing and illustrating techniques that add menace to existing photographs, or soften the image for a more peaceful approach. In particular, it subjects the image of Khadr's damaged body being assisted by soldiers to a critical analysis to reveal what it really shows.

T1  - Structural racism as the fundamental cause of the academic achievement gap
AN  - 2235410844
AB  - Over six decades since the Supreme Court ruled that all American children have the right to a high quality education, the academic achievement gap remains an important social problem in the United States. Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.

T1  - Facets of nativism: a heuristic exploration
AN  - 2209972966
AB  - Contemporary radical right-wing populism is an ideational compound of anti-elite populism and nativism, the latter encapsulated in the notion that 'the own people' should come first. Like populism, nativism has proven to be a rather elusive concept, particularly when it comes to its relationship to related concepts, such as patriotism, nationalism and particularly racism. Originally developed to analyse anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States and Canada, the term 'nativism' has recently been increasingly used to understand the success of the radical populist right in Europe and elsewhere. In this article, Betz present three facets of nativism: economic nativism, centred on the notion that jobs should be reserved for native citizens; welfare chauvinism, based on the notion that native citizens should be accorded absolute priority when it comes to social benefits; and symbolic nativism, advancing the notion that government should do everything to defend the cultural identity of a given national society. Whereas, in the past, economic considerations, including concerns about the viability of the welfare state, were central to anti-immigrant sentiment, in recent years, symbolic nativism, grounded in a defence of national cultural identity, is central to the success of radical right-wing populist mobilization.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: opposing constructions of mixed race in Australia
AN  - 2198982822
AB  - In the Australian context, the development of a 'situated politics of mixedness' is complicated by the fact that there are (at least) two main categories of mixed race populations - the Indigenous and the migrant/settler. For those with mixed Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal ancestries, and those with mixed White and other migrant ancestries, life chances and identities differ significantly. This paper outlines some of these differences using the trope of pride and prejudice. For those of mixed migrant/settler heritage, evidence is growing that the mixed experience is predominantly one of pride. For them, misrecognition, or being asked about their racial background, is an opportunity for play, often resulting in 'the big reveal' of a valorised mixed identity associated with something other than a bland 'white bread' Australian-ness. For those of mixed Indigenous heritage however, there remains a significant level of prejudice, not (only) for being Aboriginal, but for not being visibly Aboriginal enough. Using existing studies and a number of media controversies as examples, this paper interrogates the implications of these differences for understandings of the ways in which race is recruited in the construction of legitimate identity claims. It asks particularly how 'mixed race' is helpful analytically to describe the identity constructions within these two very different experiences.

T1  - Elogio del "apalencamiento": Perspectivas ante la pervivencia y reproducción de la desigualdad, los prejuicios y la discriminación raciales en la sociedad cubana actual
AN  - 2250327375
AB  - Este ensayo reflexiona sobre la pervivencia del racismo y los prejuicios raciales en Cuba. Como factor determinante de esta situación, la autora examina la hegemonía del eurocentrismo, que conlleva a la estereotipada percepción, compartida por la mayoría de los cubanos de todas las razas, de lo negro como algo externo a una supuestamente auténtica identidad nacional. El artículo demuestra la necesidad de desconstruir la cosmovisión eurocéntrica que ha siempre determinado el imaginario nacional, de desarrollar nuevas maneras de representación de lo negro y utilizar otras formas del conocimiento. Desde una perspectiva epistemológica, cimarronaje y apalencamiento son analizados como dos de estas estrategias contrahegemónicas.
This essay explains the persistence of racism in Cuba. Identifying the hegemony of Eurocentrism as determinant in the permanence of racial prejudice, it illustrates how pervasive Western centric worldviews lead to the stereotyped perception, shared by most Cubans of all races, of the black as something external to a supposedly authentic national identity. The article argues for the deconstruction of the Eurocentric gaze that has always determined the national imaginary, the development of other ways of representing blackness, and the use of other forms of knowledge. Cimarronaje y apalencamiento are here stressed as two relevant counterhegemonic strategies.

T1  - Factors Associated with North Korean Refugees’ Intention to Resettle Permanently in South Korea
AN  - 2153516019
AB  - Issues for North Korean refugee integration and resettlement have, in recent times, been a subject of great attention in South Korea. Previous studies documented that North Korean refugees faced significant obstacles in resettlement because of maladjustment and marginalisation, socioeconomic status differences between the North and the South, prejudice, suspicion, national identity, and strong nationalism. This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors that impede or facilitate the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea using a holistic approach (i.e. market and means, social connections, facilitators, and foundations). To this end, we analysed a sample of 405 North Korean refugees. Univariate comparison of descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were performed. Factors such as foundations (i.e. citizenship and other rights) were found to have strong positive associations with successful resettlement after controlling for sociodemographics and other characteristics. The study concludes that citizenship and rights need to be considered for the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea.

T1  - An Exploration of Femininity, Masculinity, and Racial Prejudices in <i>Herland</i>
AN  - 2136818807
AB  - Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935) helped spearhead the fin de siècle and early 20th‐century women’s rights movement and significantly contributed to the feminist literary genre with The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). Despite her dedication to the women’s movement and contributions to feminist literature, her novel Herland (1915) features problematic undertones of racism, elitism, and masculine degradation. Within recent years, feminism has become a term that is synonymous with inclusivity, with a focus on intersectionality and the rights of not only women but others who have been disenfranchised by race, religious affiliation, sexuality, socioeconomic status, or gender identification. Given modern feminism’s focus on diversity, the racist undertones and focus on gender separatism in Herland places Gilman outside the feminist literary genre, particularly as it has been defined in recent decades.

T1  - Nation, national remembrance, and education - Polish schools as factories of nationalism and prejudice
AN  - 2122689216
AB  - This article describes and attempts to explain the reasons for the conservative and nationalist character of Polish schools. The author uses data from surveys, analyzes political programs, postulates concerning education put forward by conservatives, and quotes poems emphasizing national identity from textbooks used at schools to teach reading skills. According to the author, it can be observed that nationalists build an atmosphere of aversion to immigrants, which affects racism in the school hallways. The article also presents the phenomenon of so-called school chambers of national remembrance, which are part of patriotic rituals practiced by Polish society. The author emphasizes that nationalism is the basis for changes in history programs of study, which are part of the educational reform implemented by the Law and Justice (Prawo i Sprawiedliwosc - PiS) government. The cultural soft power, which is used to make reality more "national," complements the administrative and political hard power of the PiS party - both tools are used to create an authoritarian-nationalist vision of social order.

T1  - 'They treat us like criminals': urban public spaces and ethnic discrimination in Italy
AN  - 2081349322
AB  - Mantovan's article analyses the processes that lead to discrimination against migrants in the public spaces of Italy's towns. Her analysis is based on a three-year research project conducted in northeastern Italy using mixed methods-ethnographic observation, semi-structured interviews, a press review, an analysis of relevant documentation and data collection-and remaining constantly in touch with research conducted in various Italian cities. Starting from an idea of a city whose evolution is the product of alliances, conflicts, active networks of individuals and their respective competing interests, Mantovan sheds light on how discrimination against immigrants in Italy's urban public spaces is the result of a process of social construction implemented by a number of social actors (journalists, citizens' committees, politicians and police forces) who represent the visible presence of migrants in these public spaces as deviant and unlawful, especially if they are undocumented immigrants and/or of low socio-economic status. She also argues for the importance of taking into consideration the contribution of economic and political dynamics, both global and national, to the generation of these phenomena by interacting with those at the local level.

T1  - Liberalism and the anxiety of belief
AN  - 2081347983
AB  - Anxiety about perceived threats to liberal freedom has played a double role in liberalism. On the one hand, such anxiety has driven the development of liberal institutions aimed at safeguarding freedoms. Yet another, problematic, side of this anxiety can also be found in the history of liberalism and in the policies and practices of contemporary liberal states. From the beginning, liberal intolerance of those perceived to be connected, through religious affiliation or beliefs, with arbitrary or absolute power and therefore deemed to pose a threat to the existing order has justified social exclusion and, in many cases, systematic violence. Rae's article examines the theoretical and political roots of this distinctive form of liberal anxiety, tracing the connection between anxiety about Catholicism and Catholics in John Locke's time and contemporary anxieties about the relationship between Islamism and Muslims in liberal states.

Historians have long neglected to include refugees in their general national, regional or world histories. There is a large historiography on refugees in specific situations—for example, of Jewish displaced persons after the Holocaust or Hindu and Muslim refugees in the wake of Partition—and a growing body of literature dealing with the creation of refugees through forced removal, especially where this phenomenon slides into ethnic cleansing and the concerns of genocide studies. This is also increasingly the case with respect to international organizations, especially with respect to their attempts to coordinate aid to refugees and to codify international law on the rights of refugees. Finally, there is now an emerging field of refugee history—focusing on the experience of different groups of refugees over time, their constitution as refugees by persecuting states and movements, their experience of migration (though such studies remain limited), and the response of receiving states, including individuals, charities and aid organizations—that increasingly seeks to represent the refugees’ experience rather than simply seeing them as passive objects of persecution and recipients of rescue. Nevertheless, it remains the case that, despite Philip Marfleet’s decade-old call to study history, refugee studies is dominated by sociology, anthropology, political theory and law. In other words, it is very much focused on present-day concerns, especially questions of security and border control, citizenship and statelessness, national identity, the politics of immigration, people trafficking, human rights, international law, the ethics of asylum, and the role of NGOs and international organizations such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in aiding refugees, creating and maintaining camps, and resettling refugees.

T1  - After Charlie: the unravelling of the French republican response
AN  - 1992735530
AB  - Starting with the assault on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on 7 January 2015, the French Republic has endured a series of terrorist attacks, culminating in the massacre of civilians on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice on 14 July 2016, an outrage deliberately and symbolically timed to coincide with the Bastille Day celebration. During this period, the governing and other elites in France attempted to foster a sense of national unity around key republican values as the most effective response to the threat posed by terrorism. After examining the inconsistent postures struck by the French socialist government in the months following the outrages of 2015 and 2016, Raymond's article will analyse the contradictions of the previous administration in order to illustrate the argument that the problematic relationship between race, identity and secularism cuts across the traditional ideological cleavages of left and right. The failure of leading mainstream political figures to articulate an effective and unifying discourse in the face of the terrorist threat to France is not, however, purely a failure of communication. Raymond will address the adequacy of a blueprint for social cohesion shaped by the Third Republic and exemplified by the formal separation of church and state in 1905. He considers whether the traditional understanding of what it means to belong to the 'one and indivisible' republic has problematized the sense of national self-esteem and contributed to the current tension in France.

T1  - Does Asserting a Nonblack Identity Elicit Positive Evaluations? White Observers' Reactions to Black, Biracial, Multiracial, and White Job Applicants
AN  - 1986849627
AB  - How do white observers react when people with black heritage assert a biracial, multiracial, or white identity rather than a black identity? To address this question, I conducted two experiments in which participants evaluated a darker-skinned or a lighter-skinned job applicant who presented his identity as either black, biracial, multiracial, or white. The results show that identity assertions influenced how white observers categorized applicants but not how they evaluated applicants. Most white observers accepted the identity of both the lighter-skinned and darker-skinned applicant when they asserted that they were black, biracial, or multiracial, but observers did not accept the identity of the darker-skinned applicant who asserted a white identity. However, white observers did not perceive applicants who asserted that they were multiracial, biracial, or white as more hirable than applicants who asserted that they were black. Based on these results, I argue that racial identity assertions do not independently provide a pathway to racialized advantages.

T1  - ‘I didn't mean that: It was just a slip of the tongue’: Racial slips and gaffes in the public arena
AN  - 2008937436
AB  - Speech errors, slips, and gaffes made in the public arena that are perceived to be either implicitly or explicitly racially offensive often result in significant social consequences to the responsible speaker and generate public controversy. The current research, informed by conversation analysis and discursive psychology, examines how speakers manage such troubles‐in‐speaking in public settings. The sample of naturalistic data includes five such instances and related apologies sourced from YouTube and news websites. The analysis examined how speakers initiated repairs when making offensive racial slips and gaffes and followed these up with apologies. Self‐detected transgressions were repaired in fewer turns than other‐detected blunders. Speakers accounted for their transgressions as innocent mishaps (e.g., ‘it was just a slip of the tongue’, ‘an honest mistake’) to fend off attributions of prejudice or a racist identity. Thus, a common resource that speakers drew upon to exonerate themselves was that what they said, did not align with their psychological intentions. Intention then was a notable psychological resource for denying and fending off attributions of prejudice. Follow‐up apologies were related organizationally and worked to either address or decrease the likelihood of dispreferred responses from the public/audience. These apologies included the use of affect, graduation, amplification, and judgements of capacity. Although this research does not address the possible psychological nature of racial slips and gaffes – the question of what they really mean – their occurrence in everyday life and institutional settings suggest that their repressive qualities reflect shared patterns of understanding in societies structured by racial inequality.

T1  - The blind spots of liberal citizenship and integration policy
AN  - 1973044763
AB  - Governments across Europe have stepped up their efforts to manage social diversity politically, often specifically targeting Muslim populations. Lewicki interrogates the policy tools that the British and German governments deploy to 'integrate' an increasingly stigmatized and racialized population, zooming in on whether and how they problematize patterns of inequality. Complicating the 'one country, one citizenship' rationale of the citizenship regime literature that assumes a one-dimensional interpretation of history, cultural identity, political institutions or legal norms, she points to four salient liberal citizenship discourses that currently frame policies of diversity management. These are civic republicanism, multiculturalism, civic universalism and cosmopolitanism. Her analysis demonstrates that all four liberal citizenship discourses have blind spots when it comes to problematizing structural hierarchies and the logics of racism. Over the last two decades, liberal citizenship and integration policy frameworks have thus contributed to the retention of binary distinctions between superior citizens and inferior Others, distinctions that can now easily be exacerbated and used for mobilization by right-wing populist movements.

T1  - An Analysis of Skinhead Websites and Social Networks, A Decade Later
AN  - 2034196481
AB  - The present research examined five Skinhead identities (Traditional, Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (S.H.A.R.P.), Racist/Nationalist, Gay, and Other) and cultures as presented on the web and on social networks. On the web, Traditional Skinheads followed by Gay Skinheads and Racist/Nationalist Skinheads are the most prevalent. On social networks, Traditional Skinheads and Racist/Nationalists are the most prevalent. The most dominant cultural element, regardless of Skinhead identity, was music, with references to beer, clothes, scooters, and tattoos varying by group. Pornographic images were the most prevalent on Gay Skinhead web pages. Racist/Nationalist webpages were more likely to have been updated recently, include recruitment information, and have links to Other Skinhead groups. The results suggest a diversity and complexity to Skinhead culture.

T1  - "Not helping out": classed strategies of the (non) contribution of children in immigrant family businesses
AN  - 1913883009
AB  - This article analyses the role of immigrant entrepreneurs' class positions in understanding the participation of children in business activities. Immigrant entrepreneurship scholarship has highlighted how the participation of children depends on relations of reciprocity as well as on the lack of opportunities in paid employment. I argue that the (non) contribution of children has to do with the social mobility strategies that migrant families put in place. Drawing on the narratives of fifty-five Latin American entrepreneurs and family members in Spain, I explain (i) the role of the small firm in trajectories of social mobility, (ii) how class positions explain the (non) participation of children, and (iii) the mechanisms by which downward mobility is cushioned through practices of distinction for middle-class entrepreneurs. The article contributes to nuance our understanding of the role of family ties in migrant firms by integrating the impact of class on the lives of migrants' children.

T1  - The rise of the second generation: aspirations, motivations and academic success of Chinese immigrants' children in Hong Kong
AN  - 1884516290
AB  - The second-generation immigrants' advantage in education has been observed in many destination countries, and often explained in terms of their family values and practices embedded with certain culture and positive selection on psychological factors. However, the roles of culture and selectivity have been hardly disentangled from each other. In this article, we examine the self-selection hypothesis in the context of Hong Kong, as its unique setting enables us to largely control for the effect of cultural factors and focus on the positive selection effect. We identify four psychological traits that could contribute to immigrants' outstanding performance, and employ mediation analysis to investigate how much of the effect of immigrant status on academic achievement is mediated through these factors. Analysis of data from the Programme for International Student Assessment in Hong Kong reveals that, having strong motivations to find a better life and high aspirations for upward mobility can largely explain Chinese immigrant children's academic success in Hong Kong, with educational aspiration playing a particularly important role. In addition, the net academic advantage of second-generation immigrants is larger among low socio-economic status (SES) families, and low SES immigrant parents have exceptionally high expectation and great dedication to their children's education.

T1  - The rich--love them or hate them? Divergent implicit and explicit attitudes toward the wealthy: GPIR
AN  - 1854785596
AB  - Adding to a growing body of work on the psychology of social class, the present research examined implicit and explicit attitudes toward rich people, standing out from much previous work that has focused on negative evaluations of people with low socioeconomic status (SES). Across three studies, we found that participants (who typically identified as middle class) implicitly, but not explicitly, favored the rich over the middle class. Although financial resources represent a continuum objectively, attitudes toward the rich seem to be conceptually distinct from evaluations of low-SES people. Additionally, we demonstrated that implicit prorich attitudes uniquely predict leniency on a rich driver who causes a car accident, while explicit attitudes do not predict such judgments. This work expands and clarifies knowledge of implicit wealth attitudes and suggests that implicit prorich attitudes are an important factor in understanding how social class influences daily life.

T1  - How norm violations shape social hierarchies: Those who stand on top block norm violators from rising up: GPIR
AN  - 1853502248
AB  - Norm violations engender both negative reactions and perceptions of power from observers. We addressed this paradox by examining whether observers' tendency to grant power to norm followers versus norm violators is moderated by the observer's position in the hierarchy. Because norm violations threaten the status quo, we hypothesized that individuals higher in a hierarchy (high verticality) would be less likely to grant power to norm violators compared to individuals lower in the hierarchy (low verticality). In 14 studies (N total = 1,704), we measured participants' trait verticality (sense of power, socioeconomic status, testosterone) and manipulated state verticality (power position, status, dominance). A meta-analysis revealed that higher ranked participants granted less power to norm violators than lower ranked individuals, presumably because the former support social stratification. Interestingly, these effects occurred for trait but not state verticality. Overall, negative reactions to deviants may be driven by hierarchy-maintenance motives by those in privileged positions.

T1  - From apathy to obsession: the reactions of A. K. Chesterton and the British far right to imperial decline
AN  - 1835698144
AB  - Mulhall sets out to explain how, contrary to what one might expect, imperial decline was rarely a pressing issue for the British far right, usually falling below both the perceived threats of Communism and immigration on their list of priorities. By first explaining these unexpected findings and then placing them in an international comparative context, new evidence emerges that supports those imperial historians who subscribe to the 'minimal impact' orthodoxy regarding the effect of empire on the metropole. In addition, however, those aspects of the radical right that did concern themselves with imperial decline, namely A. K. Chesterton and the League of Empire Loyalists, are explored in depth, revealing a peculiarly British form of conspiratorial antisemitism that blamed imperial decline on secret Jewish power. This strand of conspiracy thinking, best articulated by Chesterton, is traced back to its origin so as to illuminate the continuity of ideas and ideologies between the interwar and post-war periods within the British far right. The result is an article that contributes to several existing historiographical debates and provides an exploration of a less well-known aspect of the work of A. K. Chesterton and conspiratorial antisemitism more generally.

T1  - Gradients in Depressive Symptoms by Socioeconomic Position Among Men Who Have Sex With Men in the EXPLORE Study
AN  - 1807594868
AB  - This study examines gradients in depressive symptoms by socioeconomic position (SEP; i.e., income, education, employment) in a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM). Data were used from EXPLORE, a randomized, controlled behavioral HIV prevention trial for HIV-uninfected MSM in six U.S. cities (n = 4,277). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (short form). Multiple linear regressions were fitted with interaction terms to assess additive and multiplicative relationships between SEP and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were more prevalent among MSM with lower income, lower educational attainment, and those in the unemployed/other employment category. Income, education, and employment made significant contributions in additive models after adjustment. The employment-income interaction was statistically significant, indicating a multiplicative effect. This study revealed gradients in depressive symptoms across SEP of MSM, pointing to income and employment status and, to a lesser extent, education as key factors for understanding heterogeneity of depressive symptoms.

T1  - Why do Asian Americans academically outperform Whites? - The cultural explanation revisited
AN  - 1793587480
AB  - We advocate an interactive approach to examining the role of culture and SES in explaining Asian Americans' achievement. We use Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) 2002 baseline data to test our proposition that the cultural orientation of Asian American families is different from that of white American families in ways that mediate the effects of family SES on children's academic achievement. The results support our hypothesis, indicating that: (1) SES's positive effects on achievement are stronger among white students than among Asian-Americans; (2) the association between a family's SES and behaviors and attitudes is weaker among Asian-Americans than among Whites; (3) a fraction of the Asian-White achievement gap can be accounted for by ethnic differences in behaviors and attitudes, particularly ethnic differences in family SES's effects on behaviors and attitudes. We find that Asian Americans' behaviors and attitudes are less influenced by family SES than those of Whites are and that this difference helps generate Asians' premium in achievement. This is especially evident at lower levels of family SES. [web URL: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X15300570]

T1  - More Than a Checklist: Meaningful Indigenous Inclusion in Higher Education
AN  - 1778778383
AB  - Since the 1970s there has been increased focus by institutions, government, and Indigenous nations on improving Aboriginal peoples participation and success in Canadian higher education; however disparity continues to be evident in national statistics of educational attainment, social determinants of health, and socio-economic status of Aboriginal compared to non-Aboriginal Canadians. For instance, post-secondary attainment for Aboriginal peoples is still only 8% compared to 20% of the rest of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008, 2013). A challenge within higher education has been creating the space within predominately Euro-Western defined and ascribed structures, academic disciplines, policies, and practices to create meaningful spaces for Indigenous peoples. Indigenization is a movement centering Indigenous knowledges and ways of being within the academy, in essence transforming institutional initiatives, such as policy, curricular and co-curricular programs, and practices to support Indigenous success and empowerment. Drawing on research projects that span the last 10 years, this article celebrates the pockets of success within institutions and identifies areas of challenge to Indigenization that moves away from the tokenized checklist response, that merely tolerates Indigenous knowledge(s), to one where Indigenous knowledge(s) are embraced as part of the institutional fabric.

T1  - Is socioeconomic incorporation associated with a healthier diet? Dietary patterns among Mexican-origin children in the United States
AN  - 1751218136
AB  - With each successive generation in the United States, Mexican-origin families lose their initial dietary advantages. Focusing on children's diets, we ask whether greater socioeconomic status (SES) can help buffer Mexican-origin children in immigrant families from negative dietary acculturation or whether it exacerbates these dietary risks. Pooling data from the 1999 to 2009 waves of the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we test whether the association between generational status and Mexican-origin children's nutrition varies by the family's SES. When predicting children's overall dietary quality using the Healthy Eating Index (2010) and predicting unhealthy dietary patterns, we find stronger evidence of segmented assimilation, whereby greater family average SES is associated with better diets across generations of Mexican-origin children. High-status Mexican-origin parents appear able to buffer their children against generational dietary declines documented in the acculturation literature.

T1  - Trusting Communities and Bigger In-Groups: Social Capital, Interracial Contact Climate, and Common In-Group Categorization
AN  - 1750356044
AB  - Contact with members of different groups can reduce prejudice and encourage people to recategorize members of other social categories. This research examines individual-level social capital--one's experience with trust, reciprocity norms, and engagement within a given community--as a construct that predicts contact climate and recategorization. People who have high levels of social capital within a community are more likely to perceive a positive interracial contact climate. High social capital and a favorable contact climate can encourage people to focus on their shared identity as members of that community. Two studies support the claim that social capital predicts intergroup processes. Study 1 tests a cross-sectional mediation model linking individual-level social capital to perceptions of the contact climate, common in-group categorization, and racial out-group attitudes. Study 2 presents longitudinal data demonstrating that social capital's cross-lagged effects on contact climate, categorization, and racial out-group attitudes are stronger than their reverse effects. Implications for diversity research and community applications are discussed.

T1  - Social Policy and Perceived Immigrant Labor Market Competition in Europe: Is Prevention Better Than Cure?
AN  - 1718065539; 201530983
AB  - Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Expanding the African-American Studies Paradigm to Include Health: a Novel Approach to Promoting Health Equity
AN  - 1929900433
AB  - Of all the forms of inequality, injustice in health [care] is the most shocking and inhumane. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King’s declaration in 1966 speaks to the unrealized ideal of equal and appropriate attention to health as a human right and is echoed by the World Health Organization, which describes “the highest attainable standard of health”as a “fundamental right of every human being” (WHO 2012). Proponents of social justice share this view and understand the paradigmatic shift in thought and deed necessary to bring this view to reality (Marmot and Bell 2009; Hofrichter 2003). Inherent in the perspective of holding health as a human right is the notion of the “universal cultural value” of health as an indicator of the well-being of a community and the status of its members (Pinkney 2000, p.131). When health is robust, communities flourish. When health is compromised, communities are weakened. For marginalized individuals and communities,the notion of health is a ubiquitous yet often suppressed concern, until it becomes too great to ignore. Even then, without appropriate resources and support, it can be difficult to significantly reverse the course of poor health outcomes. African Americans bear a greater burden of death and disease compared to Whites. This speaks to the reduced vitality of African-American communities and underscores a history of marginalized citizenship. Further, those with lower socioeconomic statuses (SES) do not fare nearly as well on indices of health as those with higher SES (Banks et al. 2006). The complex mix of race and class has had severe consequences on the health of African Americans, resulting in disparities in health and health care that for many constitute a public health crisis (Satcher Health Leadership Institute, n.d.). Addressing these disparities requires innovative, multi-pronged approaches. One such approach involves a targeted expansion of the African-American studies paradigm to include health.The purpose of this discussion is to offer justification for expanding the African-American studies paradigm using a public health-oriented approach, specifically grounded in health education and promotion, to examine health disparities as a point of emphasis with a focus on social determinants of health.This discussion also offers practical recommendations for incorporating health in Black studies and presents dual models of inclusion.

T1  - Inequality Preservation through Uneven Diffusion of Cultural Materials across Stratified Groups
AN  - 1700673149; 201525212
AB  - Inequality between groups is frequently maintained through the construction and legitimation of inter-group cultural differences. I draw on Blau's multiform heterogeneity and complex contagion models to theorize and develop a relational mechanism that shows how inequality can be preserved when additional, new bases of differentiating between groups layer over existing ones. I investigate the conditions under which variations in the distribution of the population across stratified groups and homophily of social networks along the stratifying attribute interact in such a way that a belief/practice diffuses widely in one group but not the other -- an outcome referred to as differential diffusion. I also analyze how size of ego networks and adoption thresholds affect differential diffusion. Using mathematical and agent-based models, I find a positive correlation between adoption thresholds and homophily: when social networks are highly homophilous (e.g., race and socioeconomic class), uneven diffusion of non-normative behavior reproduces inequality; inclusive networks (e.g., in diverse city schools), in contrast, reestablish inequality through differential diffusion of low-risk behavior. This suggests that cultivating diversity is likely to mitigate inequality preservation in conservative situations where adoption of new beliefs/practices needs considerable affirmation. Encouraging status-based solidarity is more appropriate in receptive contexts where adoption of new behaviors entails comparatively lower risk. The results also imply that analyses of diffusion need to be sensitive to contextual factors, including homophily, cultural institutionalization of the diffusing material, and population distribution. Finally, I extend Ridgeway's seminal work to show how relational structure can not only construct status hierarchies but also contribute to their symbolic maintenance.

T1  - The socio-economic well-being of internal migrants in Agbogbloshie, Ghana
AN  - 1788298813
AB  - The recent claims that migration can improve the well-being of migrants and their dependants back home has mainly focused on international migration to destinations that are considered developed. Few studies have focused on internal migration and its effects on migrants' wellbeing. Besides, whether migrations to areas that are considered not developed can also contribute to improving the well-being of migrants and their dependants back home remains unaccounted for in the literature. This study employed a quantitative design involving descriptive statistics, independent t- test and binomial test to examine the effects of internal migration on the wellbeing of migrants in Agbogbloshie-the most populous slum in Accra. The study found that the determinants of well-being; income, education and employment have improved for migrants after migration. The results implied that migration had a net positive effect on migrants' wellbeing. However, this benefit comes at a cost as migrant workers are engaged in works that post a lot of risk such as carrying very heavy loads, exposed to toxic substances and living in very poor accommodation. The paper recommends that efforts be made by governments to bridge the development gap between the north and south of the country so as to limit the rate of migration.

T1  - Is Racism a Fundamental Cause of Inequalities in Health?
AN  - 1735657136; 201536909
AB  - We previously proposed that socioeconomic status (SES) is a fundamental cause of health inequalities and, as such, that SES inequalities in health persist over time despite radical changes in the diseases, risks, and interventions that happen to produce them at any given time. Like SES, race in the United States has an enduring connection to health and mortality. Our goals here are to evaluate whether this connection endures because systemic racism is a fundamental cause of health inequalities and, in doing so, to review a wide range of empirical data regarding racial differences in health outcomes, health risks, and health-enhancing resources such as money, knowledge, power, prestige, freedom, and beneficial social connections. We conclude that racial inequalities in health endure primarily because racism is a fundamental cause of racial differences in SES and because SES is a fundamental cause of health inequalities. In addition to these powerful connections, however, there is evidence that racism, largely via inequalities in power, prestige, freedom, neighborhood context, and health care, also has a fundamental association with health independent of SES.

T1  - Racial Inequality Trends and the Intergenerational Persistence of Income and Family Structure
AN  - 1650145386; 201502135
AB  - Racial disparity in family incomes remained remarkably stable over the past 40 years in the United States despite major legal and social reforms. Previous scholarship presents two primary explanations for persistent inequality through a period of progressive change. One highlights continuity: because socioeconomic status is transmitted from parents to children, disparities created through histories of discrimination and opportunity denial may dissipate slowly. The second highlights change: because family income results from joining individual earnings in family units, changing family compositions can offset individuals' changing economic chances. I examine whether black-white family income inequality trends are better characterized by the persistence of existing disadvantage (continuity) or shifting forms of disadvantage (change). I combine cross-sectional and panel analysis using Current Population Survey, Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Census, and National Vital Statistics data. Results suggest that African Americans experience relatively extreme intergenerational continuity (low upward mobility) and discontinuity (high downward mobility); both helped maintain racial inequality. Yet, intergenerational discontinuities allow new forms of disadvantage to emerge. On net, racial inequality trends are better characterized by changing forms of disadvantage than by continuity. Economic trends were equalizing but demographic trends were disequalizing; as family structures shifted, family incomes did not fully reflect labor-market gains. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Phenotyping and Adolescence-to-Adulthood Transitions Among Latinos
AN  - 1616082366
AB  - Phenotyping the system of prejudice and discrimination, which gives preference to European physical characteristics and devalues those of Amerindians, Africans, and Asians, affects the lives of many Latinos in the US. This study examines the impact of phenotyping on academic and employment outcomes among Latino adolescents/young adults. Outcomes examined include the odds of graduating from high school, finding full-time employment after completing high school, and attending college. Socioeconomic status (measured at individual and school levels), family structure, quality of parent-child relationships, immigrant generational status, and other measures are included as controls. Multilevel modeling and logistic regression are utilized as analytical tools. Results indicate that, among Latinos, light skin and blue eyes are associated with better academic outcomes than having dark skin and brown eyes, while those with darker skin enter the labor market earlier than their light-skinned co-ethnics.

T1  - Who Is Black, White, or Mixed Race? How Skin Color, Status, and Nation Shape Racial Classification in Latin America
AN  - 1700675447; 201525326
AB  - Comparative research on racial classification has often turned to Latin America, where race is thought to be particularly fluid. Using nationally representative data from the 2010 and 2012 America's Barometer survey, the authors examine patterns of self-identification in four countries. National differences in the relation between skin color, socioeconomic status, and race were found. Skin color predicts race closely in Panama but loosely in the Dominican Republic. Moreover, despite the dominant belief that money whitens, the authors discover that status polarizes (Brazil), mestizoizes (Colombia), darkens (Dominican Republic), or has no effect (Panama). The results show that race is both physical and cultural, with country variations in racial schema that reflect specific historical and political trajectories. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The 'Immigrant Paradox' Phenomenon: Assessing Problem Behaviors and Risk Factors Among Immigrant and Native Adolescents
AN  - 1680154443; 201513914
AB  - We investigated the 'immigrant paradox' phenomenon by examining differences in problem behavior engagement and exposure to risk factors across four adolescent groups: 1,157 first-generation, 1,498 second-generation, and 3,316 White and minority third or higher generations. Latent mean differences in problem behavior engagement (i.e., academic failure, aggression, and substance use) and risk factors (i.e., low socioeconomic status, poor family relationship, and low sense of school belonging) were associated with significant differences across adolescent groups. Results supported the generational status effect by demonstrating sequentially greater adolescent problem behavior engagement. However, the difference in exposure to risk factors across adolescent groups only partially supported the immigrant paradox. Further, the multiple group analysis of the relationships between risk factors and engagement in problem behaviors showed increased susceptibility among second generation immigrants for substance use, White natives for academic failure and substance use, and minority natives for physical aggression. Study findings have implications for understanding how the immigrant paradox leads to different adjustment patterns and problem behavior manifestations among immigrant and native adolescents.

T1  - What Makes Muslims Feel French?
AN  - 1660021864; 201505717
AB  - In this article, we analyze the extent to which Muslims self-identify as French. A common interpretation of Muslim political attitudes assumes that Islam fundamentally conflicts with mainstream European society and that when Muslims are more attached to their religion they will be less likely to identify as French. We examine this assumption by exploring whether Muslim national identification is more strongly related to religiosity or other factors such as socio-economic status, social networks, and immigrant integration. Our results offer some support for each explanation, but we find that religiosity is not the dominant force shaping Muslims' attitudes. Instead, factors associated with immigrant integration have the most profound relationship with Muslim identification. These conclusions are supported by the fact that religiosity and immigrant integration variables have similar effects on the national identification of Christian immigrants. Our findings suggest that focusing on religiosity is not the best way to analyze Muslims' attitudes or identities, and that tensions surrounding Muslims' self-identification with France are likely to decrease in future generations, as immigrant integration proceeds through the increased prevalence of birth in France, having French citizenship, and French language fluency.

T1  - Psychosocial Profile of Mexican American Youths Who Play Aggressive Video Games
AN  - 1700676454; 201525255
AB  - The effects of video games on youths have been subject to debate. Some researchers have linked video games to behavioral and emotional problems, while others have found no adverse effects. The behavioral and emotional problems experienced by some gamers may be linked to certain types of video games. We hypothesized that Mexican American youths with lower socioeconomic status and who play 'aggressive' video games have more emotional and behavioral problems than those who do not play such games. We examined a total of 579 youths using the Child Behavior Checklist and analyzing the games played within the last 6 months. Youths who played aggressive video games had higher scores and more emotional and behavioral problems compared with those who did not play aggressive video games.

T1  - Cosmopolitanism: Religion and kinship among young people in south-western Sydney
AN  - 1567044998; 201435230
AB  - Debates about globalization have been accompanied by considerable critical assessment of the notion of cosmopolitanism. The upsurge in travel, trade, communication, and resettlement among non-elite individuals and groups has raised questions about the nature and form of 'bottom-up' or 'vernacular' cosmopolitanism. This article explores the ways in which the experiences of a group of young people (12-15 years of age) in south-western Sydney contribute to shared practices of membership in a culturally differentiated society. On one level, these young people display a de facto vernacular cosmopolitanism through familial experiences of migration. However, the article shows how these young people often move within socially and culturally bounded communities defined by ethnicity, language, socio-economic status, shaped by desires for safety, support and belonging, and maintained by propinquity, religion and the persistence of traditional expectations and patterns around gender and inter-marriage.

T1  - Routing Black Migration to the Urban US South: Social Class and Sources of Social Capital in the Destination Selection Process
AN  - 1512220470; 201408869
AB  - This article examines sources of migrant social capital (i.e. social networks and institutional assistance) that facilitated destination selection among African American migrants to a US southern metropolitan area-Charlotte, North Carolina. Charlotte is an emerging magnet city in the net in-migration of blacks to the US South since the 1970s. While research on black migration to the South suggests that family ties assist migrants in selecting destinations, scholars speculate that family ties are less important for migrants of high socio-economic status, who are born outside the South or who move to urban areas. Using qualitative narrative interviews with non-southern-born black migrants to Charlotte, this study identifies other sources of assistance that route blacks to their destination-employers, educational institutions (especially historically black colleges) and the ethnic media. Working-class migrants relied primarily on family and friends when selecting their destination, but middle-class migrants relied on a broader range of sources. Implications for theory about how class shapes the destination selection process are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Snakes and Ladders in Educational Systems: Access to Higher Education for Second-Generation Turks in Europe
AN  - 1512218884; 201408779
AB  - Based on the first international standardised survey on the second generation in Europe, I compare the school trajectories of youth from the same origin group (parents born in Turkey), with the same starting position (born in Europe) and the same socio-economic status (parents with only modest educational credentials) in six European countries. The differences between countries are substantial. The opportunity to enter higher education is seven times greater in the highest-performing country than in the lowest. These differences can be explained by the institutional arrangements in education in interaction with the available family resources. The article highlights the importance of the oft-neglected national school context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Stereotypic Crimes: How Group-Crime Associations Affect Memory and (Sometimes) Verdicts and Sentencing
AN  - 1448992658; 201342939
AB  - Stereotype-based judgments in the legal system can be particularly damaging. In Experiment 1, we surveyed 179 participants to assess which of 55 crimes they viewed as stereotypical of 13 groups of people. Stereotypic crimes based on ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, and age were found. We used these results to create crime scenarios for Experiments 2 and 3 that unconfounded crime stereotypicality and crime violence. We then examined the effects of stereotypic crimes with black or white defendants on mock jurors' memories and decisions. Memory biases were found in line with the stereotypic crimes. Offenders' verdicts and sentences were sometimes biased by stereotypic crimes. By unconfounding crime stereotypicality and violence, the results also demonstrate how violence influences biases in memories and decisions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Acculturation Expectations and Experiences as Predictors of Ethnic Migrants' Psychological Well-Being
AN  - 1417525368; 201331991
AB  - There is a need for a better acknowledgement of the pre- and postmigration factors that influence postmigration psychological adaptation of ethnic migrants. In the present study, first, we examined the effects of pre-acculturative stress, anticipated sociocultural difficulties, and anticipated discrimination on ethnic migrants' (N = 153) psychological well-being in the postmigration stage. These pre-migration factors were expected to influence postmigration acculturation experiences (i.e., perceived acculturative stress, sociocultural difficulties, and discrimination), which, in turn, were expected to be decisive for postmigration well-being. Second, we examined how the concordance between these premigration and postmigration factors affects postmigration well-being. According to the first set of results, (1) the effect of anticipated sociocultural difficulties on psychological adaptation is mediated by perceived sociocultural difficulties and acculturative stress in the postmigration stage, and (2) the effects of pre-acculturative stress and anticipated discrimination are present in terms of their impact on subsequent postmigration experiences (stress and discrimination, respectively), which are further associated with postmigration well-being. The second set of results, in turn, shows that ethnic migrants' psychological adaptation is highest (1) when both anticipated and perceived sociocultural difficulties are low and correspond with each other (but not when they anticipated more sociocultural difficulties than they experienced after migration), (2) when they both anticipate and perceive low levels of ethnic discrimination, and (3) when their perceived acculturative stress after migration is lower than pre-acculturative stress. The implications of the results for premigration interventions are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Anti-Asian Sentiment Amongst a Sample of White Australian Men on Gaydar
AN  - 1357006258
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Whilst the homogenizing descriptor 'gay' is often used in a singular sense to refer to 'the gay community,' research has increasingly recognized that individuals within gay communities are as diverse as they are within the broader community. Importantly, recognition of this diversity requires an acknowledgement of the fact that, just as in the broader community, discrimination occurs within gay communities. The present study sought to examine the degree to which racism occurs within gay men's online communities (in the form of anti-Asian sentiment expressed in the profiles of a small number of the 60,082 White Australian gay men living in five major Australian states whose profiles were listed on the website gaydar.com.au during October 2010), the forms that such racism takes, and whether any White gay men resisted such racism. The findings report on a thematic and subsequent rhetorical analysis of the profiles of the sub-sample of 403 White gay men who expressed anti-Asian sentiment. Such sentiment, it was found, was expressed in four distinct ways: 1) the construction of racism as 'personal preference,' 2) the construction of Asian gay men as not 'real men,' 3) the construction of Asian gay men as a 'type,' and 4) the assumption that saying 'sorry' renders anti-Asian sentiment somehow acceptable. Whilst the numbers of White gay men expressing anti-Asian sentiment were relatively small, it is suggested that the potential impact of anti-Asian sentiment upon Asian gay men who view such profiles may be considerable, and thus that this phenomenon requires ongoing examination.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An Argument for Separate Analyses of Attitudes Toward Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual Men, Bisexual Women, MtF and FtM Transgender Individuals
AN  - 1357006002
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              While past research has certainly investigated a variety of correlates of U.S. attitudes toward lesbians, gays, bisexual men, bisexual women, male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transgender (LGBT) individuals, there are no U.S. quantitative studies that could be located that examined attitudes toward each of these groups separately. This is especially important because efforts to combat prejudices are likely to be most successful if they are based in research that explores how attitudes are both similar and different across specified targets of prejudice. Toward that goal, this essay underscores the significance of examining U.S. attitudes toward LGBT individuals as separate constructs. Both the gender and sexual orientation of the target of prejudice and the gender and sexual orientation of the respondent are highlighted as important constructs that should be considered when investigating U.S. attitudes toward LGBT individuals. First, I review previous U.S. studies that have examined attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Second, I offer arguments for how the intersections of gender and sexual orientation may affect attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Third, I discuss future considerations in studies of attitudes toward LGBT individuals in the context of multiple intersectionalities. I suggest that U.S. initiatives to reduce sexual stigma, gender nonconformity stigma, and transgender stigma should be grounded in research that highlights prejudicial attitudes as they vary by the target of prejudice and the respondents' characteristics.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Intersectional understandings of disability and implications for a social justice reform agenda in education policy and practice
AN  - 1417526696; 201331981
AB  - This article explores the multiple and shifting ways in which disability intersects with other sources of social disadvantage. Disablism forms part of an intricate web of social conditions that subjugate certain forms of 'student-subjects' and create compounding forms of oppression and exclusion that need to be addressed through relevant education policy and practice. Intersectional understandings of disability expose the multiple dynamics that impact upon constructing disabled students' identities. These identities should not be regarded as fixed and transcendental entities gauged against varied bodily, mental and psychological differences, but should be understood in conjunction with the ways in which race, gender and socio-economic status intersect with the experience of disability. Intersectional understandings of disability, drawn from intersectional feminism and disability studies, destabilize reductionist accounts of individual pathology and privilege new forms of pedagogical thinking and acting that prioritize a social justice framework in tackling wider systemic rigidities and oppressive educational regimes.

T1  - Colorism and School-to-Work and School-to-College Transitions of African American Adolescents
AN  - 1494750546; 201402139
AB  - Using multinomial logistic modeling, the current study estimated the impact of skin tone on school-to-work and school-to-college transitions of African American youths. The findings suggest that African American males with the lightest skin tone were more likely to find a job and to be in college than their co-racial peers with darker skin tones. The odds of finding a full-time job were also significantly higher for African American females with the lightest skin tone. Generally, the multivariate results reveal that among the effects examined in this study, the family background factors, marital status, prior achievement, and average school socioeconomic status matter the most.

T1  - Why are teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education socially biased? A mixed-methods research
AN  - 1551002755; 201430206
AB  - The consequences of educational differentiation have been at the centre of research in sociology of education during the past decades. Processes of educational allocation have, however, received much less attention. Despite the fact that research has shown that teacher recommendations in France and Germany are partly determined by pupils' social background, studies that inquire into the causes of this social bias seem to be virtually inexistent. This study aims to examine whether teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) are also socially biased, and if so what causes these differentials in advice, using a mixed-methods design. We found the advice given by primary school teachers to be partly determined by pupils' social background. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that teachers tend to evaluate pupils from low socio-economic status backgrounds less positively, due to their emphasis on specific pupil characteristics.

T1  - Do Muslims in Germany Really Fail to Integrate? Muslim Integration and Trust in Public Institutions
AN  - 1322723519; 201310748
AB  - Multivariate analysis of 2008 data from the German Social Survey (ALLBUS) provides firm evidence on the basis of one important dimension of political integration-individuals' trust in the political system-that Muslims are integrating well into German society. The results are significant despite controls for multiple indicators of respondents' social capital, socioeconomic status, post-material views, ideological position, partisan support for parties in power, assessment of government performance, interest in politics, and amount of television viewing. Furthermore, Muslims' level of religiosity does not influence their level of political trust. The findings raise new questions about integration in that the significantly lower levels of political trust found among non-Muslims may negatively affect their views of government and its efforts to respond to Germany's Muslim population. Skepticism and distrust of government by non-Muslim ethnic Germans may undermine important programs designed to bridge the actual value and cultural differences which remain the source of the ignorance that fuels prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Social Class Identification Among Black Americans: Trends and Determinants, 1974-2010
AN  - 1266146569; 201300385
AB  - Although much research documents the growth of a "professional middle class" among African Americans over the past several decades, we know comparatively little about how Blacks see themselves in social class terms, and whether this has changed over time. In the current study, we use data from the 1974 to 2010 General Social Surveys to analyze trends in, and the determinants of, Blacks' social class identifications (SCI) over the past four decades. Our results show that Blacks' tendency to identify as "middle class" has increased in concert with Blacks' socioeconomic status (SES) gains since the 1970s. Regarding the determinants of SCI, education and household income appear more consequential than occupational prestige and self-employment in shaping Blacks' self-reports of their own class positions. Finally, we see little evidence of change over time in the relationship between various SES characteristics and SCI, with one exception: Self-employment has become a more potent predictor of Blacks' SCI over the past several decades. Our results provide an important update to our knowledge of the dynamics of SCI among Black Americans. They also raise important questions for future research on the relationship between, and relative impact of, "race" and "class" in shaping Blacks' identities and their orientations toward American society.

T1  - The paradox of mixing: identities, inequalities and perceptions of discrimination among Brazilian browns
AN  - 1347783110; 201318905
AB  - A key but understudied element of Brazilian race relations is the perspective of those who are identified as brown, the ethno-racial identification that has increased the most in the last Censuses. Historically, Brazilian browns share with blacks a lower socioeconomic status, but systematically perceive less racial discrimination when compared to them. The focus on the perceptions showed by the browns allow us to analyze two key issues of Brazilian race relations, racial identification and the measurement of discrimination, from an original perspective. In order to follow this path, we rely on survey data as well as on in-depth interviews with people who are identified as brown according to Brazilian census categories, exploring their perceptions, strategies and definitions of racial and symbolic boundaries.

T1  - Civilizing vs destructive globalization? A multi-level analysis of anti-immigrant prejudice
AN  - 1125218007; 201240235
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the latest wave of globalization on anti-immigrant prejudice. We discern and test two contradictory accounts of the impact of globalization on anti-immigrant prejudice from the prejudice and globalization literatures. On the one hand, there is the 'civilizing/integrative globalization' thesis, which implies that globalization should help to decrease prejudice by creating sustained and equal contact between previously alien cultures and peoples, and by spreading economic gains to everybody. On the other hand, there is the 'destructive globalization/globalization as a threat' thesis, which argues that globalization should increase anti-immigrant prejudice by intensifying competition over resources and by increasing perceived threat by native populations as a result of increasing immigrant populations. We test these two accounts using a multi-level analysis of 64 countries and nearly 150,000 individuals, derived from the World Values Surveys (waves 3-5). Our analyses reveal support for 'destructive globalization/globalization as a threat' thesis, but emphasize the multi-dimensional character of globalization. We find that citizens of countries with higher levels of trade openness have significantly more anti-immigrant sentiments. There is also some evidence that in countries where unemployment is accompanied by high levels of trade openness or the existence of large immigrant populations, citizens hold high anti-immigrant prejudice. By contrast, foreign direct investment (FDI) has a weak effect. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Ltd., copyright holder.]

AB  - Recovering Lombroso's Jewish identity is important for understanding the context in which he lived and worked. Italian statehood and positivist science had particular meaning relative to Jewish emancipation. Lombroso turned his back on Judaism and Jewish tradition, but interacted over the years with a circle of Jewish colleagues. Salvatore Ottolenghi, Pauline Tarnowsky, Helen Zimmern, Max Nordau and Jean Finot influenced his professional life in more than one way, as did members of his family, such as David Levi. Lombroso contributed to the defence of Jews from the surge of anti-Semitism in the late nineteenth century and he even managed a measure of critical analysis in his discussion of Jews and crime. Although he failed to overcome the prejudices and misconceptions at the centre of his outlook, the Lombroso who engaged 'the Jewish question' emerges as a more complicated and conflicted character than the Lombroso associated with 'the criminal man'.

T1  - Population Trends and Late-Life Disability in Hispanics From the Midwest
AN  - 919904988; 201201686
AB  - Objectives: To describe the growth of the Hispanic population in the Midwest states of the United States, to present disability levels in older Mexican and non-Mexican-origin Midwest Hispanics by place of birth and poverty status, and compare disability levels among older Midwest Hispanics with those among Southwest Hispanics as well as non-Hispanics Whites and African Americans in each region. Method: Population data come from decennial U.S. Census Bureau surveys. Disability data for adults >= 50 years old come from the 2008 American Community Survey. Results: The Hispanic population in the Midwest has tripled since 1980 and now constitutes 6.6% of the entire Midwest population. Older Midwest Hispanics are somewhat younger, have a higher male-female ratio, and are more likely to be born outside the continental United States than Southwest Hispanics. In the Midwest, foreign-born Mexican American men report the lowest disability levels. Foreign-born Hispanic women of non-Mexican origin report the highest disability levels. Overall, older Hispanics have intermediate disability levels relative to non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans. Midwest Hispanics report less disability than Southwest Hispanics. Discussion: There is substantial heterogeneity in late-life disability among Midwest Hispanics, which may be related to place of birth and of origin. Future research is needed to examine age at immigration and health selection as potential reasons for low disability levels among foreign-born Mexican American men.

T1  - Foreign-born health integration during the transition to adulthood: The case of weight
AN  - 919904059; 201201657
AB  - Nativity differences in youths' health in the United States are striking -- the children of foreign-born parents often have healthier outcomes than those of native-born parents. However, very little is known about how immigrant-native differences evolve within the same individuals over time, or about life cycle aspects of the health-related integration of youth with migration backgrounds. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I examine nativity differences in trajectories of weight gain during adolescence and early adulthood, as well as the degree to which temporal patterns are stratified by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. I examine whether nativity differences converge, diverge or remain stable over time, and whether patterns are socially stratified within and across nativity groups. I find that first-generation adolescents begin at a lower weight than their third generation peers and gain weight at a significantly slower pace, resulting in meaningful differences by early adulthood. More complex examination of the relationship between nativity and weight gain reveals additional differences by ethnicity: the foreign-born advantage over time does not extend as strongly to Hispanic adolescents. The findings demonstrate how the health-related integration of foreign-born youth is tied to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic circumstances, and suggest the need to examine the ways in which social circumstances and health change together.

T1  - Understanding Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey: socio-economy, religion, and politics
AN  - 919903734; 201201634
AB  - In his recent article in Ethnic and Racial Studies, entitled 'Curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey', (Sarigil 2010) tests two rival hypotheses regarding Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey and, using data from the World Values Survey (WVS), finds that socio-economic status (levels of income and education) better explains the individual roots of Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey than does religiousness. In this paper, I offer both a methodological critique of Sarigil's research and a replication of his model with a more appropriate sample. I first argue that Sarigil's research design lacks internal validity because it studies Kurdish nationalism within a sample that predominantly consists of Turks, which invalidates his findings. I then replicate and expand Sarigil's model within a specific sample of Kurdish-speaking people in Turkey. The results show dramatic changes. Religiosity and political satisfaction seem to be better predictors of support for Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey than do socio-economic factors. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - IQ, Socio-economic and Intellectual Achievements of Ashkenazi Jews
AN  - 1520341425; 201413266
AB  - Ashkenazi (European) Jews have high average earnings, educational attainment, socio-economic status, and intellectual achievements. It is proposed that these can be at least partially explained by their high average IQ, which is estimated at 110. The Mizrahim (Oriental) and the Ethiopian Jews have lower IQs, estimated 91 for the Mizrahim and 70 for the Ethiopian Jews. There have been three principal explanations offered for the high average IQ of the Ashkenazi Jews. These are the Eugenic, the Persecution, and the Discrimination hypotheses. All provide plausible explanations and it may well be that all three of the factors they point to have contributed to this remarkable phenomenon. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Development and Initial Validation of the Internalization of Asian American Stereotypes Scale
AN  - 914767904; 201200199
AB  - This research consists of four studies on the initial reliability and validity of the Internalization of Asian American Stereotypes Scale (IAASS), a self-report instrument that measures the degree Asian Americans have internalized racial stereotypes about their own group. The results from the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses support a stable four-factor structure of the IAASS: Difficulties with English Language Communication, Pursuit of Prestigious Careers, Emotional Reservation, and Expected Academic Success. Evidence for concurrent and discriminant validity is presented. High internal-consistency and test-retest reliability estimates are reported. A discussion of how this scale can contribute to research and practice regarding internalized stereotyping among Asian Americans is provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Stigma of Obesity: Does Perceived Weight Discrimination Affect Identity and Physical Health?
AN  - 917532574
AB  - Obesity is widely recognized as a health risk, but it also represents a disadvantaged social position. Viewing body weight within the framework of stigma and its effects on life chances, we examine how perceived weight-based discrimination influences identity and physical health. Using national survey data with a 10-year longitudinal follow-up, we consider whether perceptions of weight discrimination shape weight perceptions, whether perceived weight discrimination exacerbates the health risks of obesity, and whether weight perceptions are the mechanism explaining why perceived weight discrimination is damaging to health. Perceived weight discrimination is found to be harmful, increasing the health risks of obesity associated with functional disability and, to a lesser degree, self-rated health. Findings also reveal that weight-based stigma shapes weight perceptions, which mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and health. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - To be 'cool' or not to be 'cool': young people's insights on consumption and social issues in Rio de Janeiro
AN  - 862597929; 201111184
AB  - Given the importance of material goods consumption to young people and the perception that to be 'cool' is fundamental to identity construction, this study investigates consumption in relation to social, economic and cultural inequalities. Qualitative individual interviews took place in November 2005, in Rio de Janeiro, with 14 high school students, age range 16-18, from public and private schools, and diverse backgrounds. In the context of global changes, Brazil is pushed towards a more advanced economic development, though basic needs of most of its population are not met. Serious contrasts continually reinforce and reproduce social and economic inequalities, through prejudice and segregation based on race, gender, residence and origin. Poor youngsters face the challenges of living in a globalised but unequal society, such as inadequate education, transition from school to labour markets, unemployment and less social participation. The data suggested that consumption is important to provide the feeling of being 'cool', 'fitting in' and experiencing inclusion though inequalities are an obstacle to consumption. In divided societies, to consume or dream of consuming create illusions of belonging to different classes, and escaping from poverty; however, respondents argued that education is the most important factor for improving social and economic conditions.

T1  - Crisscrossing Gender, Ethnicity, and Race: African Religious Legacy in Cuban Contemporary Women's Art
AN  - 1125221033; 201242096
AB  - Despite the many redistributive social policies that the Cuban Revolution implemented, the crisis of the Special Period has had severe consequences for Afro-Cubans, who are overrepresented in the poorer sectors of Cuban society. At the same time, the loss of many social benefits and increased social competition have fueled previously underlying racial prejudices. Like other cultural manifestations, such as Cuban rap music, the visual arts have launched a public discussion about the growing social fracture set offby the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise of racial inequalities. From 1997 to 2011, the Queloides art exhibits have presented the work of a number of artists that are currently focusing their artistic practices on issues of race and racism. A strategy implemented in the artwork to contest social processes of racialization has been the representation of Afro-Cuban religious practices, previously marginalized or reduced to folklore. In this context, the use of the Afro-Cuban legacy enables women artists to reflect on the consistency of identity markers such as race, gender, and ethnicity. In this article, I am particularly interested in revealing how subjectivity informs this artwork and how it is conceived as a site for reinvention at which identity markers are restructured and redefined.

From 1997 to 2011, the Queloides art exhibits have presented the work of a number of artists that are currently focusing their artistic practices on issues of race and racism. A strategy implemented in the artwork to contest social processes of racialization has been the representation of Afro-Cuban religious practices, previously marginalized or reduced to folklore. In this context, the use of the Afro-Cuban legacy enables women artists to reflect on the consistency of identity markers such as race, gender, and ethnicity. In this article, I am particularly interested in revealing how subjectivity informs this artwork and how it is conceived as a site for reinvention at which identity markers are restructured and redefined.

T1  - The Impact of Immigrant Concentration in Spanish Schools: School, Class, and Composition Effects
AN  - 1018368573; 201212833
AB  - The existence of a negative correlation between the concentration of immigrants in certain schools and the school attainment of its students is a well-documented empirical conclusion in the American and European sociology of education, yet sociologists of education are still debating why the migrant (and ethnic) composition of schools has such an impact on results above and beyond individual characteristics. Using a Spanish survey study (INECSE, Evaluacion de la Educacion Primaria 2003, Madrid, 2005), this article intends to confirm and measure the poorer results of students in schools where immigrants are more highly represented. It also seeks to identify potential explanations to account for variation in attainment due to the concentration of immigrant origin students in some schools. In the literature, the empirical analyses that seek to explain this empirical regularity are far less frequent, despite the fact that the list of its potential causes includes several mediating mechanisms. We deal with three main groups of causes that could be responsible for this regularity: (i) micro-interactions or peer group effects; (ii) compositional effects-the pupil population is not randomly distributed on the school map but according to important features that determine their future school attainment (such as socio-economic status); and (iii) school/classroom effects-given their contextual characteristics, the quantity and quality of their human and material resources, some schools offer a less stimulating learning environment.

T1  - Did Segregation Increase as the City Expanded? The Case of Montreal, 1881-1901
AN  - 1018352070; 201213678
AB  - Montreal in 1881 was highly segregated along four distinct social dimensions: language, religion, socioeconomic status, and sector of employment. By 1901 the population had doubled, and we examine changes in residential distributions over the two decades. Despite the increased integration of certain groups, segregation remains high, and multiple dimensions are still discernible. In addition to long-established communities of French Canadians, Irish Catholics, and Anglo-Protestants, we see new streams of immigrants occupying their own patches in the urban fabric. To make meaningful observations of sociospatial changes over two decades, we used a geographic information system (GIS) to situate individual census households with spatial precision on 1 of 12,000 lots in 1881 and 30,000 in 1901, so that we could reaggregate them into meaningful districts of different scales and districts with identical boundaries for both years of observation, thereby overcoming the major methodological problems hindering previous comparative analyses. Coupling well-established statistical indexes of segregation and diversity in a GIS framework lends new analytic power to grasp the scale of phenomena and inquire into behavioral choices of nineteenth-century households. The empirical evidence shows how both concentration and diversity were built into the urban fabric. This study also offers methodological cues for comparative studies in other places and periods.

T1  - Who Hates Gender Outlaws? A Multisite and Multinational Evaluation of the Genderism and Transphobia Scale
AN  - 914767850; 201201320
AB  - Four independent studies conducted in three different countries evaluated the strength of the Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS; Hill & Willoughby, 2005), a recently developed measure of anti-trans sentiments and behaviors. Study 1 utilized the GTS to examine anti-trans attitudes among mental health professionals. Study 2 employed the GTS to evaluate the effects of personal contact with transpersons, conformity, and perceived threat to social cohesion on attitudes toward gender nonconformity. Study 3 examined the reliability, validity, and factor structure of the GTS among college students in the Philippines. Lastly, Study 4, conducted in Canada, used variables from the general literature on prejudice to create a comprehensive model predicting genderism and transphobia. Collectively, results of this multinational, multisite study further support the reliability and validity of the GTS and elucidate factors associated with anti-trans sentiments and behaviors.

T1  - Curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey: an empirical assessment of pro-Islamic and socio-economic approaches
AN  - 743047745; 201031798
AB  - Within the debates on curbing Kurdish ethno-nationalism in Turkey, the pro-Islamic approach puts emphasis on empowering the notion of 'Islamic brotherhood' between Turks and Kurds. The socio-economic approach, on the other hand, draws attention to improving the socio-economic status of the Kurds. By using World Values Survey data, this study tests these two distinct approaches. Logit estimates provide strong support for the socio-economic approach. Individuals with a better socio-economic status (i.e. higher level of education and income) are less likely to support Kurdish ethno-nationalist formations while religion-related factors do not have a significant impact. Some theoretical and policy implications are also provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Acculturative and neighborhood influences on subjective social status among Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers
AN  - 60355317; 201017626
AB  - Subjective social status (SSS) reflects an individual's perception of her/his relative position in the social hierarchy. However, little is known about culturally-relevant, multilevel predictors of low de la among low socioeconomic status (SES), minority populations. The goal of this study was to identify individual- and neighborhood-level variables predicting de la among 297 Spanish-speaking Latino immigrant smokers living in several locations in Texas, with an emphasis on the association of de la with acculturative and socioeconomic variables. Participants were recruited and enrolled through the National Cancer Institute's Cancer Information Service from August 2002 to March 2004. Determinants of de la were explored using a series of linear regressions. In analyses adjusting for demographics (including objective indicators of SES), speaking Spanish at home and work and living in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, respectively, were associated with low de la . However, in analyses including demographics, acculturation, and neighborhood characteristics, only income, education, and acculturation remained associated with de la . Consistent with results from a previous study in the area (Franzini & Fernandez-Esquer, 2006), less acculturation predicted low de la among immigrant Latino smokers. However, unlike previous research, these associations were maintained after controlling for SES. Results suggest that the density of less acculturated Latinos within economically deprived neighborhoods might account for the disappearance of neighborhood effects in the final model.
