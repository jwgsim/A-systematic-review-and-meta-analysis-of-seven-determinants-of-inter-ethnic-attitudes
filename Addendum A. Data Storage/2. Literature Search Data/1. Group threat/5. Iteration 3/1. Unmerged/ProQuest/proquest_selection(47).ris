T1  - Indigenous people, redistribution, and support for the political regime in Latin America
AN  - 2616790403
AB  - Political scientists agree that inequality harms the consolidation of democracy, raising fears that the erosion of public support for the political regime could lead to political instability, particularly when the distributive conflict is reinforced by ethnicity. Focussing on Latin America, the region with the world’s largest indigenous population and most unequal income distribution, this paper analyses to what extend socioeconomic inequalities lessen levels of support for the political regime, especially among indigenous people. We found—by applying multilevel regression analyses to Latinobarómetro survey databases for the years 2007–2017—that socioeconomic inequalities do affect citizens’ levels of regime support. However, indigenous people are no less likely to be supportive of the political regime than non-indigenous people, even in those countries that are more unequal according to the Gini coefficient or the poverty rate. Furthermore, indigenous people tend to express levels of regime support that are similar to the rest of society’s inclusive among those of lower socioeconomic status. These findings highlight the importance of moving towards a better understanding of how indigenous people see the political regime and its implications for democratic consolidation.

T1  - MEANINGS AND IMPACTS OF CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS IN THE U.S. SOUTH
AN  - 2577680352
AB  - How do citizens interpret contentious symbols that pervade their community? And what downstream effects does state protection of these symbols have on how citizens of different backgrounds feel they belong in their community? We approach these questions through the lens of race and Confederate monuments in the American South. We rely on two original surveys to illustrate 1) the symbolic meanings Americans attach to these monuments and 2) how state protection of them impacts residents’ feelings of belonging. We find that perceptions of Confederate monuments vary by race: White U.S. residents are drastically less likely to perceive them as symbolic of racial injustice than are Black U.S. residents. Further, state protection of Confederate monuments leads to a diminished sense of belonging among Blacks, while leaving Whites unaffected. This research moves beyond scholarship examining simple support for or opposition toward contentious symbols, developing a deeper understanding of what meaning those symbols can hold for individuals and what their impacts are on individuals’ feelings of belonging and engagement in their communities.

T1  - Why Immigrants’ Multiple Identities Matter: Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice
AN  - 2241814650
AB  - Immigrants and their descendants typically identify with ethnic, national, religious, and/or regional groups, in various combinations and with varying degrees of compatibility or conflict. Research and theorizing on these patterns of identification, as represented in this issue, suggest guideposts for future research and domains for policy development. Here, we identify some of the issues that warrant additional research and we consider implications of existing research on dual (or multiple) identification for the development and implementation of policies related to immigrants. Examples of the former include the need for careful specification of concepts, the consideration of multiple dimensions of identity, deeper examination of identity meanings, methodological extensions in time and space, and greater theoretical integration. Policy development will require greater attention to various identity combinations, advocacy for national inclusivity, the promotion of sites for positive intergroup contact, and maximizing the potential for immigrants with multiple identities to help bridge intergroup gaps.

T1  - Narrative Ethnographies of Diverse Faculty in Higher Education: "Moral" Multiculturalism among Competing Worldviews
AN  - 2017951321
AB  - Since the Civil Right Movement in the United States, African Americans and other diverse students have forged through "integrated" educational systems to terminal graduate degrees. Some studies suggest racial integration in U. S. schools made White participants less prejudiced toward others, although the data showed that after schooling, many Whites again lived (and still do) in segregated neighborhoods with separation in places of employment, churches, and social groups (Wells, Holme, Revilla, & Atanda, 2004). One diverse participant in this study asked whether, after decades of integration, there has been any real progress, citing excellent educational experiences with all Black teachers within the all Black schools where he grew up. Is it truly progress for diverse students when they are bussed across town to be treated as minorities in mostly White schools? More diverse students do graduate from college; however, the diversity rate of professors is still abysmal. This study reports the contextual experiences of three African American (one an administrator) and one Latina faculty member with decades of experience in the public educational system and as they engaged in the culture of higher education struggling with a moral multiculturalism-whether worldviews (therefore free speech) could be morally determined and whether they as diverse faculty truly belong and are truly respected.

T1  - The threat of racial progress and the self-protective nature of perceiving anti-White bias: GPIR
AN  - 1978440644
AB  - In two studies we tested whether racial progress is threatening to Whites and whether perceiving anti-White bias assuages that threat. Study 1 revealed that Whites primed with racial progress exhibited evidence of threat (lower implicit self-worth relative to baseline). Study 2 replicated the threat effect from Study 1 and examined how perceiving discrimination may buffer Whites' self-worth. After White participants primed with high racial progress attributed a negative event to their race, their implicit self-worth rebounded. Participants primed to perceive low racial progress did not experience fluctuations in implicit self-worth. Furthermore, among those primed with high racial progress, greater racial discounting (attributing rejection to race rather than to the self) was associated with greater self-worth protection. These studies suggest that changes to the racial status quo are threatening to Whites and that perceiving greater racial bias is a way to manage that threat.

T1  - From a threatening "Muslim migrant" back to the conspiring "West:" race, religion, and nationhood on Russian television during Putin's third presidency
AN  - 1933962041
AB  - This article analyzes official discourse of the nation during Vladimir Putin's third presidency, as reflected in Russian television coverage of Islam and migration. It argues that the replacement of earlier deliberately ambiguous definitions of Russian nationhood with clearly framed exclusive visions reflects the change in the regime's legitimation strategy from one based on economic performance to one based on its security record. In this context, the systematic promotion of Russian ethno-nationalism for the purpose of achieving the regime's general stability began not at the time of Crimea's annexation, as it is often assumed, but at the time of Putin's re-election amidst public protests in 2012. The goal of representing the authorities as attentive to public grievances in a society where opinion polls register high levels of xenophobia has prompted state-controlled broadcasters to use ethnoracial definitions of the nation that they had previously avoided. The media campaigns analyzed here also reflect abrupt changes in the precise identity of Russia's main Others. Such instrumentally adopted sharp discursive swings are unlikely to constitute an appropriate tool for societal consensus management and for the achievement of political stability in the long term.

T1  - Crossing the border: immigrant student identities in Swaziland schools
AN  - 1924017146
AB  - This paper sets out to explore how the resettlement of immigrant students in a host country and schooling context influenced the constitution, negotiation and representation of their identities. Data capture included a mix of semi-structured interviews, focus group interviews, observations and a researcher journal. Data were analyzed by means of the content analysis method. Findings were fivefold. First, the sociocultural context influenced the way immigrant students constructed their identities. Second, categorization was based on phenotypical features, accent, negative attitudes and stereotypical perceptions of immigrants by Swaziland society. Third negotiated identities were multiple in nature and rooted in their culture of origin. Fourth, self-determination was a strong trait of immigrants; reflected in their work ethic, in the resolution of culture conflicts, and in their drive to achieve linguistic competency. And fifth, psychosocial passing was consistent with second generation immigrants. New knowledge generated from this study revealed that African immigrants preferred to be clustered with Mozambican immigrants, as it provided solid ground from which they negotiated identities in Swaziland schools. Mozambican immigrants recruited other African immigrants into their cluster, which they referred to as the 'Chico nation'. And, the culture of non-Christian immigrants was suppressed to promote Christian religious beliefs and values.

T1  - Reducing the gap between leaders and voters? Elite polarization, outbidding competition, and the rise of secessionism in Catalonia
AN  - 1934044633
AB  - The ethnic outbidding thesis explains party polarization as a consequence of political changes amongst voters. We argued instead that party elites' extreme position on the national identity cleavage can help polarizing strategies to prevail over moderate strategies in a context of increasing political uncertainty, without previous voters' polarization. We test successfully this hypothesis in Catalonia by analysing the polarization of political parties and people's demands for self-government in Catalonia since the early 2000s. We also find that the result of this outbidding pattern of competition was a reduction in the gap between elites' and voters' views on national identity. The analysis employs a set of unique data on party elites and activists' national identity, from several surveys conducted on the delegates at party conferences of the main Catalan parties between 1996 and 2012. Our data provide empirical support for the argument that ethnic polarization is mainly an elite-driven process.

T1  - The moral contents of anti-atheist prejudice (and why atheists should care about it)
AN  - 1929442897
AB  - Anti-atheist prejudice is pervasive worldwide. Past research indicates that this is driven by perceptions of atheist immorality, yet such perceptions have not been explored in detail. Using Moral Foundations Theory and samples of U.S. Christians, we investigated whether anti-atheist prejudice is explained by atheists' perceived adherence to certain foundational moral values more than others. Study 1 participants completed measures of moral value endorsements from the perspective of a typical atheist. Study 2 participants read that either atheists or people in general strongly endorse one of five moral foundations. Anti-atheist prejudice was consistently explained best by perceived atheist concern for values of caring/compassion rather than fairness/justice, loyalty, deferential respect, or purity/decency. Findings suggest that efforts to reduce anti-atheist prejudice should emphasize atheists' capacity for kindness and caring.

T1  - Physical and mental health inequalities between native and immigrant Swedes
AN  - 1876465460
AB  - To study health inequalities between native and immigrant Swedes, we investigated differences in self-rated health (SRH), mental wellbeing (MW), common symptoms (CS), and persistent illness (PI), and if socioeconomic status (SES), negative status inconsistency, or social support could account for such differences. A secondary analysis was conducted on questionnaire data from a random adult population sample of 4,023 individuals and register data from Statistics Sweden. χ2 tests and binary logistic regressions were used to identify health differences and study these after accounting for explanatory variables. Compared with natives, immigrants more commonly reported negative status inconsistency, poorer SES, and poorer social support as well as poor SRH, very poor MW, and high level of CS but not PI. Significant differences were accounted for by work-related factors and social support. We encourage future research to address how pre- and peri-migration factors relate to immigrants' post-migration SES, social support, and health status. 
Policy Implications 
Given the relationship between work-related factors (employment status, hours worked per week, and income) and all health outcomes in this study, labour market interventions that facilitate the integration of immigrants into the labour market, and into occupations that better correspond with their capacity, will arguably have public health benefits. 
Feelings of loneliness was, in our study, important in accounting for immigrants' poorer self-rated health compared with natives'. Therefore, we endorse interventions that facilitate immigrants' social networking and integration and thereby reduce feelings of loneliness. 
Common physical and mental symptoms may be important indicators of health and we, thus, suggest these to be taken into account when developing ill-health prevention programmes.

T1  - A century of victimhood: Antecedents and current impacts of perceived suffering in World War I across Europe
AN  - 1906667295
AB  - The present study addresses antecedents and consequences of collective victimhood in the context of World War I (WWI) across 15 European nations (N=2423 social science students). Using multilevel analysis, we find evidence that collective victimhood is still present a hundred years after the onset of the war and can be predicted by WWI-related objective indicators of victimization at national and family levels. This suggests that collective victimhood is partly grounded in the actual experience of WWI. In addition, we show that sense of collective victimhood positively predicts acknowledgment of the suffering inflicted by one's nation on other countries during WWI. This is consistent with a social representation of WWI as involving a vast massacre in which nations were both victim and perpetrator. Finally, we find that objective indicators of victimization predict pacifism in divergent ways, with an indicator at the national level associated with more pacifist attitudes and an indicator at the family level being associated with less pacifist attitudes. This finding suggests that war-torn societies may have developed social representations favouring peaceful coexistence whereas, at the family level, victimization may still foster retaliatory tendencies.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN STEREOTYPE FLUENCY ON PREJUDICIAL EVALUATION OF TARGETS
AN  - 1891103877
AB  - Research examining heuristics suggests recalling more stereotypic behavior might be as effective as recalling counter-stereotypic behavior for reducing prejudice. This research had participants recall African-Americans behaving in stereotypic or counter-stereotypic ways under easy or difficult recall constraints. Results demonstrated that participants recalling more stereotyped behaviors were less prejudiced toward African-Americans compared to participants recalling fewer stereotypes. Moreover, participants who recalled counter-stereotyped behaviors were less prejudiced than participants who recalled stereotyped behaviors, but only under easy recall constraints. The results suggest it is the ease of stereotypic recall that informs prejudice rather than the content or amount of stereotypes recalled.

T1  - Multicultural experiences reduce prejudice through personality shifts in Openness to Experience
AN  - 1891309318
AB  - Across two studies we test the prediction that multicultural experiences reduce intercultural prejudice by increasing Openness to Experience. In Study 1, frequency of self-reported multicultural experiences was associated with greater openness and less ethnic prejudice, and openness explained the relationship between multicultural experiences and ethnic prejudice. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated a multicultural experience. Compared to those in a control condition, participants exposed to the cultural members and elements of foreign cultures reported being higher in Openness to Experience and expressed less prejudice toward these cultural groups. There was also some evidence that multicultural exposure, through openness, caused secondary transfer effects in prejudice reduction. Our findings suggest that exposure to multicultural environments can improve intercultural attitudes by personality shifts in Openness to Experience.

T1  - Strict fathers, competing culture(s), and racialized poverty: white South African teachers' conceptions of themselves as racialized actors
AN  - 1811357659
AB  - This article focuses in particular on four white South African female practicing P-12 teachers' narratives about their own racialized understanding of their classroom practice(s) and their (racio-cultural) self-identity. Each of the four participants reported growing up with what they described as 'strict fathers' and shared ways in which their self-identified 'white-Christian-Afrikaner' upbringing is at times in conflict with their political and pedagogical commitments as practicing teachers in contemporary South Africa. To better understand the concept of 'strict fathers' and its/their impact on these teachers I use George Lakoff's and Kevin Kumashiro's notions of 'framing' to examine teachers' conceptions of their racial upbringing and how they view this influence on their classroom practice. Through an engagement with whiteness literature from both the US and South Africa I discuss the implications of the simultaneity of both essentialist cultural-deficit racial discourse and socially inclusive racial discourse. Finally I discuss implications for future work on whiteness in education, for researchers in the US in particular, on what learning from a context outside the US offers as we continue to (re)theorize whiteness as it impacts teaching and learning.

T1  - Contesting Racialized Discourses of Homophobia
AN  - 1815617736
AB  - In the course of research concerning the experiences of gay and lesbian teachers in public schools, I discovered that teachers often construct racialized explanations of potential homophobia in their schools, including the expectation that black and Latino coworkers, parents, and students were more likely to be homophobic. By taking an intersectional approach to these narratives as a case study in the discursive construction of race and sexuality, this article shows how racism and homophobia are mutually sustained in everyday talk. This process of racializing homophobia not only further alienates gay and lesbian teachers of color, it also reinforces racial inequality more broadly. In addition to racializing homophobia discourse, many white research participants used racial discrimination as a comparative rhetorical strategy to make sense of the discrimination they experience as gays and lesbians. While this strategy was purportedly useful for combating discrimination, it is also troubling. First, it assumes a false dichotomy between race and sexual identity that further erases the experience of queer people of color, who must contend with both kinds of discrimination. Second, it posits a false equivalence, when in fact the unique histories and operations of each kind of marginality resist such facile comparisons.

T1  - Race, ethnicity and German identity: a media analysis of the 2010 world cup men's national soccer team
AN  - 1807590907
AB  - Enjoying a surge of national pride, the German media celebrated the 2010 German World Cup team's success in South Africa. A dominant theme in this coverage was the 'immigration background' of 11 of the 23 players on the team and their claim to German identity despite their ethnic diversity. Amid debate over the changing nature of German citizenship, the national team's 'multicultural kickers' became the focal point for those who wished to re-frame German identity. This article examines German newspaper and magazine coverage of the national soccer team emphasizing the role that media played in constructing competing definitions of the German citizen and nation.

T1  - Interrogating Race: Color, Racial Categories, and Class Across the Americas: PROD
AN  - 1773540195
AB  - We address long-standing debates on the utility of racial categories and color scales for understanding inequality in the United States and Latin America, using novel data that enable comparisons of these measures across both broad regions. In particular, we attend to the degree to which color and racial category inequality operate independently of parental socioeconomic status. We find a variety of patterns of racial category and color inequality, but that in most countries accounting for maternal education changes our coefficients by 5% or less. Overall, we argue that several posited divergences in ethnoracial stratification processes in the United States, compared with Latin America, might be overstated. We conclude that the comparison of the effects of multiple ethnoracial markers, such as color and racial categories, for the analysis of social stratification holds substantial promise for untangling the complexities of "race" across the Americas.

T1  - Identity, security and the nation: understanding the South Korean response to North Korean defectors
AN  - 1784139908
AB  - From the Cold War era of the 'veteran heroes' to the present view of escaped North Koreans in terms more akin to 'refugees' and sometimes even just 'migrants', perceptions of North Korean defectors in South Korea have changed as swiftly as the number and origins of Northerners entering the South have expanded. At the same time, government policy for these ethnic 'brethren' has evolved considerably, particularly as South Korea has seen fundamental shifts in its independent identity, with important repercussions for the way its citizens view themselves as a collective. This article explores some of the key influences behind changes to policy and perceptions regarding North Korean people in South Korea over the period from 1997 to 2012, by applying international relations theory on national identity and its role in policy formation and change through the need to secure different parameters within that identity.

T1  - Negotiating Partial Citizenship under Neoliberalism: Regularization Struggles among Filipino Domestic Workers in France (2008-2012)
AN  - 1776048108
AB  - This article examines the social and historical conditions of negotiations for expanding migrant domestic workers partial citizenship under neoliberal policies. It uses a case study of Filipino domestic workers struggling for regularization in the Parisian region, 2008-2012. Under Sarkozy's neoliberal immigration policy called chosen immigration, Hortefeux, the then Minister of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Cooperative Development, authorized case-by-case "regularization based on work" in his circular of 7 January 2008. Consequently, led by a coalition of trade unions, sans papiers (undocumented) collectives and migrant support groups, large-scale mobilizations occurred demanding rights-based regularization. Although undocumented Filipino domestic workers remained socially invisible during this campaign, a quiet, small-scale but unprecedented mobilization took place among Filipino sans papières. Based on 10 months of fieldwork, this article shows how the neoliberal tendency in the two policy areas of immigration and personal services opened up the opportunity for Filipino migrant women to have access to the institutional resources of the Private Household Workers (PHW) trade union and to break the deadlock of "double irregularity", that is, the dispossession of both their residential permit and labor contract. This case depended on the activism of a trade unionist of Filipino origin, a trailblazer who filled the structural hole between Filipino ethnic networks and the local domestic workers' movement. Among the outcomes are the rising consciousness among Filipinos of the usefulness of learning French, as well as a new narrative that incorporates the struggles of Filipino domestic workers in the PHW trade union history.

T1  - Tourist, local, or other?: Greek Canadian women and the heritage fling in Greece
AN  - 1751004605
AB  - This article examines the romantic and sexual encounters between Greek men and Greek Canadian women vacationing in Greece and addresses how constructions of Greek Canadian female sexuality are related to foreign and local Greek conceptions of femininity during these 'holiday flings'. Because of their Greek ancestry, Mediterranean 'looks', and familiarity with language and culture, Greek Canadian women exhibit ambiguous identities that uphold and cross boundaries between outsiders and insiders. Drawing on long-term fieldwork, I explore the conceptualizations of ancestral and national identity underpinning Greek women's erotic desires for Greek man who embody ethnic authenticity to them. Yet, Greek men thwart these desires when they subvert Canadian women's economic power through challenging their cultural literacy (such as a lack in language skills, etiquette, or sexual knowledge). This article addresses the question of how diasporic women's heterosexuality subjectivities -- bound up with hybrid ethnic and national affiliations -- take on different meanings across locales and times where transnational sex and romance are everyday occurrences.

T1  - Racialized Assimilation of Asian Americans
AN  - 1811730303
AB  - Because of the generally high socioeconomic attainments and high intermarriage rates of Asian Americans, it has been suggested that Asian Americans are reaching parity with whites and are assimilating to mainstream American society. However, other research shows the continued significance of race for Asian Americans regardless of their socioeconomic status and levels of acculturation. This article provides a review of recent research on socioeconomic attainment and intermarriage among Asian Americans as well as an overview of research on less studied but increasingly important indicators: residential outcomes, political participation, and mental health. We argue that Asian Americans are assimilating but in ways that differ from their European predecessors. In this process, racial/ethnic boundaries between Asians and whites may be solidified rather than dissolved, thus maintaining the significance of race for Asian Americans. We suggest that a racialized assimilation framework may best characterize the experiences of contemporary Asian Americans.

T1  - The Concept of the Black Subject in Fanon
AN  - 1752271441
AB  - In this article, Blackness is examined in relation to the conception of the subject. From this perspective, Frantz Fanon's subjectivity is a rallying point of critique to account for the ways in which such a subject is positioned in the existential realm of anti-Blackness. This calls for the ways in which the Black subject should be understood from its existential reality of subjection. The demand of the Black subject to be free from subjection essentially means that Blackness should tenaciously militate for liberation. This is the existential necessity in that the Black subject will move from the existential condition of dehumanization and to what Fanon calls new humanism.

T1  - Diffracted Diasporas: Trinidad's East Indians, Religio-Nationalism, and India's Independence
AN  - 1753038735
AB  - In August 1947, the euphoria generated by the creation of newly independent India and Pakistan was celebrated by peoples far removed from the Subcontinent, including among the descendants of Indian indentured laborers in the British island colony of Trinidad. Trinidad's East Indians reveled in the newfound freedom of their now-divided, overseas, ethnic compatriots. The masses of East Indians felt a surge of pride in the overthrow of colonial rule, evidenced by their attendance at parades, talks, and celebrations. In the months and weeks leading up to independence, East Indians debated the merits and disadvantages of partition. Some advocated firmly the idea of a unified ethnic "Indian" community in Trinidad, whereas others constructed clear boundaries between proponents of Pakistan versus India, thus fortifying tenuous and contingent divisions between Trinidad's Hindus and Muslims. This essay demonstrates that the culmination of Indian independence and partition exacerbated the diverging identities of Hindu and Muslim Trinidadians. I argue that Indian independence and the creation of Pakistan had global ramifications for the meaning of "Indian-ness" in the British colonies including Trinidad and elsewhere. East Indians' appeal to nationalism interrogates the construction of national and cultural identity spatially and temporally distant from the source, ultimately affirming the salience of a religio-national identity. Furthermore, the networks of communication established between Indians in places such as Trinidad, England, and the United States produced "diffracted" diasporic identities that were mediated through these interactions.

T1  - Playing the Jew: anti-Semitism and football in the twenty-first century
AN  - 1784145243
AB  - There are certain football clubs, mostly but not all in Europe, which have become known as being 'Jewish'. These clubs include Tottenham Hotspur in England, Ajax Amsterdam in the Netherlands and (with relation to its history) Bayern Munich in Germany. As it happens one club for each country. These clubs do not necessarily have actually Jewish players or supporters. Rather, the clubs' supporters self-identify as Jewish and are attacked by rival clubs' fans as if they are really Jewish. This acting out of being Jewish seems to have started around the 1970s. In this article I argue that this development coincides with the increasing integration of the countries of the European Union and a corresponding sense by many members of these nation-states that their countries are losing their political identity. Attacking the 'Jewish strangers' has become one way of asserting not just club but national identity. Conversely, the identification as 'Jewish' can be read as an affirmation of diversity against the fascistic pressure for a homogeneous national population.

All arose in the context of a widespread embrace of multiculturalism and cultural diversity. And all are keenly focused on the perceived threats posed by immigration. This paper examines immigration threat narratives constructed by four of these groups: the British National Party, the One Nation Party, the Tea Party Patriots, and the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps. Striking similarities in the narratives employed by these groups suggest the emergence of a transnational right-wing populist 'playbook'. The paper further argues that even when the direct electoral impact of such groups is relatively small, they have the potential to substantially reshape broader political discourse and public policy.

T1  - Exploring Social and Geographical Trajectories of Latin Americans in Sweden
AN  - 1735658729; 201536829
AB  - Close to 20 percent of the Swedish population are of immigrant origin; one in eight is foreign-born. About 45 percent of all immigrants originate from outside Europe and most of these have entered the country as refugees or relatives of refugees. Issues connected to immigration, including the number of immigrants, settlement patterns and level of social integration of ethnic minorities, have been much discussed in Sweden in recent decades. This paper focuses on the integration of Latin American immigrants in Sweden. It compares the level of integration - measured as educational achievement, labour market participation, income and housing - experienced by first and second generation migrants. I use register information allowing me to include all 1st and 2nd generation Latin Americans that have lived in Sweden between 1990 and 2006 (in total 127,000 individuals). Data are longitudinal, which means that individuals can be followed over time. I make use of the longitudinal material in order to study changes in residential patterns and in attempts to explain educational and employment outcomes for second generation Latin Americans. The general conclusion of the paper is that in terms of integration, LAC immigrants have an intermediate position compared to other immigrant categories; they are often better off than people from Africa and the Middle East but clearly below the level experienced by some other migrants, especially those from Western Europe. This cannot be explained by level of education. The average level of education is high for first generation immigrants from LA countries. For many people, the level of labour market participation and income increase over time but one important result of this analysis is that second generation Latin Americans seem to do less well in Sweden compared to many other second generation migrants.

T1  - You Moved Up, Did You Forget Us?: The Influence of African American Intra-familial Social Mobility on Extended Family Relationships
AN  - 1929900874
AB  - This study explored the extent to which changes in socioeconomic status influenced the willingness or ability of extended family members to adhere to family scripts regarding interaction and resource sharing. Ethnographic methodology was utilized to examine the lived experience of the members of one large, extended African American family with its roots in a rural area of North Carolina. The results suggest that interaction is maintained despite changes in socioeconomic status among family members but that the interaction is transformed as one rises in socioeconomic status. The results also suggest that certain levels of ambiguous loss may occur as a result of the changing family relationships.

T1  - The Panacea and Perfidy of Cross Racial Foster Care on Children Living in Cross Racial Foster (CRF) Care Placements: Implications for Children's Needs and Rights
AN  - 1799007656
AB  - Internationally, regionally and in various national contexts, cross-racial foster care (CRFC) placement has been receiving wide debates and discourses with regards to its relevance and effectiveness as an option of custody for children in need of care and protection. The aim of this paper is, through a review of literature methodology, to discuss and debate the panacea and perfidy of the CRFC placements in the contemporary South African context with unrelenting burgeoning cases of orphans and vulnerable children in need of alternative care. The following aspects of CRFC were considered beneficial or a panacea: They offer vulnerable children (orphans) an opportunity for a second alternative care; a forum of ensuring vulnerable children get their basic needs such as food and shelter; offers an opportunity for acculturation to take roots. Contrastingly, the following aspects were considered undesirable or perfidious: possible loss of children's identity; discrimination and prejudice; loss of natural attachment; and challenges of adjusting to a new racial milieu. The paper is theoretically premised on the Systems theory. The paper recommends: training of cross racial foster care parents; as well as having the Department of Social Development to launch strong awareness campaigns to make the public understand the importance of CRFC placements in the country

T1  - Effect of Romantic Relationship on Implicit Regional Prejudice
AN  - 1728660288; 201533948
AB  - The study measures both the implicit regional prejudice and the explicit simple attitude of 93 students of five universities in China, either involved or not in different stages of a romantic relationship and at varying distances from their partners, by using the Brief Implicit Association Test and Explicit Reports. Results indicate that close relationships can contribute significantly to decreasing implicit regional prejudice. Further studies are needed to provide support for the causal mechanism between interpersonal relationships and changes in social attitudes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Créolisation, Créolité, Martinique, and the Dangerous Intellectual Deception of "Tous Créoles!"
AN  - 1635434761
AB  - Glissant's approach to creolisation does pose pivotal questions especially when considered from the perspective of the Martiniquan experience. Privileging a pragmatic posture, it evidently does not account for the climactic symbolic discrepancy and unavoidable moral pressure that powerfully define the conscious and unconscious outlook on the respective African and European identity constituents as they are related to culture and race, which in turn determine the ethics of the said creolisation. The latter is unbendingly advocated as a process in which all parts are proportionally and "categorially" analogous. Glissant proposed a project aiming at reshaping the way one does Relation in the world. He did so from the model elaborated by the epistemological work of the African, a party that is constantly disparaged. However, he does not do this party justice by making first and unembiguously explicit the particularizing nature of its work. The African critical philosophical contribution is not earnestly rendered. It is this African philosophical input that provides the process and its result, their substantial meaning and distinguishing specificity. I would therefore like to discuss the axiological implications of Glissant's pragmatic assertion to show how, carrying this pitfall, the formalization and systematization of creolisation sow confusion and exacerbate negationism as well as the everlasting sets of prejudice held against Africa as evidenced in Martinique.

T1  - Toward a Minority Culture of Mobility: Immigrant Integration into the African-American Middle Class
AN  - 1667952536; 201509460
AB  - Two important social transformations have occurred since the 1960s: the rise of the Black middle class and the influx of immigrants from Latin, America, Asia and Africa. The cultural and economic outcomes for first- and second-generation Black immigrants are often linked to the Black poor/underclass. However, we understand little about the ways in which the Black middle class is a potential pathway of integration for immigrants. This paper reviews the sociological debates on the socioeconomic incorporation of immigrants and the racial and ethnic relations of new and old African-Americans. It discusses the important contributions of minority culture of mobility hypothesis for class-based theories of immigrant integration. We draw from the literature on social stratification, race relations and immigrant incorporation in order to chime in on the conversation about how becoming socially mobile in America may mean having similar social experience as the African-American or minority middle class. The paper also suggests ways to better analyze the relationship between identity, integration, space and generation in minority incorporation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Caravan wives' and 'decent girls': Gypsy-Traveller women's perceptions of gender, culture and morality in the North of England
AN  - 1660023931; 201505575
AB  - This paper examines the beliefs and practices that constitute gender among Gypsy-Traveller women and then attempts to discern the consequences that flow from these. It analyses gender ideology and expectations among women and the shared investment in the moral identity attached to being a good Gypsy-Traveller wife. The paper argues that 'Gypsy-Traveller woman' cannot be understood as an identity that stands apart from gender and racial oppression. It is within this context that the tension between change and permanence in gender relations is played out. It argues that the maintenance of cultural taboos embodied and symbolised in the surveillance of womens' bodies is an important issue that problematises the construction of Gypsy-Traveller women. It posits that the appeal to morality may represent as much an avoidance of anxiety as a defence of marked gendered divisions within Gypsy-Traveller society. The paper suggests that the demands of cultural survival play a significant role in framing the degree to which women are willing or able to challenge the status quo.

T1  - Emotional Response Profiles to Racial Discrimination: Does Racial Identity Predict Affective Patterns?
AN  - 1718065657; 201530716
AB  - The present study examined the association between racial identity and patterns of emotional responses to blatant and subtle racial discrimination vignettes in a sample of 129 African American college students. Using latent profile analyses, we identified eight patterns of emotional responses to the scenarios. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that racial identity was associated with these response patterns. Specifically, private and public regard were related to profiles in the blatant condition, while private regard, centrality, and nationalist ideology were related to profiles in the subtle condition. These findings suggest that there are varied ways in which African American youth respond emotionally to discrimination and that the significance and meaning that one places on race may affect these responses.

By focusing on the changing migration and security regimes at the turn of the twenty-first century, it analyzes the political emphasis on perceived 'threats' in light of theoretical debates about the 'securitization of migration', and in particular, the role of Islamic organizations as lobbyists which publicly protest against associations being made between the two policy fields. Their public protest is against provisions of the new Nationality Act (2000) and the Immigration Act (2005) that require immigrants to prove German language skills, to be able to support themselves, and to pass naturalization tests as well as against the lack of dual citizenship and local voting rights. In addressing these issues, Islamic umbrella organizations expand their traditional scope of advocacy work to achieve religious rights for Muslim individuals and organizations, such as the official recognition of Islamic umbrella organizations and the introduction of Islamic religious education in public schools.

T1  - Inter-ethnic relations in Meghalaya
AN  - 1660020419; 201505647
AB  - The Indian state of Meghalaya, since its creation in 1972, had been raven by ethnic conflicts between the indigenous tribes and settler non-tribal communities. The domination of business establishments, labour force and other employment opportunities by settlers who are mainly economic migrants from Bangladesh, Nepal and other parts of India resulted in anxiousness among the native locals, resulting in three ethnic riots between indigenous tribals and settler non-tribal communities. By the turn of the twentieth century the state witnessed a relative change in the nature of relations between the ethnic communities. While the relations between the indigenous tribals and settler communities have relatively improved, ethnic tensions shifted to the indigenous tribes. This article uses the perceived threat hypothesis and a combination of rational choice theory and interpretivism to explain empirically observed realities in Meghalaya. Emphasis is placed on the post-1992 period, focusing on the emerging ethnic relations between the indigenous tribes of Meghalaya. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Radical Caribbean social thought: Race, class identity and the postcolonial nation
AN  - 1738477462; 201538498
AB  - The Caribbean, that first place of significant European conquest, colonialism, large-scale transportation and varying levels of forced or coerced migration and labour, provided the impetus for many 'race theories' of the 18th and 19th centuries. This article explores the engaged scholarship of radical intellectuals of the English-speaking Caribbean emerging from this racially defined colonial context that emerged over the early to mid-20th century and produced counter-narratives of 'postcolonial' and 'anti-colonial' thought. With a focus on the radical pan-Africanist, socialist and neo-Marxist traditions it locates elements of radical Caribbean social thought within a larger radical global intellectual tradition and as a precursor in many ways to today's critical race theories/studies. It focuses on particular themes and methodologies that characterize this work and writing as well as its regional and international impact. Also, the significance of women's rights and 'gender' issues in this tradition is examined; both by its attention to the situation of women in writing and activism and through the important work of key women in these movements. Finally, the article makes a call for a re-engagement with this earlier radical tradition contributing to what Michael Burawoy refers to as public sociology, i.e. a sociology in dialogue with audiences outside the academy while drawing on the traditions of critical sociology.

T1  - Using the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's 'Irish Immigrant Letters Home' to Teach Nineteenth-Century Irish Immigrant History
AN  - 1684423493; 201518534
AB  - AS ANY FACULTY MEMBER who teaches American immigration history knows well, Irish Catholic famine-era immigrants command enormous attention in both the popular media and in scholarly literature. Popular and documentary films, popular and scholarly histories, as well as a host of memoirs and novels all tell various facets of their immigrant story; the Irish, it seems, are everywhere. Consequently, many students arrive in our classrooms with some understanding-sometimes even what they think is a reasonably comprehensive understanding-of the Irish Catholic immigrant experience. Yet as we, their teachers, quickly discover, their knowledge is often limited and romanticized, having been shaped more by popular and sometimes even fictional sources, as well as the values of a popularized Irish ethnic pride derived from a cultivated American Catholic identity, than by a more nuanced, historically based knowledge of these immigrants and their experiences in Ireland and America. As teachers, then, our first and primary task is to deconstruct the understandings students bring with them and substitute a richer, more complicated picture of this immigrant experience.

T1  - The Costume of Shangri-La: Thoughts on White Privilege, Cultural Appropriation, and Anti-Asian Racism
AN  - 1641424200; 201500264
AB  - This piece poses cultural appropriation as an undertheorized aspect of white privilege in White Privilege Studies. By way of narrative exploration, it asserts that a paucity of scholarship on Orientalism and anti-Asian racism has created a gap in White Privilege Studies that curbs its radical transformative potential. It argues for the value of a structural and historically focused lens for understanding the issue of cultural appropriation, and extends questions of culture and race relations beyond the borders of the United States. It also explores the complex ways that interracial and transnational relationships can influence white racial identity, and illustrates the disruptive potential that queer interracial relationships can offer to dominant historical patterns of white behavior.

T1  - Affect and the sociology of race: A program for critical inquiry
AN  - 1520342870; 201413527
AB  - Theorizing the centrality of race remains a key issue within the social sciences. However, an examination of four programs that dominate critical inquiry, particularly in the US context -- Racial Formation Theory; Systemic Racism; Color-Blind Racism; and Critical Race Theory -- reveal two key problems: a reductivist account of the role of culture in the production of race and racism and the essentializing of the political identity of racial Others. This article, then, considers a different paradigm for the study of race -- an affective program. Two components of an affective program identified in this article are: (a) a more dynamic account of culture, opening up the realm of the discursive to more than just signification and representation, but also expression; and (b) locating the possibilities of racial politics as matters of racialized and anti-racist practices rather than matters of racial identity.

T1  - Migrating race: migration and racial identification among Puerto Ricans
AN  - 1520336692; 201413541
AB  - The pattern of racial identification among Puerto Ricans is not uniform. It varies depending on where they live. Most identify as white, but more do so in Puerto Rico than in the USA. This paper addresses the impact that living alternatively in the USA and in Puerto Rico has on racial identification among Puerto Ricans. Using Public Use Microdata Sample data from the American Community Survey and the Puerto Rico Community Survey 2006-2008, I find that while there is no single pattern of impact, those more grounded on the island's racial system are more likely to identify as white in the USA, while those less grounded in Puerto Rico are more likely to identify as multiracial or by another racial descriptor. On their return to the island, they revert to the prevalent pattern of racial identification, while still exhibiting effects of their sojourn on their racial identity.

T1  - Talking 'race' through 1 Malaysia in editorials: A critical discourse analysis
AN  - 1738477558; 201538505
AB  - This study focuses on the discussion of 1 Malaysia, Malaysia's latest national blueprint for unity and identity, in the New Straits Times (NST), Malaysia's oldest and state-owned English language print media. We examine the means by which NST has constructed the latest political venture in forging a national identity, while negotiating the various challenges to such an undertaking. Employing the critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach, we look at distinctive nomination and predication patterns as well as the occurrence of high and low factuality. This is conducted primarily through an analysis of social actors, their predication and modality to show how these contribute to the construction of the 1 Malaysia ideology. Findings suggest that the signifier of 1 Malaysia serves not only as a reference point for discussing subjects of concern to reformists, but also provides opportunities for the newspaper to hold institutions to account.

T1  - Education, Employment, and Income Polarization among Aboriginal Men and Women in Canada
AN  - 1629331179; 201440933
AB  - Aboriginal women and men (aged 25-44) have made substantial gains in education, employment, and income. Higher levels of education, full-time employment, and earned income allowed some Indian, Metis, and Inuit men and women to close the gaps between themselves and their non-Aboriginal counterparts. On the other hand, at the lower end of the ladder, conditions have stagnated or deteriorated. As a result, social inequality is increasing substantially within Indian and Inuit populations polarization is less marked among the Metis-the least disadvantaged among Aboriginals. Although women surpass men in educational attainment, a gender gap in income persists among Indian and Metis-but not Inuit-peoples. In the aggregate, Aboriginal people remain in the lowest ranks in terms of most socioeconomic indicators. However, individuals from each of the Aboriginal identity groups have made impressive gains in higher education, full-time employment, and earned income-effectively leaving those on the bottom rungs of the ladder farther behind Whereas people who identify as North American Indian on the census are the most disadvantaged among Aboriginals, Indian women fare worse than men. On the lowest rung of the ladder are Indian women, who suffer multiple jeopardy based on race, ethnicity (Aboriginal identity), and gender. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Ethno-Cultural Organizations in Immigrant Integration: A Case Study of the Bulgarian Society in Western Canada
AN  - 1629331116; 201440952
AB  - A major debate in international migration research is focused around the question of whether immigrants receive benefits from their attachment to ethnic organizations. This study aims to make a contribution to this debate by exploring the nature, goals and functions of an ethno-cultural organization in a Western Canadian city-the Bulgarian Society. Drawing from theoretical concepts regarding ethnic organization as a source of social capital, this research examines the economic, socio-cultural experience and ethnic attachments of members/non-members of an ethnic organization, how they interact with the organization, and their perception of how it affected their integration into Canadian society. Utilizing semi-structured face to face interviews, the results shed light on how immigrants use ethno-cultural organizations to nurture and express their identity and values, gain social acceptance, achieve their personal goals and affect their sense of belonging. The present research also addresses the role and function of small ethnic communities such as Bulgarians in an urban setting. The findings suggest that Bulgarians from recent waves of immigration are experiencing a period of adaptation as members or non-members of the ethnic society. They integrate at all levels in a parallel fashion, being valuable actors on both social and economic stages, however, their sense of ethnic collectivity and organizational belonging is more symbolic and emotional. Members and non-members acknowledge the Society as a source of networking and cultural retention rather than as a main factor for their integration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - SOUTH AFRICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' LIFE SATISFACTION AND PERCEPTIONS OF AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS
AN  - 1622296902; 201438268
AB  - In recent years, South Africa has experienced xenophobic violence directed against African immigrants. The aim in this study was to investigate the life satisfaction and perceptions of African immigrants among black South African university students. Undergraduate psychology students (192 women and 63 men) completed the Temporal Satisfaction With Life Scale and Southern African Migration Programme Survey Questionnaire. The results supported the expectation of the students' high levels of life satisfaction and favorable perceptions of African immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Anyone Can Be an Illegal': Color-Blind Ideology and Maintaining Latino/Citizen Borders
AN  - 1512220922; 201408763
AB  - Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance, which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to include nonwhite immigrants.

T1  - Restricting the scope of justice to justify discrimination: The role played by justice perceptions in discrimination against immigrants
AN  - 1512219689; 201408675
AB  - In this research, we have analysed the role played by the scope of justice and belief in a just world (BJW) in discrimination against immigrants. In Study 1 (n = 185), we found that the relationship between prejudice and discrimination is mediated by a restricted view of the scope of justice. In addition, the results also showed that this mediation is moderated by BJW insofar as the mediation occurred in participants with a high level of BJW but not in participants with a low level of BJW. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally tested our prediction that the legitimising role played by the scope of justice is guided by a justice motive such as BJW. In both studies, the results showed a greater degree of discrimination against immigrants when a restricted scope of justice was considered but only when the BJW was made salient. In sum, these results introduced an innovation into the literature on the legitimation of social inequalities by demonstrating the relevant role played by the justice perceptions in discrimination against immigrants. .

T1  - 'Mexicans will take the jobs that even blacks won't do': an analysis of blackness, regionalism and invisibility in contemporary Mexico
AN  - 1512219455; 201408824
AB  - Mexico's unique form of mestizaje has successfully excluded Afro-descendants from Mexican national imaginary for decades, treating Afro-Mexicans as though they do not exist. However, there is a small population of Afro-Mexicans that reside primarily in Mexico's two coastal regions. So how do coastal Mexicans understand blackness? Using ethnographic and interview data, I show that while Mexico as a nation does not have systemic racial ideologies that incorporate blackness, distinct local ideas of blackness do exist within rural coastal Mexico, and are constructed, in part, through this national invisibility. Moreover, I argue that these local understandings are subject to transnational processes as Afro-Mexican immigration to the USA grows. The racial meanings produced among Afro-Mexican migrants in the USA circulate back to Mexico and reshape racial identities. This process highlights both the persisting role of race and mestizaje in constructing Mexican national identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Narrative encounters and changing perceptions of others
AN  - 1448995606; 201342713
AB  - Although each of the contributions to this issue of Peace and Conflict were submitted to the journal's editorial office independently, they all focus on a set of related topics -- dialogue, narrative, empathy, and perspective taking -- in the context of prejudice, stress, trauma, and heightened or intransigent conflict. They offer insight into peace and conflict that is broad in scope and attentive to detail. We see commonality in all of the articles in this issue as each examines what it means to encounter new knowledge, experiences, or social issues. By bringing together diverse theories, methods, and contexts -- micro and macro, historical and contemporary -- and applying them to key impediments to peace in today's world, this issue makes a valuable contribution to peace psychology and conflict studies. We are most appreciative of the many authors and reviewers who have contributed their research and expertise to this issue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Implications of free will beliefs for basic theory and societal benefit: Critique and implications for social psychology
AN  - 1438556372; 201340144
AB  - Greater belief in free will is associated with greater empathy towards the working poor, support for social mobility, greater desire for socio-economic equality, and less belief that poor people are fated to live in poverty. We found no sign that belief in free will led to prejudice or discrimination against poor people or undercut justice. These findings from an online survey flatly contradict the claims made by James Miles (2013). Belief in a just world did produce many of the patterns Miles attributed to belief in free will. We also question the reasoning and the strength of the purported evidence in his article, and we recommend that future writers on the topic should cultivate cautious, open-minded consideration of competing views. Miles' article is a useful reminder that to some writers, the topic of free will elicits strong emotional reactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Why do white people have thin lips?' Google and the perpetuation of stereotypes via auto-complete search forms
AN  - 1438549140; 201340177
AB  - This study highlights how the auto-complete search algorithm offered by the search tool Google can produce suggested terms which could be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic. Google was interrogated by entering different combinations of question words and identity terms such as 'why are blacks...' in order to elicit auto-completed questions. Two thousand, six hundred and ninety questions were elicited and then categorised according to the qualities they referenced. Certain identity groups were found to attract particular stereotypes or qualities. For example, Muslims and Jewish people were linked to questions about aspects of their appearance or behaviour, while white people were linked to questions about their sexual attitudes. Gay and black identities appeared to attract higher numbers of questions that were negatively stereotyping. The article concludes by questioning the extent to which such algorithms inadvertently help to perpetuate negative stereotypes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Coping with HIV Related Stigma and Well-Being
AN  - 1448994997; 201342730
AB  - The goal of this study was to analyze the relationships to be found among stigma perception, active and avoidant coping strategies, and subjective and psychological well-being in a sample of 133 people with HIV. The results showed that stigma perception and avoidant coping strategies (venting, self-blame, denial, behavioural disengagement and substance use) were positively associated, whereas, both stigma perception and avoidant coping were negatively associated with different measures of well-being (affect balance, self-acceptance and environmental mastery). These negative relationships between stigma perception and the three well-being measures were mediated by the use of avoidant coping strategies. Results suggest that psychosocial intervention programs for people who report psychological distress arising from prejudice must be aimed at developing appropriate ways to deal with this prejudice. Intervention programs should also include strategies to directly increase well-being since from a positive psychology viewpoint certain interventions have been shown to do so, and HIV research has also shown that well-being is associated with lower mortality rates.

I examine the attempts of Neolog Hungarian Jews to re-invent themselves in the racially infused language of Hungarian society by histories of the Orient that demonstrated a racial compatibility. The article argues that in order to provide a foundation for their acceptance into Hungarian society Neolog Hungarian Jews engaged in Oriental Studies to argue that a separate Jewish race did not exist. The paper analyses the writings of Neolog intellectuals, based on archival materials, such as correspondence, rare documents, and journal articles from the Orszagos Szecsenyi Library and the Magyar Tudomanyos Akademia Library in Budapest, Hungary (which have been translated into English for the first time). Jewish race theories based on Orientalism are particular to Hungary but were not discussed because the experience of Jews in Vienna and Prague was considered to be the norm throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In order to have a fuller exposure to the Central European Jewish experience of the past we need to address the distinct Hungarian Jewish situation. This paper attempts to fill this void.

T1  - Prototypical Psychological Africanity (Racial Identity) Profiles And Orientations For Social Engineering Of African Descent People
AN  - 1429631095; 201335659
AB  - It is asserted within the context of Frantz Fanon's call to set afoot a new person of African descent that for social, cultural, and economic development of the African-U.S. population, perhaps Africans worldwide, racial identity must be changed to "psychological Africanity", an orientation to sustain, develop, extend, and defend African life and culture as a priority. Desirable and undesirable profiles and orientations of psychological Africanity (also called racial identity and African personality) based on Azibo's (2006a) rudimentary psychological Africanity framework were investigated for this purpose. Five conceptual profiles and three empirically-derived psychological Africanity orientation groups labeled correct, diffused, and incorrect were articulated and operationalized. Hypothesized relationships with a measure approximating pure psychological Africanity (meaning identification as African descent as if there had been no Eurasian disruption of African civilizations) and huge amounts of explained variance were found in two studies for both profile conceptualizations and the orientations. Results confirm the desirable profiles and the correct orientation group stand the best chance of bringing the psycho-cultural change necessary for African-U.S. development.

T1  - Race, ethnicity and religion: emerging policies in Britain
AN  - 1551002823; 201429003
AB  - Britain's integration model is recurrently held up as the epitome of the multiculturalist model in Europe. Moreover, it tends to be presented as though it was intrinsic to British society and had always existed. This is not the case. In reality the model has passed through successive phases of an ongoing evolution and was constructed through the interaction between British society and the ethnic minorities of immigrant origin who settled in Britain after the Second World War. After a brief period of assimilationism, a race relations paradigm was formulated, followed by the establishment of a multicultural policy. It is often assumed that multicultural policy is a simple continuation of a race relations approach under another name. But Joly argues that this is inaccurate and that each corresponds to distinct policy parameters and to different stages. Moreover, this was not the end of the line. The multiculturalist model has come under a barrage of criticism emanating from various sources and different viewpoints. Nevertheless, Joly maintains that it has not been eliminated but has metamorphosed into a Muslim paradigm. Her paper explores the different stages of integration policies directed at immigrants and how those were constructed. The paradigms were developed through the categorization of immigrants by the majority and the mobilization of immigrants as a result of their interaction with British society. The paper draws the contours of each of these stages, examines the fault lines and areas of tension, and explores the underpinnings of the evolution. It argues that policies were forged through and beyond discourses largely by the immigrants themselves. In the main it can be posited that the process started with action that began at local level at the initiative of the immigrants and subsequently progressed to the national level. This prompted responses and funding programmes from central government. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Immigration, Rituals and Transitoriness in the Mediterranean Island of Malta
AN  - 1551000398; 201428951
AB  - In contemporary Malta, sub-Saharan 'boat' immigrants are imagined and represented as transients and sojourners rather than as settlers. The dynamics of these processes include a set of stylised rituals and spectacles of departure and arrival, as well as containment practices linked to sojourn. The former are associated with the notion of islandness and its corollary, borders; the latter may be thought of as a kind of transformation of domestic space into a vulnerable and partially invisible one. The upshot is that, irrespective of its empirical 'truth' value, transience is a product actively and agentively produced by the state and other actors in response to a perceived threat from immigration.

T1  - Race-Ethnic Differences in Sexual Health Knowledge
AN  - 1494750578; 201402042
AB  - Despite extensive research examining the correlates of unintended fertility, it remains a puzzle as to why racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to experience an unintended birth than non-Hispanic whites. This paper focuses on sexual literacy, a potential precursor of unintended fertility. Analyses use a unique dataset of unmarried young adults aged 18-29, the 2009 Survey of Unmarried Young Adults' Contraceptive Knowledge and Practices, to examine beliefs regarding pregnancy risks, pregnancy fatalism, and contraceptive side effects. At the bivariate level, foreign-born Hispanics hold more erroneous beliefs about the risk of pregnancy than other groups, and non-Hispanic blacks are more likely to believe in contraceptive side effects than non-Hispanic whites. Both foreign-born Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to hold a fatalistic view toward pregnancy. Race-ethnic differences are attenuated for pregnancy misperceptions and fatalism in multivariate models controlling for sources of health information, sexual and fertility experiences, and sociodemographic characteristics. However, non-Hispanic blacks remain more likely than non-Hispanic whites to believe there is a high chance of reduced sexual desire and serious health consequences when using hormonal contraceptives. These differences may contribute to race-ethnic variation in contraceptive use and, ultimately, unintended fertility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Implicit measures of the stereotype content associated with disability
AN  - 1373428008; 201328453
AB  - The present research aimed to show that the mixed stereotype content of persons with disability observed at an explicit level does not manifest itself using implicit measures. Two experimental studies were conducted to analyse the stereotype content of persons with a disability at the implicit level. The procedure used in this study was the concept priming paradigm. Furthermore, Study 2 also included an explicit measure. Results show important discrepancies between implicit and explicit measures. At an explicit level, previous work supporting the mixed stereotype content of persons with disability was replicated: participants judged these persons as warmer but less competent than persons without a disability. At an implicit level, a quite different pattern of results emerged: persons with a disability were associated not only with less competence than persons without disability, but also with less warmth. These findings suggest that the mixed pattern between warmth and competence generally observed at an explicit level may be based on societal pressures against prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Psychosocial Factors of Migration: Adaptation and Application of the Health Belief Model
AN  - 1266144810; 201300377
AB  - Psychosocial factors influencing behaviour play a central role in health research but seem under-explored in migration research. This is unfortunate because these factors, which include knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, intentions and personality traits, provide essential and potentially effective handles for linking migration and migrant-integration policies. We demonstrate that the health belief model (HBM) conceptualization of behavioural intentions contributes constructs that can further our understanding of migration intentions, thereby broadening the foundations for migration policies. We adapt the HBM to migration behaviour and then test it empirically by using survey data on international migration from West Africa and the Mediterranean region to the European Union. The results confirm that indicators of "perceived threat to living conditions", "perceived benefits" and "perceived barriers to migration", "cues to action" and "self-efficacy" contribute considerably to the explanation of migration intentions. We conclude that psychosocial factors deserve greater prominence in migration theories and empirical research, and we recommend that migration surveys consider this framework to identify relevant indicators of psychosocial factors of international migration and develop appropriate survey questions to measure them.

T1  - Show Me Your Papers! Obama's Birth and the Whiteness of Belonging
AN  - 1125217577; 201240424
AB  - In the wake of Barack Obama's 2009 ascension to the White House, stories questioning his citizenship slowly trickled into the mainstream. By 2011, "Birtherism"-the belief that Obama is constitutionally disqualified from holding Presidential office-was a principle aspect of public discourse. Through an analysis of online comments in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, I analyze how dominant understandings of citizenship, race, class, and civil rights structure public navigation of "Birther" claims. I find the presence of several "narratives of belonging"-shared stories that people socially construct to account for who they are, how the world works, and where different people belong. These narratives reveal the sustained conflation of citizenship with an ideal or "hegemonic" form of white racial identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Photographing Handsworth: photography, meaning and identity in a British inner city
AN  - 1283644041; 201303284
AB  - 'If you say "Handsworth",' the novelist Salman Rushdie remarked in 1986, 'what do you see? Most people would see fire, riots, looted shops ... and helmeted cops ... a front page story.' In the 1980s, 'front page' images of violence and disorder had come to define areas of black settlement such as Handsworth. However, for both Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, photography has the potential of unearthing alternative histories of black people in Britain. Connell explores how this might work in practice by taking Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, as its case study. Following the Handsworth riots in 1985, a photograph of the 'black bomber' appeared on the front page of every national tabloid newspaper, and Handsworth became conceptualized by the media as 'Frontline Britain'. At the same time, there are numerous examples of photographs from within Handsworth that attempt to present a different view of the community: images taken at high-street portraiture studios, community photography projects and the documentary work of the professional photographers Vanley Burke and Pogus Caesar. What such images offer the historian, it will be shown, is not clear cut. Photographs from within Handsworth are suggestive of possible themes in any alternative history of race in Britain, particularly in their emphasis on everyday life. However, Connell shows that it is also necessary to understand what is often the unacknowledged politics behind these images, something that makes them-in differing ways-as problematic as the stereotypical narratives presented on the front pages of tabloid newspapers.

T1  - Relatively Socially Acceptable Prejudice Within and Between Societies
AN  - 1023026891; 201223747
AB  - Two studies investigated the relative social acceptability of certain prejudices within a society (Study 1) and between societies (Study 2), using (less) internal motivation to control prejudice as an indicator of social acceptability. In Study 1, White British participants reported less internal motivation to control prejudice against people with schizophrenia than against Black people. In Study 2, Jamaican participants reported less internal motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice than did either British participants or American participants. Other differences in motivation to control prejudice were smaller, absent, or at odds with this difference, indicating that differences in motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice were not solely due to cultural differences concerning motivation to control prejudice in general. Results are discussed in terms of novel findings, relevance to the literature and possible future research. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudice Against Muslim Australians: The Role of Values, Gender and Consensus
AN  - 1023026675; 201223735
AB  - Data from an Australian community survey (n = 189) examining the predictors of prejudice against Muslim Australians were analysed. Using thematic analysis, we investigated the specific values our participants reported regarding their perceptions of Muslim Australians and Islam. We then investigated the relationship between prejudice against Muslim Australians, the most important value priorities given by our participants, and other prejudice-related variables. After entry into a regression analysis, the participants high in prejudice were found to be significantly more likely to have lower educational levels and more right-wing views. They were also significantly more likely to report high levels of national attitudes (i.e. stronger identification with Australian identity), concern about gender equality within the Muslim community, less concern about equality generally and report that Muslims were not conforming to Australian values. High prejudiced participants also scored higher in the reporting of negative media-related beliefs, were more likely to perceive higher support in the community for their views than was the case and were more negative towards Muslim men than Muslim women. The implications for anti-prejudice interventions are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Young, Black, and Connected: Facebook Usage Among African American College Students
AN  - 1023025525; 201223895
AB  - This article examines the extent and intensity of Facebook usage among African American college students and investigates their reasons for using Facebook. As expected, 98% of students in the survey had a Facebook account, and a large number of Facebook "friends." Younger users spent significantly more time on Facebook than older ones. Our findings underscore the importance of cultural influence for African American online users. Displaying photographs and personal interests on Facebook signals racial identity among African American college students. Personality traits, such as self-esteem, trust in people, satisfaction with university life, and racial identity, were not significant predictors on the time spent on Facebook.

T1  - Suicidal and Depressive Symptoms in Filipino Home Care Workers in Israel
AN  - 926573533; 22124622
AB  - The study consisted of a cross sectional sample of 178 Filipino home care workers who completed the Paykel Suicide Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Respondents also completed questionnaires about exposure to abuse and perceived social support. Overall, 35% of the sample reported exposure to some type of abuse within their home/work environment. For those reporting low levels of satisfaction with care recipient, higher exposure to major lifetime discrimination was associated with higher SIA, whereas for those reporting high levels of satisfaction with care recipient, there was no relationship between exposure to major lifetime discrimination and SIA. Abuse within the home/work environment was the only predictor of depressive symptoms, with greater abuse being associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms. Filipino home care workers in Israel likely are exposed to moderate levels of abuse and discrimination within the home/work environment as well as within society at large. Because live-in home care workers spend the majority of their time within the home/work environment, their relationship with their care recipients have protective qualities that can serve as a buffer against discrimination. Nevertheless, abusive working conditions within their home/work environment have detrimental effects on their mental health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Secondary transfer effects of interracial contact: The moderating role of social status
AN  - 1622296861; 201438359
AB  - The contact hypothesis asserts that intergroup attitudes can be improved when groups have opportunities to interact with each other. Recent research extending the contact hypothesis suggests that contact with a primary outgroup can decrease bias toward outgroups not directly involved in the interaction, which is known as the secondary transfer effect (STE). The present study contributes to growing research on STEs by investigating effects among Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White undergraduate students (N = 3,098) attending 28 selective colleges and universities. Using hierarchical linear modeling, our results reveal numerous positive STEs among Asian, Black, and Hispanic college students. No significant STEs were observed among White students. Mediated moderation analyses support an attitude generalization mechanism, because STEs were explained by changes in attitudes toward the primary outgroup. This research speaks to equivocal findings in the extant STE literature and highlights directions for future research on social cohesion and bias reduction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Relevance of People's Attitudes Towards Freedom of Expression in a Changing Media Environment
AN  - 1315598833; 201308316
AB  - The article outlines arguments for the relevance of people's attitudes towards freedom of expression: It is a fundamental principle of democracy that if a virtue does not receive support from the population, it will not be anchored in law and its foundation is endangered in the medium term. People's support for free speech is becoming even more influential because authoritative control of internet communication is faced with difficulties. Furthermore, with the development of social media users gain new opportunities to publicly express their opinions attaching even more importance to normative self-regulation. As a matter of fact, these increased opportunities of self-regulation may either enhance or decrease the exercise of expression rights. Thus, citizen's endorsement of free expression is a valuable indicator of the status of freedom of expression in a country. To approach to the subject empirically, the paper systematizes findings on people's attitudes towards free speech: Most people believe in freedom of expression in the abstract. Willingness to apply the right to opposing groups, however, is lower. Perceived threats, confidence in democratic principles, mode of communication, and personality variables influence tolerance of expressions. Finally, a research agenda is put forward to examine appreciation of free expression, its antecedence, and implications. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This study focuses on differences in sense of belonging between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual students. Data from 1,745 secondary school students were collected with an online survey. Step-wise multiple regression analyses was used to investigate the relationship between sexual orientation and sense of school belonging. The results show that sexual orientation has an impact on sense of belonging for girls, but not for boys. Perceived discrimination and LGB friendliness of the school appeared to be important indicators of sense of belonging for all the respondents, irrespective of their sexual orientation.

T1  - Behavioural consequences of imagining intergroup contact with stigmatized outgroups
AN  - 1023028878; 201223706
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an outgroup member would change intergroup behaviour. Participants who had imagined a positive interaction with an outgroup member or an unspecified stranger were told that they were about to take part in a discussion task with an outgroup member. They were taken to a room and asked to set out two chairs ready for the discussion while the experimenter left, ostensibly to find the other participant. The distance between the two chairs was then measured. Undergraduate students who imagined talking to an obese individual (Experiment 1) or a Muslim individual (Experiment 2) placed the chairs significantly closer than those in the control condition. They also reported more positive feelings and beliefs regarding Muslims. These findings highlight an important practical application of imagined contact: preparing people for successful face-to-face contact.

T1  - From Autonomous Areas to Non-Autonomous Areas: The Politics of Korean Minority Migration in Contemporary China
AN  - 1023025711; 201223941
AB  - Since the start of the market reform in 1978, approximately 30 million of China's rural ethnic minority people have moved to China's industrializing coastal cities. This extraordinary migration wave has included in the past twenty years more than 60% of the two million Korean Chinese. How has this migration of Korean Chinese influenced the political and economic power structures in the autonomous areas and the new non-autonomous areas? This article argues that (a) the decrease in the Korean population in established autonomous areas has weakened the minority's autonomous power. The higher level governments of the autonomous areas have pursued more comprehensive and Han-majority-oriented macroeconomic policies-such as the abolition or merger of smaller Korean autonomous areas and the diminution of the political and economic power of larger Korean autonomous areas-rather than minority-protective policies. (b) The increasing Korean population in new migratory areas motivates these minority migrants to establish governmental and non-governmental organizations to further their political representation in their areas of settlement.

T1  - Turf Wars: Local Context and Latino Political Development
AN  - 1018353297; 201212825
AB  - Research demonstrates that competition over resources can have an important influence on minority political behavior. To date, however, the effects of these local conditions on Latino political behavior have gone largely unexamined. Employing a most similar case study design to overcome the lack of data on intragroup attitudes and political behavior nationally, we examine the voting behavior of Cubans and non-Cuban Hispanics in two Florida counties. The group position thesis holds that status inequalities and perceived discrimination yield out-group hostilities that can influence political behavior. In Miami, where Cubans are dominant, we expect non-Cuban Latinos to report greater pan-Latino competition and that anti-Cuban attitudes will influence non-Cuban Hispanic voting. In Tampa, where non-Cuban Latinos live in communities where Cubans are not dominant, we expect lower levels of perceived competition and Cuban-related attitudes to be inconsequential to the vote. The results confirm that power relations in the local arena constitute an important influence on the political behavior of Latino immigrants.

T1  - 'I am a Believer but not a Conformist': Negotiating Claims to being Religious among Syrian Christians and Muslims
AN  - 914766921; 201200126
AB  - Psychologists' attempts to define and measure religion reveal substantial variability, a lack of consensus, cultural variation and differences between religions. A discursive psychology approach can address variability in meanings and the inferential issues that may inform claims to be religious. This paper identifies strategies used by Syrian Muslims and Christians to affirm, reformulate or deny religiousness. The analysis is based on a corpus of data generated through semi-structured interviews with 158 men and women. It shows how some speakers affirm that they are religious and treat this as a non-accountable matter. When asked to describe the basis of being religious, they produced descriptions of their own practices or a set of general criteria. Other speakers denied or modified 'being religious', using an 'x but not y' formulation to reject one meaning (for example, conformist) in favour of another (for example, believer). Some speakers' self-ascriptions were reinforced by characterizing their own views of religion as morals and good behaviour. Thus speakers deploy multiple meanings of religion for different purposes. Moreover their accounts address inferential and interpersonal problems that arise when claiming to be religious: specifically that others may infer extremism or conformity, or prejudice against members of other religions. The implications of these observations for social psychological studies of religion are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Stereotypes as Justifications of Prejudice
AN  - 902085374; 201122138
AB  - Three experiments investigate how stereotypes form as justifications for prejudice. The authors created novel content-free prejudices toward unfamiliar social groups using either subliminal (Experiment 1, N = 79) or supraliminal (Experiment 2, N = 105; Experiment 3, N = 130) affective conditioning and measured the consequent endorsement of stereotypes about the groups. Following the stereotype content model, analyses focused on the extent to which stereotypes connoted warmth or competence. Results from all three experiments revealed effects on the warmth dimension but not on the competence dimension: Groups associated with negative affect were stereotyped as comparatively cold (but not comparatively incompetent). These results provide the first evidence that-in the absence of information, interaction, or history of behavioral discrimination-stereotypes develop to justify prejudice.

T1  - Linguistic intergroup bias tells ingroup/outgroup orientation of bicultural Asian Americans
AN  - 1030866583; 201227963
AB  - Traditional studies of ethnic relations focus on racialization between Whites and Blacks, or ethnic stratification between Whites and people of color. This study aims at broadening conventional studies of interethnic relations to examine racial attitudes among people who have internalized more than one culture -- i.e., the biculturals and multiculturals. Social psychological research suggests that bicultural individuals are capable of switching between two cultural meaning frames depending on contextual demands. Bicultural individuals vary in how well they integrate the two cultural identities internalized in them -- i.e., their bicultural identity integration levels (BII levels). Their BII levels lead to either culturally congruent or culturally incongruent behaviors among bicultural individuals. The underlying assumption of linguistic intergroup bias indicates that people tend to describe more abstractly observed positive ingroup behaviors and negative outgroup behaviors and describe more concretely observed negative ingroup behaviors and positive outgroup behaviors. In this study, bicultural Asian American participants are hypothesized to use language of either higher or lower abstraction to describe actions of positive and negative valence performed by either ethnic Asians or European Americans depending on the cultural priming they received and their BII levels. The demonstrated pattern of ingroup enhancement and outgroup derogation of the bicultural participants point out the perceived ingroup/outgroup orientation of these biculturals towards their coethnics and people of the mainstream culture. Effects of the cultural priming and impact of BII levels are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - MLK Boulevard: Material Forms of Memory and the Social Contestation of Racial Signification
AN  - 919904852; 201201610
AB  - This article examines, from a memory studies perspective, the complex interconnections between memory traces and race signification. Material forms of recollection, I contend, can inextricably be connected to racial identity individually and collectively. Once a public space is dedicated, it connects the visual-factual to the sensual-emotional: a landscape-identity nexus. Drawing from the Martin Luther King, Jr. street renaming debate in Muncie, Indiana, this article analyzes how sites of memory influence individual and social constructions of black commemoration. When the Whitely Neighborhood Association requested to rename Broadway Ave. after Martin Luther King, Jr., a city-wide debate sharply divided those in favor from those against the name change. In turning to the above mentioned case, my aim is to illuminate the means and processes by which memory comprises vigorous sites of commemoration and, at the same time, contentious settings of race negotiation, identification, and signification.

T1  - The Museumization of Migration in Paris and Berlin and Debates on Representation
AN  - 1037881571; 201231136
AB  - In this article, the author takes an ethnographic approach to the museumization of migration in Paris and Berlin by focusing on the French migration museum, the Cite nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration, as well as in various examples in Berlin -- such as neighborhood museums, art institutions and ethnographic museums. By looking at these examples through the perspective of social movements which have taken place in the United States and which unleashed debates around civil rights, the representation of racial/ethnic minorities, knowledge formations and the design of academic curricula, this article explores the ways in which actors engage in representing migration in museums and exhibits. The ethnographic cases show arenas of conflict and interaction between "makers" and "participants," in which the making of representations is contested. At the same time that the topic of "migration" in a museum can be used for a politics of multiculturalism, it can also open up spaces for political interventions "from below." The first part of the article discusses the strategies employed by the Cite nationale to represent migration "from above," showing the internal fractures and the conflicts which emerge when "immigrants" appear as visitors in the museum. The second part of the article shows ethnographic cases in Berlin, focusing on how the body of the "immigrant" as well as "immigrant communities" are used by museum curators as objects of display in neighborhood and ethnographic museums. The third part explores an exhibit in Berlin, which shows how actors of an immigrant association represented themselves and their community in an art institution and in their own terms. The last part compares the exhibits on migration in both cities and describes the political intervention of the Sans Papiers movement, which took the Cite nationale between October 2010 and January 2011 to fight for their legal status from within the museum.

T1  - Prime and prejudice: Co-occurrence in the culture as a source of automatic stereotype priming
AN  - 925712954; 201204051
AB  - It has been argued that stereotype priming (response times are faster for stereotypical word pairs, such as black-poor, than for non-stereotypical word pairs, such as black-balmy) is partially a function of biases in the belief system inherent in the culture. In three priming experiments, we provide direct evidence for this position, showing that stereotype priming effects associated with race, gender, and age can be very well explained through objectively measured associative co-occurrence of prime and target in the culture: (a) once objective associative strength between word pairs is taken into account, stereotype priming effects disappear; (b) the relationship between response time and associative strength is identical for social primes and non-social primes. The correlation between associative-value-controlled stereotype priming and self-report measures of racism, sexism, and ageism is near zero. The racist/sexist/ageist in all of us appears to be (at least partially) a reflection of the surrounding culture. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1125220965; 201240478
AB  - This work presents an overview of the results of a 2003/4 research project funded by the Italian Ministry of Welfare. The goal of the project was to provide some insight into the process of identity construction among children of immigrants in Italy. Being in charge of the Chinese case study, I carried out 8 months of fieldwork among a group of Chinese teenagers in Rome. The results show how the young Chinese in Italy maintain a strong awareness of their ethnic belonging. The Italian environment is perceived as a collection of opportunities: tools that can be exploited to pursue an ideal of young Chinese overseas at one time deeply attached to the culture of origin but also anti-traditional.

AN  - 1125216978; 201240340
AB  - This paper presents a conversation between second-generation Eritreans in Milan. The focus is cast on how the youths speak about themselves and their experiences living in Milan, going to Eritrea, their transnational family and their daily life between different realities. Their words show that belonging is not clear cut, and neither are identities. Blackness, Africanness, Italianness, Eritreanness, race and culture, closed and opened mentality, and civilized versus uncivilized behaviours are the topics they speak about in the group conversation, in which they open the debate as to how they play with existing definitions of the self and how they reproduce them.

T1  - Pretending to Be "Postracial": The Spectacularization of Race in Reality TV's Survivor
AN  - 907924300; 201124659
AB  - While race is usually an implicit discourse in reality television, making it an explicit discourse seems to have little effect on challenging the prevailing representations of race in prime-time television. This research demonstrates how Survivor's "race wars" season attempted to reinforce a "postracial" narrative that race no longer matters in contemporary U.S. society while simultaneously perpetuating the familiar representations that reproduce racial ideology. Using data derived from a systematic content analysis, the author argues that Survivor spectacularized race by (1) using racial logic to explain the success and failure of teams as well as the failure of individuals to survive within their teams, (2) essentializing people of color's racial identity as biologically and culturally bound while simultaneously making whiteness invisible and normal, and (3) promoting color-blind and postracial assertions that contradicted the clear salience of race in shaping contestants' "survival." The author considers what this explicit racialization of the program reveals about the potential for-and pitfalls of-addressing race in reality television.

T1  - Seeing the Unseen: Attention to Daily Encounters With Sexism as Way to Reduce Sexist Beliefs
AN  - 1125223497; 201243544
AB  - Three experiments were conducted in the United States and Germany to test whether women and men endorse sexist beliefs because they are unaware of the prevalence of different types of sexism in their personal lives. Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals "to see the unseen." Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that men's endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce women's versus men's endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Environmental Determinants of Racial Attitudes Redux: The Critical Decisions Related to Operationalizing Context
AN  - 896165072; 201120189
AB  - Although scholars have long been interested in how context shapes racial attitudes, research in this area has fallen short of a consensus. Instead, the results span a wide range, with some studies finding that racial understanding is promoted by intergroup contact whereas others claim that racial and ethnic outgroups are perceived as a threat to economic and political interests. These varying results arise from research rooted in different conceptualizations of context. Our analysis is unique in the attention we pay to the measure of context for our particular data set. Employing a sociodemographic definition of neighborhood social context, we find that contextual socioeconomic status plays a critical role in mediating the effects of intergroup contact on racial attitudes. These contacts are more likely to produce racial harmony in high-status neighborhoods than in neighborhoods marked by low income and low levels of education.

T1  - National identity and money: Czech and Slovak Lands 1918-2008
AN  - 875716330; 201115677
AB  - An expanding literature on money and identity is built around the assumption that political elites deliberately use currency design to foster national identities. However, the empirical evidence in favor of this assumption has been fragmentary. Drawing on detailed primary sources we demonstrate nationalist intentions of political elites involved in currency design. We also examine how political elites use banknotes as official pronouncements on who is and who is not part of the nation and what the official attitude toward foreigners is. By tracing changes in the inclusive and exclusive messages directed at an intra-state or international audience we document that there is no connection between ingroup (national) love and outgroup (foreigners, minorities, opposition) hate. The amount of exclusive messages to outgroups culminated in conditions of perceived threat when political leaders tried to mobilize pre-existing identities to secure or maintain political power. In contrast, the officials deliberately tried to broaden ingroup boundaries in order to build international communities. Finally, we document that in the case of limited support for the new conception of identity, officials tried to depict the old and the new identity as complementary, embedding the new identity in existing discourses.

T1  - The Impact of Intersecting Dimensions of Inequality and Identity on the Racial Status of Eastern African Immigrants
AN  - 875715932; 201115295
AB  - In this article, we examine how immigrants from eastern Africa to the Minneapolis and St. Paul metropolitan area understand and navigate the U.S. color line and its implications for nonwhites. Although these immigrants are subject to constraints based on their racial status as black, they mobilize other intersecting aspects of their identities to manipulate racial classifications in the hopes of attaining upward mobility in the United States, even when doing so creates other social costs for them. Eastern African immigrants draw on their ethnicity and, among Muslim immigrants, their religion to differentiate themselves from African Americans, who occupy the lowest position in the U.S. racial hierarchy. In challenging their categorization as racially black and seeking to move up the racial hierarchy, Eastern African immigrants refine the color line to distinguish between African-American blacks and non-African-American blacks.

T1  - Muslim American/American Muslim Identity: Authoring Self in Post-9/11 America
AN  - 1081861804; 201235160
AB  - This paper examines the proposition that Muslim American identity, whether as individual or group identity, is 'forged' and 'forced' by the American experience that brings together immigrant and American-born Muslims from diverse cultural backgrounds and disparate understandings of Islam. It is here that the histories of the 'Muslim world' and the 'West', nationalism, inter-generational struggles, and the politics of race/ethnicity, gender, and class come into contact. American Muslim becomes part of a discursive contact zone where America and Islam are debated and defined. This paper analyzes how self-image and (re)presentations in this contact zone are contested and constructed by a group of Muslims in Phoenix, Arizona. Specifically, it addresses the following questions: What does 'American Muslim'/'Muslim American' mean? What do such labels conceal or reveal about the convergence of history, politics, national identity, and Muslims' multi-factorial diversity? How does life as a Muslim in Arizona differ from what it was on September 10th, 2001? Data gathered from this ethnographic project reveal three emerging themes. (1) Muslims in Phoenix perceive that the Islam practiced in America is 'more authentic' than that practiced in Muslim-majority countries. (2) They fear that their religious faith is under attack and their loyalty to America is under suspicion. (3) The meaning of the American Muslim /Muslim American label has not yet crystallized.

T1  - Racetalk and Sport: The Color Consciousness of Contemporary Discourse on Basketball
AN  - 1037878117; 201231012
AB  - This article explores how a sample of college students discursively negotiated perceptions of race and ability in the context of mediated sport. A majority of respondents expressed acceptance of a link between racial identity and sport-specific skills. However, rather than articulate this notion overtly and directly, rhetorical strategies, such as disclaimers and coded language, were used. We analyze these responses as a form of "racetalk" (Bonilla-Silva and Forman 2000) to more specifically unpack the significance of discourse within the post-Civil Rights Movement era. Although the language used to discuss race in this sample, like the contemporary era more generally, appears colorblind and progressive on the surface, it is undergirded by a distinct form of color consciousness.

AB  - Past research studies have pointed to how such adverse social conditions have led to the existence of lower rates of social satisfaction and identification with campus for Black college students at predominantly White student colleges. Research shows that access to Black student associations provide social networks that a) encouraged greater interaction with staff and faculty outside of the classroom; b) validated their on-campus experiences; c) promoted strong racial/ethnic attitudes; d) allowed for more access to student support services; e) strengthened identity development and their pursuit of a social justice agenda.

T1  - Bridging Inequality from Both Sides Now
AN  - 856403302; 201106773
AB  - In this article the authors expound upon the insight emanating from the conference organized by Gary Alan Fine and Alice Eagly re the sociological social psychology of inequality, and its structure in society, symbolic interactionism, and processes carried therein. The authors also discuss the identity factor more generally; and highlight the psychology of power relations, and the sociology re the theories of power and inequality, and references through Cook, Rice, and Molm. Then, from this standpoint the authors analyze the inequalities in exchange outcomes, and the role of affect and emotion in exchange processes, before delving into the links to psychology, and overview provided by Kelley et al. Next, the authors look at the subtleties and prejudices of psychological social psychology, and the linkages to sociology's task of integrating inequalities, and conclude with a further analysis and the implications of this bridging of the behavioral sciences.

T1  - 1.5 generation Asian migrants and intergenerational transnationalism: Thoughts and challenges from New Zealand
AN  - 856402858; 201106840
AB  - This article analyses New Zealand's post-1987 immigration patterns, specifically the arrival of East Asian professionals and their families, and their impact on the demographic and cultural composition of New Zealand society. The discussion addresses a specific and under-theorised category of migrants: school-aged children who migrate with their parents, identified as the '1.5 generation'. Focusing on the unique position and attributes of the 1.5 generation, it is posited that New Zealand's new intergenerational transmigrant communities seriously challenge conventional attempts to explain - and manage - migrant settlement and incorporation into host societies.

T1  - Adoptee Aesthetics: A Gendered Discourse
AN  - 1018358599; 201212877
AB  - The present article seeks to explore how aesthetic discourses by adoptee artists from South Korea can be said to place the adoptee figure at the intersection between race and gender. By looking at how the adopted self uses art as a site in which to negotiate the question of identity formation, I hope to make apparent the constructive relation between adoptee aesthetic discourse, gender, and race. The analysis thus intends to challenge our notions of identity, gender, and self, precisely by looking at how discourse is performed in order to transform and, eventually, engender our selves.

T1  - MULTICULTURAL CITIZENSHIP AND MUSLIM IDENTITY POLITICS
AN  - 758122939; 201057022
AB  - I offer a rebuttal of the view, now common among the political classes in Western Europe, that Muslim assertiveness is incompatible with the universalism of liberal democratic citizenship. I do so by sketching a view of multicultural citizenship in which respect for difference is grounded in universalist values. My conception of political multiculturalism is based on the ideas of 'difference', 'multi' and a double conception of equality. Multiculturalism seeks the goal of positive difference and the means to achieve it, which crucially involve the appreciation of the fact of multiplicity and groupness, the building of group pride among those marked by negative difference, and political engagement with the sources of negatitivity and racism. While the focus is not on anything so narrow as normally understood by 'culture', and multicultural equality cannot be achieved without other forms of equality, such as those relating to socioeconomic opportunities, its distinctive feature is about the inclusion into and the making of a shared public space in terms of equality of respect as well as equal dignity. I marry this conception of multiculturalism to a vision of citizenship that is not confined to the state but dispersed across society, compatible with the multiple forms of contemporary groupness and sustained through dialogue, plural forms of representation that do not take one group as the model to whom all others have to conform and new, reformed national identities. Citizenship consists of a framework of rights and practices of participation, but also discourses and symbols of belonging, ways of imagining and remaking ourselves as a country and expressing our sense of commonalities, as well as differences in ways in which these identities qualify each other and create inclusive public spaces. I show in some detail that some British Muslims' identity debates have precisely this character. Ideological and violent extremism is indeed undermining the conditions and hopes for multiculturalism, but this extremism has nothing to do with multiculturalism and is coming into the domestic arena from the international.

T1  - Knowing who likes who: The early developmental basis of coalition understanding
AN  - 743067073; 201043114
AB  - Group biases based on broad category membership appear early in human development. However, like many other primates humans inhabit social worlds also characterised by small groups of social coalitions which are not demarcated by visible signs or social markers. A critical cognitive challenge for a young child is thus how to extract information concerning coalition structure when coalitions are dynamic and may lack stable and outwardly visible cues to membership. Therefore, the ability to decode behavioural cues of affiliations present in everyday social interactions between individuals would have conferred powerful selective advantages during our evolution. This would suggest that such an ability may emerge early in life, however, little research has investigated the developmental origins of such processing. The present paper will review recent empirical research which indicates that in the first 2 years of life infants achieve a host of social-cognitive abilities that make them well adapted to processing coalition-affiliations of others. We suggest that such an approach can be applied to better understand the origins of intergroup attitudes and biases. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - When personal identities confirm versus conflict with group identities: Evidence from an intergroup paradigm
AN  - 743065720; 201043110
AB  - This study provides an experimental investigation of the consequences of conflict between children's personal identities and experimentally manipulated group identities. Elementary-school-aged children (N = 82, ages 5-11) attending a summer school program rated their own academic and athletic abilities and were then randomly assigned to one of two novel groups. Children's views of the academic and athletic skills of the novel groups were assessed both before and after information about the groups' academic and athletic skills was manipulated via posters placed in their classrooms. Following the manipulation, children's self-views, ingroup identification, and intergroup attitudes were assessed. Results indicated that (a) in the absence of information about the novel groups, children projected their personal identities onto their ingroup identities, (b) children maintained their ingroup identities in the face of new information that should have altered their ingroup identities, and (c) more positive personal identities predicted ingroup bias, which in turn predicted happiness with one's ingroup membership. The latter finding suggests that a tendency for children to generalize from their idiosyncratic positive self-views, rather than an indiscriminate desire for self-enhancement or positivity, may be responsible for ingroup bias.

T1  - Leavers and stayers discuss returning home: Internet discourses on migration in the context of the post-communist transformation
AN  - 754041808; 201053319
AB  - There is a significant difference between previous waves of Polish migrants and the massive outflow of people from Poland after the EU expansion. Information technologies enable post-accession migrants to participate actively in an ongoing dialogue with those who stayed in the home country about, among others, various social issues related to the process of the post-communist transformation. This paper discusses an electronic newspaper forum as an example of transnational space of participation in a recreated civil society. Recently there has been an on-going debate in the Polish media about a possible return of the post-04 migrants. Newspapers and magazines emphasise the economic (very strong Polish currency) as well as the political arguments (change of a government for the more liberal one) in order to explain that a mass return might happen. Both migrants and 'non-migrants' make comments on the issues and they post their views on Internet fora of a number of e-papers. Anchoring the study in narrative and discourse analyses, I shall describe topics and linguistic forms of the participants' entries to the fora. I shall also comment on the interactional function of the selected data. In doing so I hope to shed light on the role of such Internet sites as translocal platforms of a new form of involvement in the public sphere. The data come from approximately 500 entries on an Internet forum triggered by newspaper reports and articles in the electronic version of the Gazeta Wyborcza between January and March 2008.

T1  - Culturelessness and Culture Shock: An American-Asian Experience
AN  - 852898422; 201103198
AB  - Even though I identify myself as an American Asian, I struggle with racial issues regarding my adoption. Throughout my childhood and into my adulthood I noticed how popular transnational adoption is, and how common the white American parents and Asian baby combination is today. I wholeheartedly love my adoptive parents but I live with the constant feeling of abandonment. It is a topic that I do not discuss with my friends and family; it is rather taboo and makes most people feel uncomfortable because they cannot relate to me, but then, who do I have to relate to? It seems that society and other people choose to define you by what serves them best, and not by your own merit or personal interests and gains. As I get older my ego identity is beginning to emerge, as I am establishing a "psychological connection between childhood and adulthood" (Muuss 43). Even after coming out of my adolescence and crescendoing into adulthood, however, I remain cultureless, being redefined daily for who and what I am. I am stuck in a constant state of redefinition of self. Who knows what I will be identified as tomorrow. Adapted from the source document.

Due to significant loss of traditional culture, language displacement in favor of Spanish, and a high degree of intermarriage with the Mestizo (non-Indian) population, the Shiwilu were undergoing in the twentieth century a process of ethnic disintegration, being even considered part of the Mestizo peasant population. Surprisingly, an internal movement starting in the 1990s promoted the revalorization of Shiwilu identity and led to their reclassification as a distinct indigenous group. The Native language plays a strategic role; it is the only remaining, tangible cultural element that legitimizes the Shiwilu's claim to being an indigenous people and ensures their recognition as such by others. However, this historical moment coincides with what appears to be the imminent disappearance of Shiwilu. This article provides the necessary context to better understand the importance that the Shiwilu place on their ethnic language, and discusses the challenges faced by those working for its survival. Some of the points raised here may be applicable to other peoples in similar situations, both in Amazonia and beyond. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Civic-secular and ethnic nationalisms as bases of the nation-state: multiculturalism at the crossroads?
AN  - 743043454; 201026610
AB  - The dominant Eurocentric paradigm of the nation and the nation-state was premised on western historical experience that was indigenous to the west but claimed universality for the rest. Many post-colonial countries, particularly those that went through national liberation struggles, like India and China, with multi-ethnic mobilisations, established sovereign states. The nationalist leaders claimed the unity of nationhood for their culturally diverse countries (states), with their millennia-deep civilisational identity, compelling a new discourse on the untenability of the classic Eurocentric paradigm. The second development witnessed the inevitable cultural heterogenisation of the western countries premised on the expansion of the (immigrant) labour market through an ever-enveloping regime of economic liberalisation and world trade. The catharsis of the invasion of cheaper labour from culturally diverse countries, often native-displacing, resulted in western countries attempting to accommodate the emerging changing reality in the context of mono-cultural nations through the concept and policy of multiculturalism. In spite of this, western countries have been witness to intercultural violence, racial discrimination and threats of home grown terrorism. The paper seeks to distinguish between 'pluralism' and 'multiculturalism' and argues for a reformulation of the concept of the nation-state that will have greater applicability across states.
