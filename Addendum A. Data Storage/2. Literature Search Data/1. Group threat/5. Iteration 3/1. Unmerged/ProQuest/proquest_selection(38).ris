T1  - The Day After the Bomb: Well-Being Effects of Terrorist Attacks in Europe
AN  - 2630688647
AB  - We study the non-monetary costs of terrorist attacks in France, Belgium and Germany between 2010 and 2017. Using four waves of the European Social Survey, we find that individual well-being is significantly reduced in the aftermath of a terrorist attack. We explore possible mechanisms, finding that terrorist attacks are negatively correlated with generalized trust, institutional trust, satisfaction with democracy and satisfaction with the government. Terrorist attacks are also found to be positively correlated with negative attitudes towards migrants and perceived discrimination. Contrary to expectations, the negative relationship between terrorism and well-being is less strong for Muslim immigrants. We interpret this finding as an indication that immigrants benefit more than natives from the institutional reaction following terrorist attacks.

T1  - The Rise and Fall of Japan’s New Far Right: How Anti-Korean Discourses Went Mainstream*
AN  - 2557394767
AB  - Why has right-wing activism in Japan, despite its persistence throughout the postwar era, only gained significant traction recently? Focusing on the Zaitokukai, an anti-Korean movement in Japan, this article demonstrates how the new Far Right were able to popularize formerly stigmatized right-wing ideas. The Zaitokukai represents a political group distinct from the traditional right and reflective of new Far Right movements spreading worldwide. In Japan, concerns about the growing influence of South Korea and China in the 1980s as well as the decline of left-wing norms opened up a discursive opportunity for the new Far Right. By framing Korean postcolonial minorities as undeserving recipients of social welfare benefits, the Zaitokukai mobilized perceptions of threat that has continued to powerfully influence public perceptions of Koreans even following the group’s organizational decline. While past research has focused on the new Far Right’s political influence, this article stresses their roles as ideological entrepreneurs.

T1  - The onset of COVID-19, common identity, and intergroup prejudice
AN  - 2556552530
AB  - The research presented here examined the relationship between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, social group identity, intergroup contact, and prejudice. Utilizing a common ingroup identity approach, two datasets, which were composed of data from university students collected via online questionnaires before and after the onset of COVID-19, were combined (N = 511). Participants identified as either one of two subordinate student identities: domestic (i.e. U.S. citizen or permanent resident) or international (i.e. non-U.S. citizen or foreign resident), then reported on the strength of their subordinate and superordinate identity (university identity). Participants also reported on their contact experiences with outgroup members, outgroup stereotypes, and completed a novel intergroup bias task. Results indicated that after the onset of the pandemic, participants more strongly identified with the superordinate group, which predicted greater perceived intergroup contact and lower intergroup bias. Theoretical implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Positive versus negative contact and refugees' intentions to migrate: The mediating role of perceived discrimination, life satisfaction and identification with the host society among Syrian refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2546893089
AB  - Most research on refugee integration focuses on attitudes toward refugees among the members of the host society. Consequently, little is known on refugees' intentions to return home or migrate to another country. The present research investigates whether positive and negative contact with Turks are related to Syrian refugees' migration decisions via perceived discrimination, identification with the host society, and life satisfaction. Using a sample of Syrian adults (N = 285), we found that positive contact with Turks was associated with reduced return intentions via perceived discrimination and identification with the host society and with reduced intentions to migrate from Turkey to the Western countries via life satisfaction. Negative contact was only associated with increased return intentions via perceived discrimination. This study underscores the role of intergroup contact to better understand migration decisions of refugees and potential underlying mechanisms to explain this association.

T1  - Reflection on student drop-out against the backdrop of COVID-19 in the South African Educational context amongst marginalised groups of students
AN  - 2603456395
AB  - The extant literature has previously shown that attitude towards homeownership and pressure from reference groups may significantly affect individual's homeownership intention especially in many western societies. The authors assumed that Nigerian citizens might also have similar experience especially for non-indigenes living and working in states in geo-political zones outside their own ethnic areas. The study surveyed 300 members of Igbo ethnic group residents in Ilorin metropolis. Simple random sampling method was adopted and data was gathered through structured questionnaire. The authors questioned participants about their attitude and intention towards owning personal home in the city. They also asked participants to relate to questions about the perceived easiness to acquire properties for personal use in the city and about the social (families' and relatives') pressure on their homeownership intention. Analytical techniques include simple frequency and percentage distributions, pearson chi-square and independent t-test. Research findings show that while many sampled participants have positive attitude towards homeownership in Ilorin, length of stay in the city, level of education and the perceived control affect homeownership intention among the participants. A surprising result was that subjective norms appear to exert little or no influence on participants' homeownership intention. Hence, the finding demonstrates the interactive nature of social influence/personal norms dimension in homeownership through availability of and access to information and sources of homeownership funding.Alternate abstract:La littérature existante a déjà montré que l'attitude envers l'accession à la propriété et la pression des groupes de référence peuvent affecter de manière significative l'intention d'accession à la propriété d'un individu, en particulier dans de nombreuses sociétés occidentales. Les auteurs ont supposé que les citoyens nigérians pourraient également avoir une expérience similaire, en particulier pour les non-indigènes vivant et travaillant dans des États situés dans des zones géopolitiques en dehors de leurs propres zones ethniques. L'étude a interrogé 300 membres du groupe ethnique Igbo résidant dans la métropole d'Ilorin. Une méthode d'échantillonnage aléatoire simple a été adoptée et les données ont été recueillies au moyen d'un questionnaire structuré. Les auteurs ont interrogé les participants sur leur attitude et leur intention de posséder une maison personnelle dans la ville. Ils ont également demandé aux participants de se rapporter à des questions sur la facilité perçue d'acquérir des propriétés à usage personnel dans la ville et sur la pression sociale (familles et proches) sur leur intention d'accession à la propriété. Les techniques analytiques comprennent des distributions simples de fréquence et de pourcentage, le chi carré de Pearson et le test t indépendant. Les résultats de la recherche montrent que si de nombreux participants échantillonnés ont une attitude positive envers l'accession à la propriété à Ilorin, la durée du séjour dans la ville, le niveau d'éducation et le contrôle perçu affectent l'intention d'accession à la propriété chez les participants. Un résultat surprenant est que les normes subjectives semblent exercer peu ou pas d'influence sur l'intention des participants d'accéder à la propriété. Par conséquent, les résultats démontrent la nature interactive de la dimension influence sociale/normes personnelles dans l'accession à la propriété grâce à la disponibilité et à l'accès à l'information et aux sources de financement pour l'accession à la propriété

T1  - Possibilities for the incorporation of African indigenous procedures and mechanisms of dispute resolution in the administration of criminal justice in Nigeria
AN  - 2462971230
AB  - The pre-colonial African communities were ethnically and culturally diverse with no single dominant ethnic and religious group. Unwritten customary law and procedures were the means by which local communities resolved disputes in the absence of state authority. The laws were based on a common cultural belief and ethical codes that generate a binding regulation on members. Communities adopted this model to impose sanctions against violators and resolve disputes arising among members through various mechanisms. However, the introduction of a new justice system by the colonialists completely interrupted the indigenous system. Today, the indigenous justice system in many African countries is restricted to handling only civil matters through the application of ADR to address some of the challenges facing the contemporary justice system. This paper argues that the customary justice procedure can be adopted in criminal matters as a model that seeks to understand and address the realities of the social causes of crime. The paper concludes that the two systems of justice can complement each other to restore public confidence in the system by catering for the loss suffered by victims rather than focusing on the offenders and offence, bringing justice closer to people without any stress, reintegrating offenders back into the society and ensuring social harmony.

T1  - Making community under shared conditions of insecurity: the negotiation of ethnic borders in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile
AN  - 2430674544
AB  - Multicultural commercial neighbourhoods are key spaces where individuals learn to relate to cultural difference in increasingly diverse cities worldwide. Host countries’ pre-existing social dynamics and environmental conditions mutually shape everyday interactions between people from different ethnonational backgrounds within specific spaces. This article examines two kinds of community-making practices consisting of both intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic exchanges and collaborations, under conditions of shared insecurity in a multicultural commercial neighbourhood in Santiago, Chile. Drawing on ethnic Chinese experiences and responses to crime, we discuss how inhabitants of multicultural sites create more hospitable spaces by building and overcoming boundaries with co-ethnics, other migrants and ‘locals’. Our ethnographic study finds that Chinese residents engaged in what we term ‘strategic ethnic groupism’, which aims to prompt the solidarity of an ‘ethnic-based’ collective in order to politically organise towards long-term solutions. Yet, simultaneously, with other migrants and citizens, the Chinese negotiated everyday intercultural conviviality through creating relations of trust and care to address more immediate insecurity concerns. Discussing both strategies, this article contributes to understanding the productive frictions between ethnicity, community and belonging, under shared conditions of insecurity, in multicultural urban spaces.

T1  - Real Talk About Fake News: Identity Language and Disconnected Networks of the US Public’s “Fake News” Discourse on Twitter
AN  - 2429457246
AB  - This article studies “fake news” beyond the consumption and dissemination of misinformation and disinformation. We uncover how the term “fake news” serves as a discursive device for ordinary citizens to consolidate group identity in everyday political utterances on Twitter. Using computational linguistic and network analyses, we demonstrate that over the period of 2016–2018, there is an uptrend in the use of identity language in US Twitter users’ discussions about “fake news,” manifested by the increased frequency of group pronouns in combination with issues and sentiments that boost one’s ingroup and derogate the outgroup. Furthermore, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that “fake news” is a right-wing term, we uncover two disconnected retweet networks surrounding liberal and conservative opinion leaders. Like-minded individuals selectively amplify ingroup messages to claim the power to define falsehood and make group-serving blame attributions. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and offer new directions for future research on “fake news,” misinformation, and disinformation.

T1  - Construing the Essence: The Effects of Construal Level on Genetic Attributions for Individual and Social Group Differences
AN  - 2082931262
AB  - The present research links a nonsocial, contextual influence (construal level) to the tendency to endorse genetic attributions for individual and social group differences. Studies 1 to 3 show that people thinking in an abstract (vs. concrete) mind-set score higher on a measure of genetic attributions for individual and racial group differences. Study 4 showed that abstract (vs. concrete) construal also increased genetic attributions for novel groups. Study 5 explored the potential downstream consequences of construal on intergroup attitudes, and found that abstract (vs. concrete) construal led people to endorse genetic attributions in general and this was associated with increased anti-Black prejudice.

T1  - Using nostalgia to reduce prejudice toward immigrants
AN  - 2011519324
AB  - Based on research that points to nostalgia as a means of warding off stigmatization, this study suggests that nostalgia triggered by a past encounter with a close immigrant from the in‐group can improve attitudes toward out‐group immigrants. Focusing on immigration in Greece, 99 university students (M = 23.06, SD = 5.44) participated in the study. Participants who were induced with nostalgia reported higher social connectedness, inclusion of the out‐group in the self, out‐group trust, and positive out‐group attitude compared with participants in the control condition. The aforementioned findings demonstrated that the positive effects of nostalgia about a close in‐group member (in this case, a Greek person), who shares an identity with the out‐group (being an immigrant), can generalize to the out‐group as a whole (immigrants in general). Further implications and future directions on the use of nostalgia as a means of improving attitudes are addressed.

T1  - On the Structure of Subalternity and the Process of Subalternisation in India
AN  - 1941602286
AB  - The concept of subalternity, originally formulated by the Italian Marxist, Antonio Gramsci, was amplified by a few Indian historians by juxtaposing the elitist nationalist historiography with subaltern historiography providing a bottom-up perspective. This paper attempts to identify the structure of subaltern deprivations with special reference to India. The main sources of subalternisation in India are as follows: treating some groups/communities as outsiders to the polity (externalisation); assigning groups to the lowest rung of the social ladder (hierarchisation); denial of identity to some groups through a process of absorption (expansionism of the hegemonic group) and lastly, application of traditional norms of society to keep women in subordination (patriarchy). The groups/communities subjected to the process of subalternisation in contemporary India are dalits, adivasis, religious and linguistic minorities and women. Admittedly, the phenomenon of intersectionality creates a hierarchy among subaltern groups--some are cumulatively oppressed, based on several factors, while the oppression of others is anchored in one or two factors only.

T1  - Exploring the Mother-Adolescent Relationship as a Promotive Resource for Sexual and Gender Minority Youth
AN  - 1940969148
AB  - Research often analyzes gender minority youth and sexual minority youth as a single group, a practice that obscures differences in how gender identity and sexual orientation shape health. The present study uses intersectionality to explore similarities and differences in the relationships between minority stress theory variables in a sample of 28 gender minority and 135 sexual minority youth of color. We also explore the mother-adolescent relationship as a potential promotive resource for minority stress research with youth. Results find few differences in minority stressors, promotive resources, or health between sexual and gender minority youth. However, different patterns in the correlations between stressors, resources, and health were observed for each group, underscoring the need for researchers to consider sexual and gender minority youth as distinct groups. Furthermore, study findings suggest that the maternal relationship may be an important promotive resource for both sexual and gender minority youth.

T1  - Through the Looking Glass: White First-year University Students' Observations of Racism in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada
AN  - 1888628531
AB  - Despite the growing interest in microaggression theory (Sue et al. ), little research has been conducted on it through a sociological lens. In fact, the psychological research that does exist has been from the United States (Constantine ; Mercer et al. ; Ong et al. ; Sue et al. ) and Canada (Hernandez ; Houshmand ), focusing primarily on minorities. One area that remains unexplored is white observations of racism. This is especially relevant given that Sue et al. contend that it is those who are most disempowered rather than those who enjoy the privileges of power who are likely to accurately assess whether a racist act has occurred. With this view in mind, this article utilizes racial microaggression theory to investigate the observations of racism among a cohort of approximately 170 white freshman (i.e., first-year) university students in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. As this research is Canadian based, it presents an excellent opportunity to advance racial microaggression theory from an international perspective. The goal of this article then is to categorize white youths' observations of microaggressions in order to discuss and analyze their impact on minorities living in a highly homogeneous, white-dominated space.

T1  - Introduction: Religion and public life
AN  - 1891806457
AB  - Political debate about the place of religion and religious identities in liberal democracies is as vigorous as ever, as evidenced by Christians' assertiveness against what they regard as secularising tendencies and the attempt to eliminate their established place in public life, as well as religious minorities seeking to combat their often marginalised position and the specific injustices to which they are subject (such as anti-Semitism and Islamophobia). The papers in this collection aim to address these and similar issues, and to offer novel and fresh perspectives on some of the key themes and debates on religion and public life in contemporary political theory. In this introductory essay, we illustrate, first, the key elements of four contemporary debates on religion and public life which are explored in the articles that follow. These are the conflict between secularism and religious establishment, public reason and the use of religious arguments in public deliberation, the accommodation of religious beliefs, and the relationship between freedom of speech and religion. After surveying these debates we end with an overview of the essays in this special issue.

T1  - The Impact of Adolescents' Classroom and Neighborhood Ethnic Diversity on Same- and Cross-Ethnic Friendships Within Classrooms
AN  - 1871510067
AB  - This study examines how classroom and neighborhood ethnic diversity affect adolescents' tendency to form same- versus cross-ethnic friendships when they enter middle school. Hypotheses are derived from exposure, conflict, and constrict theory. Hypotheses are tested among 911 middle school students (43 classrooms, nine schools) in the Netherlands. Multilevel (p2) social network analyses show that students were more likely to engage in same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friendships. In line with conflict theory, greater classroom and neighborhood diversity were related to stronger tendencies to choose same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friends, among both ethnic majority and minority students. Diversity did not hamper reciprocity, as students in more ethnically diverse classrooms were even more likely to reciprocate friendships.

T1  - From diversity to conviviality: intra-EU mobility and international migration to Denmark in times of economic recession
AN  - 1869136048
AB  - This article explores differences among EU and non-EU migrants in accommodating to the Danish flexicurity labour and welfare regime during times of economic crisis. We build our findings on a quantitative survey followed by semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with EU and non-EU migrants who moved to Denmark during the recession period (2008-2013). We argue that the lack of multicultural policies triggers individualised strategies of accommodation rather than ethnic or national group base integration, favouring a more homogenous group of high-skilled and educated group of workers and students of postgraduate/higher education, whom we describe as a 'flexicurity diversity group'. Through patterns of conviviality, individual socialisation is based here on common interests, needs and lifestyles and not on pre-defined ethnic and/or cultural traits. The transition from diversity to conviviality that is initiated by this group remains however incomplete in light of the unequal opportunities and the differentiated scheme of rights that apply to EU and non-EU immigrants. Danish flexicurity has thus not had the desired inclusive effects but discriminates in terms of facilitating easy access to the labour market for all, and 'securing' social benefits and offering rights and protection only to the privileged group of EU migrants.

T1  - Indigenous in the city: the politics of urban Mapuche identity in Chile
AN  - 1864691243
AB  - In this article, I analyse how urban Mapuche indigenous organizations in Chile conduct politics, both externally in relation to the state and internally in relation to other Mapuches. I suggest that the state creates the context for their politics through enacting centuries of policies that put Mapuche identity 'under siege'. My analysis shows that urban Mapuche organizations respond to this context in three central ways. Some organizations refuse the moniker 'urban' and are temporarily urban. Others embrace their urbanity and are adamantly urban. Still others try to overcome the rural-urban divide to become reconciled urban. Each of these strategies deploys ideas of authenticity in different ways, opening possibilities for different kinds of political alliances. My research argues that when the stakes are high for claiming a racial or ethnic identity, choosing which aspects of identity on which to base political demands has profound political consequences.

T1  - Using Groups to Measure Intergroup Prejudice
AN  - 1851015712
AB  - Implicit measures of racial attitudes often assess reactions to images of individuals to infer attitudes toward an entire social category. However, an increasing amount of research indicates that responses to individuals are highly dependent on context and idiosyncratic features of individual exemplars. Thus, using images of individuals to assess beliefs about a whole social category may not be ideal. Across three time points, we predicted that using images of groups would mitigate the influence of idiosyncratic features of individual targets and, thus, provide a better measurement tool to assess beliefs about a category to which all group members belong. Results revealed that an implicit measure that presented images of Black and White groups had greater construct validity, test-retest reliability, and predictive validity as compared with an implicit measure that presented the same exemplars individually. We conclude that groups provide a window into existing beliefs about social categories.

T1  - Animosities in Yugoslavia before its demise: Revelations of an opinion poll survey
AN  - 1840582267
AB  - Contrary to the widespread opinion that hatred and mutual dislike among various ethnic groups was a chief characteristic of Yugoslavia and was at the bottom of the country's destruction, the ethnic distance survey conducted in 1990 indicates that Yugoslav society was a community with a generally low level of ethnic animosities. The results demonstrate the huge discrepancy between what most Yugoslav citizens felt and needed, and what political elites and nationalist intellectuals claimed "their people" wanted and needed in the 1990s. Many scholars have not incorporated or noticed the difference.

T1  - The Politics of Walmart Moms: Parenthood and Political Attitudes in the 2012 Election
AN  - 1843964433
AB  - This research uses 2012 National Election Studies data to explore how parenthood shapes the public opinion of women and men. Our analyses show that being a parent shapes attitudes on issues directly connected to children, such as government funding for education and day care, but also on issues less connected to the day-to-day activities of parenting, including the appropriate role of government and abortion. While the label "Walmart Mom" captures the reality that a large and growing number of mothers are struggling economically, the effect of motherhood, on most issues, holds for all women, regardless of socioeconomic status. This article discusses the implications of our findings concerning the politics of motherhood and fatherhood in light of the changing structure of America's families.

T1  - Towards empirical comparison of immigrant integration across nations
AN  - 1817595765
AB  - The ambitious attempt by Richard Alba and Nancy Foner to provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of immigrant integration across several immigration nations - namely the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands - concludes that low-status immigrant groups are marginal across all of these countries, and overall none of them stands out as particularly positive or negative. At the same time, some countries perform better than others on specific dimensions of integration, offset by less-favourable results on others. Dimensions examined include employment and economic mobility, overall economic well-being, residential inclusion, overcoming marginality based on race and religion, access to citizenship and political power, education for the children of immigrants, inter-group marriages and identification with the national society. The complexity of the analysis is daunting, and troubled in some aspects by empirical and methodological issues. The effort nonetheless moves the field forward substantially, and defines a new agenda for future research.

T1  - Who do migrant associations represent? The role of 'ethnic deservingness' and legal capital in migrants' rights claims in Turkey
AN  - 1814221847
AB  - Considering that established migrant associations often play an active role in migrants' rights advocacy, the relationship between them and the growing numbers of irregular migrants needs careful scrutiny. Looking at the encounters between irregular Bulgarian Turkish migrants and associations established by their co-ethnics who hold Turkish citizenship in Turkey, our ethnographic evidence shows that co-ethnic migrant associations mobilise the legal frame of 'ethnic deservingness' with the intention of welcoming co-ethnics to the Turkish homeland. In the absence of other formal organisations for rights advocacy, associations' appeals to this frame emerge as a civic resource for the irregular newcomers in their permanent residency claims. At the same time, the same frame hides unequal power relations within co-ethnic communities, that is, newcomers' peripheral positions within associations and the economic costs of filing claims via associations. This situation creates a representational gap in the associational context between its active members with higher legal capital and irregular newcomers with lower legal capital. Tackling the problem of representation determined by the legal hierarchy, this study questions whether migrant associations should still be considered important political actors when undocumented/irregular migrants outnumber regulars-especially with regard to the immediate political/legal actions they require.

T1  - Religion and Religiosity in Russia
AN  - 2050768805
AB  - The collapse of the USSR marked the end of the multiethnic ‘Soviet Nation’. Consequent to the moving out of the republics from the federation, Russia and Russians faced the challenge of defining their own identity and that of a new, multinational, multi-confessional state—the Russian Federation. Towards this end of regenerating identity, religion proved to be a very potent instrument. Religion and religiosity in Russia is closely interconnected with ethnic self-awareness and consolidation of political identities that go beyond religion. It has been employed to foster both inclusive and exclusive identities and have also impacted crucial decisions of the state. Its social and political role is profound and so is its engagement with the institutions of the state. It is significant that both the institutional and ideological aspects of religion have emerged as distinct factors in contemporary Russian politics. The re-emergence and the consolidation of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) in the social and political life of contemporary Russia has submerged smaller religious identities in all spheres of social and political life. Given Russia’s religious diversity, this has impacted intergroup relations and generated tensions in the society, resulting from both the ‘politicization of religion’ and the ‘desecularization’ project from above.

T1  - Does Cultural Recognition Obstruct Immigrant Integration? Evidence From Two Historic Case Studies: IMR
AN  - 1797820191
AB  - Is multiculturalism compatible with immigrant integration? While effects of minority rights and cultural recognition are controversial, I argue that not only the analysis of multicultural policies in their interaction with other structures and policies deserves more attention, but also that a historical discussion may inform current debates. Comparing and analyzing the French Huguenots in Brandenburg-Prussia (1685-1809) and Germans in the Volga region (1764-1878), I find that incorporation outcomes, despite similarly extensive cultural rights, are driven by differing opportunity structures. These findings contribute to the growing literature on multiculturalism in Europe and advocate a new approach to its analysis.

T1  - Resistance and Assimilation: Transforming Security Roles of China's Largest Muslim Minorities
AN  - 1797942190
AB  - China's resurgence as an economic power has brought it increased interconnectivity to international global markets, and with it, increased exposure to transnational crimes. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and the resulting increase in religious-inspired terrorist attacks have been of particular concern for the Chinese leadership. This paper aims to highlight the processes of resistance and assimilation of China's two largest Muslim minorities, the Hui and Uyghur, in successive Chinese Empires since the eighth century CE and how critical events in the past two decades have affected the way in which the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) has approached relations with its Muslim minority communities. The purpose is two-fold: to expose these groups' stabilizing and destabilizing influence throughout the 1300 years of Muslim-Chinese coexistence, and to assess the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Party's Policies towards its Muslim minorities.

T1  - Divided and Conquered: Immigration Reform Advocates and the Passage of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act
AN  - 1786515758
AB  - During and immediately after World War II, immigration reform advocacy groups successfully challenged the restrictionist spirit of the 1924 Immigration Act by blocking several proposals to halt immigration and by pushing for moderate reforms. Concerned that the blatantly racist act undermined US foreign policy interests and tarnished the country's image abroad, Congress, with the full support of the executive, repealed Chinese exclusion laws; granted citizenship and naturalization rights to Indians and Filipinos; and admitted war brides, fiancées, and European refugees outside the quota system. Marinari argues the debate and the negotiations over the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act demonstrate the limits of the inclusiveness of the US political system during the early years of the Cold War and the difficulties of creating diverse coalitions among ethnically diverse immigration reform advocates.

T1  - Techniques for Protecting Minority Languages under Belgian Federalism
AN  - 1855325765
AB  - As one of the few countries in the Council of Europe, Belgium has, to date, not ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities as well as the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Nevertheless, minorities are protected in Belgium due to its specific federal structure. Several instruments provide a balance between the two major language groups in the country: the Flemish and the French-speaking language group. This article focuses on these special techniques and situates them in the historical and specific judicial background of Belgium.

T1  - Territoriality and Minority Language Rights
AN  - 1855323436
AB  - Territorial principle emerges not only in domestic legislations on language rights, but also in international documents. The article aims at offering an overview of the interpretations of territoriality in international documents relevant for minority language rights, with a special focus on the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages and the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. While states often use territorial requirements as a tool of political control over minority language use, the interpretation of their obligations under the two Council of Europe treaties would require a more practical and technical approach to territorial limitations.

T1  - REFLECTIONS OF MULTICULTURALISM AND PATRIOTISM IN SLOVENE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULA/Odsevi multikulturnosti in patriotizma v slovenskih osnovnosolskih ucnih nacrtih
AN  - 1830662397
AB  - The paper presents an analysis of the inclusion of patriotic elements in the curricula of elementary school subjects which are adapted to a multicultural environment. The legislative framework of the educational system in Slovenia anticipates the modification of curricula when elements of a minority's identity are in question. The results of the analysis can be summarised in two sets of findings: the method of the inclusion of patriotic elements differs firstly according to the subject's curriculum (absence of a strategic approach), and secondly depending on the minority in question. It seems as if the integration of patriotic elements in the curricula of both national minorities is coincidental.

T1  - Self-reference and (dis) equilibrium of psychomental complex: ethnic policies of 'social (dis) harmony' in Northeast China and 'national (dis) unity' in the Russian Far East
AN  - 1784139364
AB  - This work is an attempt to describe the reproduction of ethnic/national boundaries as a closed self-referential cognitive process that reproduces itself from itself. It describes some aspects of how this complex interrelation between cognitive structures and the formation of ethnic/national groups functions on the example of ethnic policies of 'social harmony' on the Northeast China and 'national unity' in the Russian Far East. The article shows how ethnic policies in both countries demonstrate the inability to provide either harmony or unity. However, these disappointed expectations return into national discourse as political ideologies that help preserve the government's legitimacy, legitimacy of the idea of nation/ethnicity and motivate the society to continue the nation-building process.

T1  - Sense of Place and Mental Wellness of Visible Minority Immigrants in Hamilton, Ontario: Revelations from Key Informants
AN  - 1778915998
AB  - This paper explores key informants’ revelations on immigrants’ sense of place and mental wellness in Hamilton, Ontario, directed toward processes and programs that challenge belongingness and integration. Grounded in key informant interviews, our analysis underscores the importance of understanding immigrants’ sense of community, belonging embedded in socioeconomic conditions, and implications on mental wellness. It is proposed that settlement service providers and other stakeholders adopt a broad and multifaceted approach that recognizes the importance of addressing immigrants’ conditions in a holistic manner. This could be achieved by focusing on policies that affect all determinants of health (including mental health) through the integration of public policies into a comprehensive package of health improvement and promotion strategies, and should be incorporated into policies of health and health-related institutions for implementation.

T1  - Do Immigrants' Preferences for Neighbourhood Qualities Contribute to Segregation? The Case of Oslo
AN  - 1784151344
AB  - Ethnic residential segregation is often explained with the claim that 'immigrants don't want to integrate-they prefer to stick together with co-ethnics'. By contrast, mixed neighbourhoods are seen as crucial for achieving social cohesion. In line with spatial assimilation theory there is a normative assumption that people interact with those living nearby. From interviews on neighbourhood qualities and locations valued by Oslo residents of Turkish, Somali and Polish backgrounds, we raise questions about the validity of two assumptions: that most immigrants want to live in the same neighbourhoods as co-ethnics; and that they want to live close to co-ethnics because they do not want to integrate. For reasons of socialisation, main preferences were for mixed neighbourhoods that included ethnic Norwegians. Whereas the preference for people of other immigrant backgrounds was linked to possibilities for socialisation, the preference for ethnic Norwegians in the neighbourhood was linked to possibilities for social integration. Co-ethnic networks could be maintained on the city level. Importantly, housing moves tended to be guided by other factors than population composition in the area.

T1  - Disciplined Preferences: Explaining the (Re)Production of Latino Endogamy
AN  - 1728660336; 201534259
AB  - While racial intermarriage is heralded as the last stage in integration processes, endogamy (intragroup marriage) is the overwhelming norm in the United States. What are the familial, dating, and community processes that produce endogamy? Drawing from 70 in-depth interviews with heterosexual Latinos concerning dating and marriage, this article reports that surveillance, punishment, and self-discipline harden racial boundaries and induce endogamy. Typically construed as highly personal, romantic preferences are, in fact, socially constructed and policed through family, peer, and community-level processes. 'Third parties' such as family members, friends, and community members enforce intramarriage via advice, threats, censure, and violence. In turn, outsiders' surveillance and punishment converts into self-discipline, which constrains romantic preferences and choices. To maintain social distance, both non-Hispanic whites and Latinos discipline their kin and their kin's cross-racial romantic interests away from those who stand lower on the racial order. Latinos enjoy racial privilege relative to African Americans and preserve privilege by excluding blacks as romantic possibilities. Latino endogamy is a disciplined response to accumulated racial messages and racial boundary policing. Results show that racial communities are invested in perpetuating endogamy to preserve relative privilege and exert social pressures that largely support the contemporary racial hierarchy. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - In diesem Beitrag diskutiere ich meine Erfahrungen des allmählichen Eintauchens in die Community in Australien lebender polnischer Migrant/innen, welcher ich beigetreten bin, als ich dort die Lebensgeschichten polnisch-stämmiger Autorinnen der Nachkriegszeit untersuchte. Ich zeige, wie sich meine Annahmen hinsichtlich der Gemeinsamkeiten von Kultur und Sprache während meiner Forschungsbegegnung mit den Autorinnen gewandelt haben: Zunächst nahm ich an, dass die Tatsache, dass ich dieselbe Sprache sprach wie die untersuchten Autorinnen, mich in die Lage versetzen würde, dasselbe kulturelle Wissen zu teilen und dadurch einen unmittelbaren Zugang zu den Forschungsteilnehmerinnen zu gewinnen. Die Sprache, so stellte es sich für mich heraus, markiert aber eher die Vielfalt statt der Einheitlichkeit von Erfahrungen, Positionierungen und gedanklichen Welten. Die Kategorie des Geschlechts, die ich zunächst als fluide und instabile Kategorie verstand, ersetzte jedoch die Sprache in ihrer Funktion eines Bindeglieds zwischen mir als Forscherin und meinen Forschungsteilnehmerinnen. Die Beispiele aus meiner Studie illustrieren, dass die Forschung zur Diaspora die Multiplizität der Identitätsmarker beachten muss, die die Forscher/innen diesseits und jenseits der Diaspora positionieren. Mein Beitrag basiert auf einer Vielzahl an Datenmaterial, einschließlich Feldnotizen, Feldtagebüchern und Interviews mit polnischen Autorinnen sowie Sekundärliteratur über Pol/innen und Australier/innen polnischer Abstammung in Australien.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1502165Alternate abstract:The article discusses my experiences of gradual immersion into the community of Polish migrants to Australia, which I joined while researching life writing of Polish post-war women migrants to Australia. I focus on how my assumptions concerning commonality of culture and language transformed during the preliminary stages of my research. I initially assumed that speaking the same language as the writers whose works I study, and their ethnic community, would position me as a person sharing the same cultural knowledge, and allow me immediate access to research participants. Yet, the language I considered to be the major marker of ethnic identity exhibited multiplicity instead of unity of experiences, positions and conceptual worlds. Instead, gender, which I had considered a fluid and unstable category highly context-dependent especially in the migration framework, proved to be an important element of interaction and communication between myself and my research participants. I have learnt that it is critical for research on diaspora, including diaspora's literary cultures, to account for other identity markers that include me as a researcher into some Polish community groups while excluding from others. I base my contribution on various kinds of materials, including field notes, fieldwork diaries and interviews with Polish writers as well as secondary literature on Poles and Australians of Polish extraction in Australia.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1502165Alternate abstract:El artículo discute mis experiencias de inmersión gradual en la comunidad de inmigrantes polacos a Australia, a la que me uní mientras investigaba la escritura vida de las mujeres polacas de posguerra migrantes a Australia. Me concentro en cómo mis supuestos relativos a la comunidad de cultura e idioma se transformaron durante las etapas preliminares de mi investigación. Inicialmente asumí que el hecho de compartir el mismo idioma que los escritores cuyas obras estudio, y su comunidad étnica, me posicionarían como una persona que comparte el mismo conocimiento cultural, y me permitiría el acceso inmediato a los participantes de la investigación. Sin embargo, el lenguaje que yo consideraba como el principal marcador de la identidad étnica exhibió multiplicidad en lugar de la unidad de experiencias, posiciones y mundos conceptuales. En cambio, el género, que yo había considerado una categoría fluida, inestable y altamente dependiente del contexto particular en el marco de la migración, ha demostrado ser un elemento importante de la interacción y la comunicación entre mi persona y mis participantes en la investigación. He aprendido que es crítica para la investigación sobre la diáspora, incluyendo las culturas literarias de la diáspora, para dar cuenta de otros marcadores de identidad que me incluyen como investigadora en algunos grupos de la comunidad polaca, excluyendo a los demás. Baso mi contribución en diversos tipos de materiales, incluyendo las notas de campo, diarios de campo y entrevistas con escritores polacos, así como literatura secundaria sobre los polacos y los australianos de origen polaco en Australia.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs1502165

T1  - Ukrainian Canadians, Canada, Ukraine, and the Popular Imagination
AN  - 1749279512
AB  - This special issue of Canadian Ethnic Studies is being published at the intersection of two momentous events. In Canada the 125th anniversary of Ukrainian settlement will be celebrated in 2016. Although it is highly likely that individual Ukrainians came to Canada much earlier, 1891 is generally accepted as the beginning of the first wave of mass migration from Ukraine. Canada is now home to the third largest population of Ukrainians in the world (after Ukraine and Russia), numbering over 1.2 million or approximately 4% of the population in 2011. In Ukraine, contemporaneously, a battle is being waged to preserve an independent, integral Ukraine. As recently as a quarter-century ago and for centuries before, the preceding reference would have been to “establishing,” not “preserving,” an independent Ukraine. In the century preceding 1991, when Ukraine declared its independence, Ukraine’s cultural heritage was under threat—as it had been for centuries before—but a variant of it was preserved and developed in Canada. This fact was noted with some surprise by Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine’s second president, when he was serenaded in Ukrainian by school children enrolled in the English-Ukrainian Bilingual program in Edmonton on October 25, 1994. With Ukraine’s declaration of independence, Ukrainian Canadians at last had an independent homeland with which they could identify. Older generations—especially the so-called “DPs” (Displaced Persons) who had been forced to leave Ukraine during and after World War II—returned to visit the country that had been preserved only in their memories. They came back to Canada having realized that their true homeland was Canada and were grateful for it. This realization was no doubt helped along when their naively offered, unsolicited advice on various matters was rebuffed by Ukraine’s first president, Leonid Krawchuk, who told them in no uncertain terms not to meddle in Ukraine’s affairs. Now, finally, we all seem to be on the same page. A younger, more sophisticated, worldly, and English-speaking leadership has emerged in Ukraine—a leadership that has recognized the importance of gaining the support of the Western world of which it wants to be a part. This change in attitude and outlook is exemplified by Ukraine’s national anthem: the first stanza was slightly modified in early 2013 and the result was the transformation of a dirge sung in a minor key in Canada to a triumphal hymn. Canada has responded positively and supportively to the most recent events in Ukraine, thereby eliciting President Putin’s dismissive and ill-informed comment. Canada had done the same in 1991 when Canada was the first country to recognize the newly-independent Ukraine. Of course, one does have to admit that the Canadian government’s response in both instances may not have been wholly altruistic since Ukrainians constitute the ninth largest ethnic group in the country and arguably exert more influence than their numbers might suggest because they are well organized and because of the younger, more activist leadership of their umbrella organization, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress.

T1  - 'Wolves Have A Constitution:' Continuities in Indigenous Self-Government
AN  - 1735655555; 201536845
AB  - This article is about constitutionalism as an Indigenous tradition. The political idea of constitutionalism is the idea that the process of governing is itself governed by a set of foundational laws or rules. There is ample evidence that Indigenous nations in North America-and in Australia and New Zealand as well-were in this sense constitutionalists. Customary law, cultural norms, and shared protocols provided well understood guidelines for key aspects of governance by shaping both personal and collective action, the behavior of leaders, decision-making, dispute resolution, and relationships with the human, material, and spirit worlds. Today, many of these nations have governing systems imposed by outsiders. As they move to change these systems, they also are reclaiming their own constitutional traditions.

T1  - Gypsies and Travellers: a big or divided society?
AN  - 1728661985; 201534223
AB  - The aim of this article is to explore the impact of localism on vulnerable minorities like Gypsies and Travellers. This paper draws on the literature on social contract, with particular reference to Hobbes, Rawls and Habermas. The key findings of this paper indicate that localism can impede equality but also that statist forms of centralism can be counterproductive to the achievement of equality. The insights in this paper contribute to the literature on equality by proposing a policy framework which fuses the participatory and deliberative practices associated with forms of localism with the safeguards and protection of centralism.

T1  - Senegalese immigrant families' 'regroupement' in France and the im/possibility of reconstituting family across multiple temporalities and spatialities
AN  - 1722763406
AB  - This paper interrogates the structural conditions, macropolitics and governmentality of family 'regroupement' in France in an era of shifting immigration policies in Europe and the imaginative possibilities that Senegalese immigrants exercise to maintain family and kinship ties with those left behind. It argues that while the need to maintain ties from diasporic locations is mediated by policies, material and emotive transnational practices, the materiality of displacement as well as the state's politics of immigration render more elusive possibilities of maintaining family in situ. What tensions and creative strategies emerge? How is 'home', the primordial site of family structure, reimagined and reconstituted? Taking into account state's politics and immigrants' entrapment within multiple spheres of power and their active agency as determinants, this paper uncovers how displacement gives rise to multiple ruptures while simultaneously motivating a search for active agency to reconstruct and reimagine kinship, family and conjugality across multiple temporalities and spatialities.

T1  - Unpacking the Roma Participation Puzzle: Presence, Voice and Influence
AN  - 1667946796; 201509574
AB  - The idea that Roma communities need to be included in public life is rather uncontroversial, widely accepted by Roma activists, academics and policy-makers in national and transnational political contexts. But, what do we mean by participation? Are we talking about formal political structures or do we refer to the capacity of ordinary Roma to have a presence in public life? The right to participation for minorities is specified by international norms but is interpreted differently in national contexts. Nevertheless, participation alone is not enough, thus minorities require 'effective' participation given that the utilitarian principles of liberal democracy means that groups such as Roma will always be outvoted. This article is based on the conviction that addressing the multiple and inter-connected issues facing Roma communities across Europe requires the participation of Roma in social, economic and political life. Whilst the article acknowledges the structural barriers which inhibit attempts to foster the integration of Roma communities, it does consider different conceptions of political participation including presence, voice and influence and how these are understood by the European Union and its member states with regards to Roma.

AN  - 1708525116; 201528885
AB  - Using three national surveys from the Great Recession period in America, I demonstrate two aspects of group-based political attitudes beyond citizens' partisanship preferences: (1) the economic scapegoating of African Americans by whites during the recession and (2) Latinos' and African Americans' use of their marginalized economic status as a lens for understanding how mortgage companies and bankers treated their communities during the downturn. I also discuss the broad impact of disparate economic opinions on citizens' political outlook for the future. The key patterns of political attitudes are shown to be remarkably consistent from 2009 to 2012. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - DIGITAL CITIZENSHIP AS MULTIPLE POLITICAL PARTICIPATION? PREDICTORS OF DIGITAL POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IN SLOVENIA
AN  - 1644297793
AB  - A significant decreasing trend in political participation could be observed in so-called Western democracies in the last decades of the 20th century. In this framework, researchers largely agree on the key factors of participation: from generational differences and socio-economic status through civic values to civic competencies. The emergence and expansion of the Internet have brought new opportunities to expand political participation practices and to include in these practices certain groups which have so far been less active. By analysing the presence of various forms of participation via the Internet in Slovenia, we assess a thesis on the (possible) expansion of space for political participation and search for answer(s) to research questions about the relationship between traditional forms of political participation in general and digital forms of participation: a) are online forms merely combining with other traditional forms of participation; or b) are they emerging as a new type of political participation? We also investigate whether digital participation does indeed involve new groups of people and who are potential 'digital citizens'. In the analysis, we use the latest data from the Slovenian Public Opinion Survey 2013, which includes both information on the forms of political participation generally and information on digital-specific forms of participation.

T1  - Effects of Interviewer-Respondent Gender Interaction on Attitudes toward Women and Politics: Findings from Morocco
AN  - 1728662594; 201534812
AB  - Women's rights is a salient and contested issue in contemporary Arab societies--particularly after the Arab spring--and a central theme in cross-national surveys conducted in Morocco, including the World Values Survey, Arab Barometer, and Pew Global Attitudes Survey. Despite their likelihood, interviewer gender effects have not been examined in the Middle East. This is concerning given the obvious possibility that interviewer gender could bias research on attitudes toward women (Benstead, 2010; Inglehart & Norris, 2003b; Jamal & Langohr, 2009; Norris, 2011)--for example, support for women political leaders which has been affected by social desirability in the USA (Phillips & Schuldt, 1993; Streb, Burrell, Frederick, & Genovese, 2008). It also misses the potential of the survey interaction to test social desirability and power relations theory; develop a comparative framework of response effects; and better understand gender relations in patriarchal societies. This study uses data from a nationally representative survey of Moroccans conducted in 2007 to investigate whether and why interviewer--respondent gender affects responses and item nonresponse for gender-sensitive questions and whether the effect varies across cultures. The study found strong evidence of two effects--interactive interviewer respondent gender effects on responses and interviewer gender effects on item nonresponse--that have been weak and inconsistent in U.S. samples, helping to clarify the conditions under which social desirability and power relations theories operate. In Morocco, males reported more egalitarian views to female interviewers, suggesting that when gender equality is salient--regardless of the cultural context--males seek to reduce social distance with females. Both genders were less likely to report item nonresponse to males--not to females, as in western societies--which suggests that power relations theory explains nonresponse effects in a strongly patriarchal society. These results highlight the need to control for interviewer gender and other traits, including religious dress and age, and to implement context-sensitive training, emphasizing probing and refusal aversion, particularly for female interviewers.

T1  - From Political to Material Inequality: Race, Immigration, and Requests for Public Goods
AN  - 1641423664; 201500271
AB  - Studies of political participation typically analyze voting, contentious collective action, or membership in voluntary associations. Few scholars investigate a more mundane-but highly consequential-form of neighborhood politics: requests for basic city services. We conceptualize city service requests as a direct, instrumental contact with local government that alters the geographical distribution of public goods. We hypothesize that rates of service requests vary with the ethnic and immigrant composition of neighborhoods, due to differences in these communities' expectations of local government. We test this hypothesis using administrative data from the City of Boston. We find neighborhoods with high concentrations of first-generation immigrants less likely to request services, relative to need. The concentration of African Americans, however, is associated with large increases in neighborhood service requests. We conclude with implications for the study of race, inequality, and political incorporation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - On the relationship between personal experience, affect and risk perception: The case of climate change
AN  - 1660020455; 201505484
AB  - Examining the conceptual relationship between personal experience, affect, and risk perception is crucial in improving our understanding of how emotional and cognitive process mechanisms shape public perceptions of climate change. This study is the first to investigate the interrelated nature of these variables by contrasting three prominent social-psychological theories. In the first model, affect is viewed as a fast and associative information processing heuristic that guides perceptions of risk. In the second model, affect is seen as flowing from cognitive appraisals (i.e., affect is thought of as a post-cognitive process). Lastly, a third, dual-process model is advanced that integrates aspects from both theoretical perspectives. Four structural equation models were tested on a national sample (N = 808) of British respondents. Results initially provide support for the 'cognitive' model, where personal experience with extreme weather is best conceptualized as a predictor of climate change risk perception and, in turn, risk perception a predictor of affect. Yet, closer examination strongly indicates that at the same time, risk perception and affect reciprocally influence each other in a stable feedback system. It is therefore concluded that both theoretical claims are valid and that a dual-process perspective provides a superior fit to the data. Implications for theory and risk communication are discussed.

T1  - A Preliminary Examination of African American and Caucasian Hospitality Management Student Perceptions and Attitudes Toward Diversity Issues
AN  - 1700676663; 201525293
AB  - Diversity or multiculturalism is a concept that includes words such as acceptance and respect. A movement toward diversity should include the examination of differences in a safe, cultivating, and constructive environment. One such environment is classrooms located on college and university campuses across the United States. The purpose of this study was to examine a cross-section of hospitality management students based on their ethnicity. A self-selected convenience sample of students were used with data being collected using a paper-and-pencil survey measuring attitudes and perceptions toward various diversity concepts. It was found that differences existed between the two ethnic groups around specific concepts of workplace equity. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The dialogicality of cleanliness 'thematizing' the clean/dirty antinomy in the background of the theory of social representations
AN  - 1728663366; 201533980
AB  - Speltini and Passini manuscript points to a theoretical framework for exploring the psychosocial dimensions of the issue of cleanliness addressing the clean/dirty and pure/impure antinomies. In particular, the authors discuss the symbolic and normative valence of the issue of cleanliness and demonstrate its social and cultural rootedness feeding negative attitudes and adverse emotions towards persons and groups. Elaborating on the arguments of Speltini and Passini, I endorse the conceptual overlapping between the issue of cleanliness and the dialogical notion of basic themata. In the background of social representation theory, the process of anchoring serves as context for addressing this conceptual overlapping and for challenging the profound interrelationship between the issue of cleanliness and the theme of intergroup dynamics and inter-ethnic encounters.

T1  - The theme of indivisibility in the post-war struggle against prejudice in the United States
AN  - 1660024003; 201505829
AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Herbert Gans and the death of Miss Norway
AN  - 1551001554; 201429010
AB  - Herbert Gans's 1979 article on 'symbolic ethnicity' among later-generation white ethnics in the USA flew in the face of much of what was then conventional wisdom. Today, however, with the lessons of more than three decades of history, his prediction of a steady diminution of ethnic identity and ethnic mobilization among third-plus-generation white ethnics seems to have been borne out. While ethnicity among later-generation white Americans will probably never disappear completely, it seems destined to play a smaller role in American life in the coming years, symbolic assertions of diversity notwithstanding.

T1  - Transgressing community: the case of Muslims in a twenty-first-century British city
AN  - 1551000471; 201428992
AB  - This paper draws on ethnographic research carried out in Birmingham, UK -- a city significant for its sizeable Muslim population and its iconic role in the history of minority ethnic settlement in Britain -- to consider how associations of place and ethnicity work in different ways to inform ideas about 'Muslim community' in twenty-first-century Britain. The paper charts happenings around a local event in an area of majority Asian settlement and how representations of the area as a place of Muslim community were used to implicate it in the 'war on terror'. The paper goes on to show how this sensibility is disrupted by Muslims themselves through alternative engagements with space and ethnicity. The paper argues that these offer a ground for making Muslim community in ways that actively engage with histories and patterns of ethnic settlement in the city rather than being determined by them.

T1  - Beyond Treatment and Impact: A Context-Oriented Approach to Employment Discrimination
AN  - 1512220941; 201408813
AB  - Discrimination remains integral to understanding both how inequality is produced and how it can be remedied in employment settings. Yet like many sociological concepts, the notion of discrimination involves an uneasy mapping of theory to practice. Traditional conceptualizations of discrimination as differential treatment are ill-fitted to the structural and relational nature of much discrimination in the contemporary era. The disparate impact doctrine, which recognizes policies or practices that systematically disadvantage protected groups, picks up some of the theoretical slack, but offers little in the way of conceptualizing individuals' complex and entangled experiences with inequality at work. In this article, I provide a conceptual reorganization of theories of discrimination, underscoring recent calls to move beyond the confines of the current disparate treatment and disparate impact binary by recognizing the structurally and culturally embedded nature of bias and discrimination. Drawing on recent sociological research as well as my own analysis of legal records and interviews with plaintiffs involved in high-profile sex and race lawsuits settled in the past decade, I illustrate how differential treatment emerges in the context of and enabled by systems of vulnerability and privilege, workplace culture, and compositional asymmetries. I conclude with a discussion of the implications of this framework for antidiscrimination enforcement efforts. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - 'He thinks Krishna is his friend': Domestic space and temple sociality in the socialisation beliefs of immigrant Indian Hindu parents
AN  - 1531932327; 201423279
AB  - This paper reports results from a study of the cultural belief systems, or ethnotheories, of Asian Indian Hindu parents in the city of Baltimore, Maryland, in the USA. I adopted a cultural, developmental psychological approach and, over a one-year period, used caregiver diaries, ecological inventories, repeated in-depth interviews and participant observations to gain access to the ethnotheories of the parents. These immigrant parents emphasised family ties, unprompted adherence to the daily routine, knowledge of cultural origins and religiously inflected moral values. Exploring the nuances of their emphasis on cultural origins and moral and religious values, particularly as those relate to Hinduism and its transnational rearticulation, I show how the parents utilised domestic spaces and the temple as dual venues to systematically socialise their children into a new form of Hindu religious and 'Indian' ethnic identity in the USA.

T1  - 'Lived' Identities in Rwanda: Beyond Ethnicity?
AN  - 1728663068; 201534271
AB  - Identity politics in post-genocide Rwanda has continued to centre around ethnicity, whereas this article argues that the 'lived' identities of Rwandans are far more complex and varied than the identity of ethnicity. The Rwandan government has attempted to transcend ethnicity through laws that prohibit the use of ethnicities and the introduction of a particular kind of citizenship discourse. Critics of the government call for more open and robust discussion of ethnicity in the public sphere, and tend to emphasise the perceived unequal access to resources as a central problem in ethnic identity politics in Rwanda. This article attempts to move beyond both these positions, which place the root cause of and solution to identity politics in Rwanda within an ethnic framework, by exploring the complex network of interrelationships in which people move in their daily lives.

T1  - Does Climate Change Worsen Resource Scarcity and Cause Violent Ethnic Conflict?
AN  - 1622297003; 201438437
AB  - Does climate change create conditions in which ethnic groups, particularly in developing countries, become more likely to struggle for scarce resources which can then spur ethnically motivated violence and serious atrocities? Or is the relation between climate change and atrocities, if there is one, far more complex and perhaps indirect? How should climate change be viewed as a risk factor for the onset of violent ethnic conflict? What practical relevance could climate change effects have on early warning and prevention of serious human rights violations including crimes against humanity and genocide? The author first considers whether climate change science warnings deserve to be taken seriously before reviewing empirical studies focussing on the supposed link between climate change and ethnic conflict. Second, he argues that it is valuable to treat climate change as a possible risk factor for ethnic conflict situations in which crimes against humanity or genocide might be perpetrated, and to reflect upon early warning and prevention in this connection. The author then sets out five considerations mat research on the question of a causal link between climate change and ethnic conflict should take into account. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assimilation or Cultural Difference? Palestinian Immigrants in Honduras
AN  - 1622296399; 201438425
AB  - This article looks at Palestinian immigrants in contemporary Honduras. It questions the general assumption that Palestinians have successfully assimilated into predominantly mestizo societies. It shows that the Palestinian community has maintained various features and references, such as their religious affiliation and their activity in commerce and trade, that make them a culturally differentiated group. This article also explores why, against the recent backdrop of multiculturalism, the Palestinian immigrant community have not mobilized an ethnic identity in order to gain access to resources or demand collective recognition. Furthermore, it shows that Palestinian immigrants have benefitted from various macro and local political and economic factors and policies that contributed to the accumulation of different forms of capital throughout the 20th century.

T1  - When Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Preventing Discrimination of Nonstandard Speakers
AN  - 1504424509; 201406703
AB  - Prejudice against a social group may lead to discrimination of members of this group. One very strong cue of group membership is a (non)standard accent in speech. Surprisingly, hardly any interventions against accent-based discrimination have been tested. In the current article, we introduce an intervention in which what participants experience themselves unobtrusively changes their evaluations of others. In the present experiment, participants in the experimental condition talked to a confederate in a foreign language before the experiment, whereas those in the control condition received no treatment. Replicating previous research, participants in the control condition discriminated against Turkish-accented job candidates. In contrast, those in the experimental condition evaluated Turkish- and standard-accented candidates as similarly competent. We discuss potential mediating and moderating factors of this effect.

T1  - Intellectual Biography, Empirical Sociology and Normative Political Theory: An Interview with Tariq Modood
AN  - 1504422979; 201405504
AB  - An interview is presented with Tariq Modood, Professor of Sociology, Politics and Public Policy at the University of Bristol, the founding director of the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Citizenship, and the co-founding editor of the international academic journal Ethnicities. During his academic career he has worked widely on ethnic and religious minority issues: from disadvantages and opportunities in higher education and the labour market to 'ethnic capital'; from the theory and politics of multiculturalism and secularism to political conflict and political accommodation. His approach to minority issues has always been characterised by a special focus on religious identity and a special commitment to the British Muslim community and to British multiculturalism. His work -- an interdisciplinary approach which combines the normative political theory of multiculturalism and the sociology of post-migration ethnicity -- is broadly acknowledged in the field of ethnic minority research (Law and Swann 2011:5).

T1  - Factors Affecting Wealth Accumulation in Hispanic Households: A Comparative Analysis of Stock and Home Asset Utilization
AN  - 1512219222; 201408798
AB  - This research addresses differences between Hispanic (N = 2,333) and White (N = 15,521) households in the ownership and allocation of two representative measures of wealth accumulation, stock and homeownership. Using data from the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, this research estimates a two-stage interaction model to examine differences in both asset ownership and asset allocation decisions. This article established two important findings: (1) results indicate that the negative effects of Hispanic ethnic identity on asset ownership were the result of disadvantaged positions of Hispanic households in the distribution of financial, immigration-related, and demographic characteristics, and (2) once ownership was controlled for, there is no difference in the holdings of stock allocation or home equity between Hispanic and White households.

T1  - Identity and Belonging among Ethnic Return Migrants of Oman
AN  - 1512219600; 201408833
AB  - This article explores the nature, construction, and negotiation of identity among Oman's ethnic return migrants called Zinjibaris. Using a social psychological approach, in which ethnic identity is conceptualized as fluid and socially constructed, the study examines how these migrants first define their identity in Zanzibar and then redefine it and forge a sense of belonging on returning to their ancestral homeland. The life stories of four women, representing three generations of returnees, highlight the role played by sociohistorical narratives and Arab descent ideology in constructing a multihyphenated identity-Zinjibari-Omani and Arab-Omani. They also reveal the implications of such an identity positioning for processes of inclusion and differentiation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The contribution of the population of disabled people to the attainment of Europe 2020 Strategy headline targets
AN  - 1494300544; 201402008
AB  - This study seeks to quantify the potential contribution of one of the most disadvantaged groups in Europe, namely Europe's population of disabled people, to the attainment of the Europe 2020 Strategy targets via the monitoring of a number of indicators, at a time when, given the current economic crisis, the majority of European countries are struggling to attain these goals. The impact of changes in the situation of disabled people is simulated using micro data drawn from the 2009 European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. Our results show that improving the socio-economic situation of the disabled population could be crucial for attaining Europe 2020 targets. However, future policy designs at national level will need to take into account the actual definition of disability that is employed, the heterogeneity of circumstances to be found within such a definition, and the gap between the situation of the disabled and non-disabled populations.

T1  - The Relation Between Parental Racial Socialization and African Americans' Racial Ideologies
AN  - 1438564599; 201340215
AB  - Racial ideology shapes how African Americans interpret the world and cope with race-related issues and events. A complex interaction of individual, family, and group experiences in one's sociocultural and historical context is critical to the development of racial ideology. While parental racial socialization has been associated with racial identity, the more specific relationship between parental racial socialization and racial ideology is less understood. The present study examined the association of four dimensions of racial socialization messages reported by participants (cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarian socialization) with four dimensions of racial ideology (assimilationist, humanist, oppressed minority, and nationalist) using hierarchical linear regression (n = 89 African American college students). Participants' endorsement of assimilationist and oppressed minority ideologies was not predicted by racial socialization messages. However, endorsement of humanist and nationalist ideologies was predicted by cultural and egalitarian socialization messages in opposing directions. Cultural socialization was associated with endorsement of higher nationalist and lower humanist ideology, whereas egalitarian socialization was associated with the endorsement of lower nationalist and higher humanist ideology.

T1  - Prejudice toward American Muslims
AN  - 1703413151
AB  - This study explores prejudice toward American Muslims. Prejudice is conceptualized using Stephan and Stephan's integrated threat theory (ITT). ITT identifies four kinds of threat that can lead to prejudice: realistic threats, symbolic threats, stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Data were gathered in the United States (N = 281) among self-identified Christians. Findings confirm: 1) a positive correlation between real and symbolic threats, and stereotypes, 2) increased contact with an immigrant group, in this case Muslims, is negatively correlated with perceptions of real and symbolic threat, and 3) levels of prejudice differ based on level of education. Theoretical and practical implications of the relationship between prejudice, interpersonal contact/communication, and education are discussed.

T1  - Relationship between cross-cultural attitudes and attitudes toward the foreign language study of tourism majors: the South Korean Case
AN  - 1429639862; 201335798
AB  - Cross-cultural attitudes are gaining more importance as contacts between people from different cultures are increasing in a globalized world. This is particularly the case and relevant for the tourism industry. The major purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between cross-cultural attitudes and the attitudes toward foreign language within the tourism education context. An empirical study of 482 tourism students in South Korea revealed that cross-cultural attitudes had significant associations with attitudes toward studying a foreign language. Specifically, the 'integrative attitude', among the three types of attitudes toward foreign language study, showed the highest relationship with the 'cross-cultural attitude', being followed by the 'intrinsically motivated attitude'. However, the 'instrumental attitude' showed no significant relationship. Based on these findings, a need to approach language study from cultural perspectives is emphasized, suggesting a provision of programs and activities inspiring direct and indirect contacts with foreign cultures and people. The integration of cultural aspects of the tourism industry into foreign language study was also discussed in this context. Finally, the study's results were compared with those of previous studies and a tentative generalization that foreign language study has an effect in reducing social distance was proposed.

T1  - The Empire Prays Back: Religion, Secularity, and Queer Critique
AN  - 1429625457; 201335708
AB  - The past decades have been ones of unprecedented sociocultural and legal gains for queer politics. But these achievements have been accompanied by a severe critique of queer racism and of the imperialist agenda of global gay politics. The employment of gender and sexuality as alibis for legitimizing violence against religious groups, especially Muslims, has opened up fundamental questions regarding the future of queer emancipatory politics. While supportive of the urgency of critiquing the complicities of Western queer politics in neoliberal, imperial discourses, I am troubled by the silences on and the lack of critique of homophobia and heterosexism in diasporic and postcolonial contexts. The unwillingness to address the violent experiences of those subjects who are vulnerable to both queer racism as well as postcolonial heteronormativity has become the Achilles' heel of the recent postsecular turn in queer postcolonial scholarship and activism. Religious violence against sexual minorities is ignored by prioritizing violence against religious minorities. The sole focus on queer racism and homonationalism in the global North neglects how supposedly conflicting ideologies of heteronormative nationalisms on both sides of the postcolonial divide in fact collaborate with each other. There is an urgent need to explore nonimperialist strategies of contesting heterosexism and homophobia in diasporic and postcolonial contexts and pursue a more complex, multidirectional politics of critique that is directed at coercive practices across the secularism-religion divide. Critique, when engaging with solely one dimension of domination, risks reproducing violence. Thus, anti-imperialist and antiracist critique of queer politics must be accompanied by a critique of "reproductive heteronormativity" within postcolonial contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Arranged Marriages as Support for Intra-ethnic Matchmaking? A Case Study on Muslim Migrants in Germany
AN  - 1364702404; 201323432
AB  - This article discusses the behavioural and institutional mechanisms that guide the matchmaking process of arranged marriages amongst Muslim migrants in Germany and clarifies how this practice may influence ethnic homogamy. The focus is on general characteristics of arranged marriages rather than differences between diverse ethnic groups. The methodology is qualitative due to the sensitive and complex topic and the current state of research. Typically, the whole family is deeply involved in the process of arrangement, which consists of three stages (pre-engagement, engagement, marriage). Thereby, the extension of parental scope of action by means of institutionalized admission procedures turns out to be vitally important. In consideration of the fact that mate selection takes place at the pre-engagement stage, it is the most crucial. Furthermore, differences to other partner-choosing processes are at their most distinct at this point, being responsible for the identification and labelling of this model as an arranged marriage. Selection criteria are mainly determined by the reputation of the marriage candidate and her/his family along with cultural features (such as belonging to a particular religious group, ethnicity or nationality). In our study, preferences for a cultural homogenous match were the most dominant ones. This inclination may cause the tendency towards transnational marriages when there are no suitable marriage candidates to be found in Germany. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: Macro-level Symbolic Threat Increases Prejudice Against Gay Men
AN  - 1504422883; 201405314
AB  - Two studies examined the impact of macrolevel symbolic threat on intergroup attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 71), participants exposed to a macrosymbolic threat (vs. nonsymbolic threat and neutral topic) reported less support toward social policies concerning gay men, an outgroup whose stereotypes implies a threat to values, but not toward welfare recipients, a social group whose stereotypes do not imply a threat to values. Study 2 (N = 78) showed that, whereas macrolevel symbolic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward gay men, macroeconomic threat led to less favorable attitudes toward Asians, an outgroup whose stereotypes imply an economic threat. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding the role of a general climate of threat in shaping intergroup attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Psychological Factors Associated with Support for Suicide Bombing in the Muslim Diaspora
AN  - 1283642546; 201306685
AB  - A robust literature on ingroup versus outgroup conflict suggests that perceived discrimination may be an important factor in intergroup aggression. Yet, to date, no studies have tested the hypothesis that the perception of being the victim of anti-Muslim discrimination might be associated with support for anti-Western political violence. We undertook an analysis of two Pew Global Attitudes Surveys: (1) a 2006 data set surveying 1,627 adult Muslim residents of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain and (2) a 2007 data surveying 1,050 adult Muslim residents of the United States. Our analyses support the conclusions that younger age and perceived discrimination are both associated with support of suicide bombing in these Muslim diaspora populations. Study 1 found that a bad experience of discrimination increased the odds of justifying suicide bombing among European Muslims by a factor of 3.4. Study 2 found that experienced discrimination was associated with justification of suicide bombing among American Muslims. If further investigations confirm that perceived discrimination is a risk factor for support for political violence, initiatives to reduce discrimination would theoretically reduce the risk of terrorism. We discuss the challenge of breaking the vicious cycle of intergroup prejudice and radicalization. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Deconstructing Good Times and The Cosby Show: In Search of My "Authentic" Black Experience
AN  - 1373427882; 201328616
AB  - As countless critics of The Cosby Show (1984-1992) would have us believe, the Huxtable family, as portrayed and envisioned by educator and comedian Bill Cosby, is not the traditional representation of Black family life. For many critics, as well as some Cosby show defenders, the experience depicted by the fictional Huxtable family was the unique experience of too few African Americans at the time; the suggestion is that the family is very wealthy. Contrary to the moral majority, its critics and defenders, I am not from the upper or middle classes like the Huxtable family; however, I identified with The Cosby Show more than with its predecessors, like Good Times (1974-1979). African Americans are no different than any other American group, and therefore, as writer and novelist Wendy Alexia Rountree suggests in her article " 'Faking the Funk': A Journey Towards Authentic Blackness," we "should be allowed to develop individual identities that are not considered in conflict with our ethnic group identity but as a legitimate part of it." Consequently, as someone who identifies with The Cosby Show; who is an autistic, working-class Black female from the projects of East Harlem with two Ivy League degrees; and for whom cowboy boots are her footwear of choice, I say, take Good Times and The Cosby Show if you must, but leave me my Black experience.

T1  - The Ghettoization of Blacks in Los Angeles: The Emergence of Street Gangs
AN  - 1364700153; 201323330
AB  - Despite previous research, no one has traced the roots and rise of African-American street gangs in Los Angeles as it relates to the development of racially and ethnically segregated areas. This paper examines the experiences of the early African-American community and explains the cultural phenomenon that led to the formation of African-American gangs. The rapid migration of African-Americans to the city caused their population in Los Angeles to increase, and this threatened the White community. As a result of racial discrimination and racial covenants, many African-Americans became trapped in Watts, which was formerly a White middle-class community of government employees and white-collar workers. This transformed South Central (Watts) into a ghetto of predominantly poor urban Black dwellers with low-paying jobs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - WHAT WE FACE
AN  - 1531930673; 201423292
AB  - While many sociological studies analyze the causes, conditions, and mechanisms perpetuating American racial inequality, the literature on how African Americans understand and explain these inequalities is less developed. Drawing on 150 interviews with middle-class and working-class African American men and women, this paper analyzes inductively how respondents define and conceptualize the most pressing obstacles facing their group when probed on this question. We find that middle- and working-class respondents alike identify the problem of racism as the most salient obstacle facing African Americans. Class differences appear with respect to what other obstacles are singled out as salient: while middle-class respondents focus on lack of racial solidarity among Blacks and economic problems (in this order), working-class respondents are more concerned with the fragility of the Black family followed by the lack of racial solidarity. This analysis discusses the relevance of considering how groups make sense of obstacles, and of racism and discrimination in particular, for the study of destigmatization and antiracist strategies of stigmatized minorities.

T1  - 'Frugal and Thrifty, Hard-Working and Sober': Representations of Scottishness in New Zealand
AN  - 1023030089; 201223911
AB  - This article addresses the representations of Scottishness at individual and collective levels, as expressed by outsiders and insiders. It does so by merging a focus on the organisational dimensions of ethnicity as well as the essences that individuals and groups believed to constitute Scottishness. The study also endeavours to assess whether Scottish ethnicities were distinctive by making brief comparisons with expressions of Irish ethnic identities in New Zealand. It concludes that features of Scottishness were positively asserted without the influence of conflict and defensive unity. Void of political overtones, Scottishness also remained a predominantly cultural expression compared with the more defensive, political tenor of Irishness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Transnational Parenting and Immigration Law: Central Americans in the United States
AN  - 1023030556; 201223917
AB  - In recent years, many immigrant-receiving countries have implemented increasingly restrictive policies that include tighter border controls, more temporary worker permits, an increased threat of deportation, and greater restrictions on the ability to acquire permanent residence and to petition for family members. Thus, family separation seems to be built into new immigration policies, and long-term and indefinite separations are not the exception. In this article, I examine the case of the largest Central American immigrant groups: Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans. Many of these immigrants are neither fully 'undocumented' nor 'documented', but often straddle both statuses as a result of having received a series of temporary permits over a period of more than a decade. This legal instability profoundly influences parenting across borders among these immigrants-both the relations between parents and children who are separated, and the links between these immigrant families and the different institutions in the host society. The experiences of Central Americans present a special opportunity to reflect on the effects of current immigration regimes on families separated across borders. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnogenesis, Ethnicity, And "Cultural Refusal": The Case of the Salasacas in Highland Ecuador
AN  - 1438549202; 201340197
AB  - The Salasacas are one of several indigenous peoples in highland Ecuador who consider themselves, and are considered by others, to be a distinct, homogeneous blood group. Throughout the Incaic, Spanish, and national periods, we trace their ethnogenesis from diverse origins to a single, highly unified ethnic community, Using an interdisciplinary methodology that combines historical and ethnographic data and follows the movement of current Salasaca anthroponyms, we identify three seventeenth-century migrations of different groups to Salasaca. These groups were still separate in the eighteenth century, and we follow their fusion into a single, exclusive, and vocal ethnic group in the post-independence period. We focus careful attention on their often novel responses to multiple historical contingencies over the course of five hundred years. Departing from writers who emphasize the political nature of ethnicity, we argue that Salasaca became a zone of cultural refusal as indigenous actors made a conscious decision to maintain a specific indigenous cultural identity.

T1  - Identity Satisfaction Over the Life Course in Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266144742; 201300382
AB  - A variety of models have been proposed to understand the process of coming to terms with a sexual minority identity. What has not been so clearly explored is how an individual's satisfaction with his or her sexual identity develops over the life course. This article explores satisfaction with sexual identity in a large cohort (N = 2,269) of self-identified lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, and considers satisfaction not only from a chronos (life span) but also from a chairos (stage of development) framework. Data show a clear relationship between age group and increased satisfaction with a sexual minority identity. Resilience may be an important contributor to increased satisfaction.

T1  - The Effect of Classroom Diversity on Tolerance and Participation in England, Sweden and Germany
AN  - 1023030546; 201223877
AB  - The belief is widespread in educational circles that ethnically mixed schools contribute to inter-ethnic tolerance and community cohesion. Some political science studies, however, have found that trust and participation are lower in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. This paper explores the relation between classroom ethno-racial diversity, ethnic tolerance and participation in England, Sweden and Germany using data from the IEA Civic Education Study among 14-year-olds. Controlling for various conditions at the individual and classroom levels, it finds a positive effect of classroom diversity on ethnic tolerance in Sweden and Germany, which is in agreement with the contact perspective on inter-ethnic relations. However, it does not find an effect on tolerance in England. Moreover, classroom diversity only shows a positive relation with participation in Sweden. The effect of diversity thus varies substantially across the two outcomes of interest and the three countries examined. It is therefore tentatively concluded that country-specific factors shape this effect to a significant degree. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Paradigm Shifts, Geostrategic Considerations and Minority Initiatives
AN  - 1030866915; 201227884
AB  - Much of the analysis of ethnolinguistic minorities is case specific and concerned with the particular state or national context within which such minorities operate. This paper adopts abroad conceptual stance by focussing on how policies aimed at improving the position of ethnolinguistic minorities in Europe have been subject to broad and profound multi-level influences. These range from policies and practices which have their origin within the minority communities themselves, to the state, the European level and beyond. This paper will identify significant paradigm shifts and highlight structural tensions which derive from neo-liberal and social democratic perspectives coming into conflict as a result of closer European integration and globalization. It will conclude by identifying six salient research themes which may inform more robust policy initiatives capable of building on best practice minority policy in several EU contexts.

T1  - Perceived Expectations for Acculturation: The Transitioning of Hispanics into Southern Communities
AN  - 1266144813; 201300329
AB  - Hispanics are a rapidly growing population that has sought resettlement in nontraditional locations across the United States. Movement in and out of cultural homogeneous communities has implications for an individual's perceived expectations for cultural change. Hispanics (N = 10) in two Southern states were asked questions using semi-structured interviews surrounding their acculturation experiences. Using a grounded theory approach, several themes emerged involving the perceived acceptance of their culture, previous and current ethnic composition of their community, cultural values and behaviors underpinning interaction, and perceived pressures to maintain and change their culture. The comfort and discomfort in interacting with other cultural groups often elicited pressure to change, suppress, or maintain one's culture. Targeted intervention efforts addressing community-level acculturative expectations and individual acculturative difficulties with intercultural interaction may assist Hispanics entering nontraditional areas of resettlement. Social services and policy that recognizes the importance of multicultural growth in their communities, and seeks to identify the current state of social and relational inclusiveness of traditionally marginal groups, may improve racial and ethnic relationships and community health.

T1  - Focus groups as a tool in the construction of questionnaires: the case of discriminatory attitudes
AN  - 1081862461; 201234719
AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Lived Islam: religious identity with 'non-organized' Muslim minorities
AN  - 907927959; 201124692
AB  - The purpose of this article is to show how a focus on 'non-organized' Muslims in Europe can contribute with insights on the everyday lives and practices of Muslim minorities. The empirical foundation is interviews conducted in Germany and Denmark. I argue that by focusing on institutionalized forms of Islam we run the risk of reifying Muslims as being 'all about Islam'. The article reflects and discusses the benefits of adapting the framework of lived religion methodologically to investigate how Muslim makes sense of Islam on a micro-level. I show how the interviewees in this study have reconfigured religious practices, or no practice at all, which is connected to attitudes of privatization, individualization and pragmatism. The everyday practices and identities can be seen as expressions of minority identities, and as a type of individualized religiosity, and I discuss how these identities are different from the identities of activist and vocal Muslims.

T1  - Exploring citizenship spheres of inclusion/exclusion: rights as 'potential for power'
AN  - 907925917; 201124621
AB  - Ariely examines the logic of inclusion/exclusion involved in the allocation of social, political and cultural rights to minorities. He argues that the unequal allocation of rights is determined by the degree of potential power inherent in the various types of rights, and that rights with more potential power, such as political and cultural representation rights, challenge the dominant group's position more strongly than rights to social welfare and cultural autonomy. Minorities are included at a higher level in spheres of rights with low potential power, and at a lower level in spheres of rights with higher potential power. He uses the case of the Arab citizens of Israel to illustrate the thesis, reviewing institutional practices of inclusion/exclusion as well as the attitudes of Israeli Jews towards the allocation of different rights as reflected in three attitudinal surveys. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From emigrant Spain to immigrant Spain
AN  - 902079241; 201122209
AB  - Spain is undergoing a process of intense demographic change towards a more diverse society brought about by massive immigration over the last decade that includes a high proportion of Latin Americans. Pejoratively dubbed 'sudacas', they are moving in the opposite direction to the Spanish who went to Latin America 100 years ago. Multicultural Spain has two main facets: the historical regional minorities in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, elements of which have waged struggles for national autonomy; and the recent immigrant minorities, notably the Latin Americans, North Africans and Romanians.

T1  - A Century of Scottish Emigration to New Zealand
AN  - 1531932760; 201423286
AB  - The Scots have always been a migratory people and by the nineteenth century that wanderlust had begun to take significant numbers of them to the Antipodes. Although only a small proportion of Scottish migrants went to New Zealand, they constituted between 20 and 30% of the colony's British-born settlers in the nineteenth century, and the legacy of their settlement is pervasive and persistent. This overview begins by surveying the aspirations of the migrants, in particular whether they left unwillingly or enthusiastically. It goes on to examine the mechanisms by which they effected their relocation, notably through the lens of recruitment agencies. It addresses the relationship between their expectations and experiences of settlement and sojourning, and ends by scrutinising the ways in which they chose to cultivate -- or shed -- their ethnic identity during the century after 1840. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'It's a Long Way To the Bottom': The Insignificance of 'the Scots' in Australia
AN  - 1531931234; 201423351
AB  - Australian historians have been reluctant to recognize the significance of Scottish immigration and immigrants. And, until relatively recently, Scottish historians were also indifferent, possibly because Canada and New Zealand seemed more Scottish. It is thus worthwhile to ponder the ways in which Australian (and Scottish) historians have approached Scottish migration to and settlement in Australia. Neglected aspects of the Scottish experience in Australia are exposed and overexposed aspects questioned. Some of the former include the twentieth century, radical politics, sport and popular music; the latter include the nineteenth century, God and Mammon. Despite the alleged invisibility of 'the Scots' in Australia as a group, Scots have consistently been very visible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bringing together acculturation theory and intergroup contact theory: Predictors of Flemings' expectations of Turks' acculturation behavior
AN  - 1417523620; 201332249
AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moiese, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

T1  - Home is Another Country: Ethnic Identification in Philippine Homeland Tours
AN  - 862595837; 201109641
AB  - Using data based mainly on 29 in-depth interviews with participants from three Philippine homeland tours, I conceptualize the process of ethnic identification through homeland tourism more precisely as the adoption of strategies aimed at symbolically demarcating grounds for informants' belonging in the Philippines as Americans. This conceptualization highlights ethnic identification as a problem, one that must be "worked on" insofar as claims to ethnic identity must be substantiated. It is also a problem insofar as this work of belonging is displaced and misrecognized. In working to establish a connection with the homeland, I argue that my informants are working out their belonging in America within the terms of distinction set by multiculturalism.

T1  - Transforming Livelihoods and Assets through Participatory Approaches: The Kudumbashree in Kerala, India
AN  - 907926840; 201124622
AB  - This article explores to what extent decentralized structures can contribute to asset accumulation among disadvantaged groups, and improving livelihood choices. The process of asset accumulation is tied to the wider context of participatory institutions and opportunities within which social actors can transform assets into meaningful livelihood outcomes. Given its level of social development and civil society in the Indian state of Kerala, the Kudumbashree Initiative, an innovative community-based, decentralized participatory structure aims to build meaningful forms of assets at grassroots levels. Such participatory public action, based on social relationships as well as the combined efforts of the state and grassroots community organizations may provide valuable lessons for developing asset accumulation strategies.

T1  - Civil Society Contributions to the Work of the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities
AN  - 896165433; 201120098
AB  - As a conflict prevention institution of 'quiet diplomacy', the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) is not associated, at a first glance, with civil society. This article analyses the working methods of the HCNM and demonstrates the all but irrelevant contribution of civil society to the successful implementation of the HCNM mandate. The paper first identifies the categories of civil society mostly involved with the work of the HCNM and then illustrates the different forms of involvement of each of them. It focuses, in particular, on two important instruments of the HCNM 'toolbox', the project work and the elaboration of general recommendations, looking at the essential role played by civil society actors. It concludes by maintaining that the role of the conflict prevention mandate of the HCNM has evolved significantly since his early years and that such evolution has effected (and was in turn affected by) substantial contribution from the side of civil society. As a result, a structural triangle of conflict-prevention comprising the HCNM, national authorities and civil society is emerging as reference, even if the balance among the three actors is defined separately in each individual case.

Secondly, it attempts to unpick the intimate connection between that material institution & the ethnic & national identities of individuals. Finally, it investigates a dissonance discovered between the bureaucratic state recognition of citizenship & imaginations of that status among interviewees, the 'identities of citizenship' occupied at the local level. The paper demonstrates the significance of subject positionality, economies of power & the 'dialogic' nature of ethnic identity formation, & discusses the complex emotional ordering of belonging they collectively construct.

T1  - African Americans' Lay Theories About the Detection of Prejudice and Nonprejudice
AN  - 856402938; 201106966
AB  - Two studies examine African Americans' perceptions of prejudice and nonprejudice in Whites and their perceptions of Whites' impression management behaviors related to prejudice. Responses to open-ended questions about what makes them think a person is and is not prejudiced and general advice for Whites were collected from a total of 236 African American university students. The most common behaviors listed that indicated prejudice included name calling and stereotyping. Indications of nonprejudice included positive behaviors (smiling, helping), equal treatment, and seeking out interaction with minorities. Respondents also advised Whites to be authentic. Results also indicated that common impression management behaviors by Whites may backfire. Results are discussed in terms previous research and the complicated nature of interracial interactions.

T1  - U.S. Immigration Policy and the Mobility of Mexicans (1882-2005)
AN  - 1221413801; 201243968
AB  - Mexicans constitute the largest immigrant group in the United States. This article reviews history to examine the impact of U.S. immigration policy on the development of migration patterns from Mexico between 1882 and 2005. Despite the large number of Mexicans who have been admitted as immigrants, for several decades U.S. immigration policy sought to construct the Mexican immigrant as a temporary worker; however, recent legislation has established a more permanent migration pattern, currently involving seven million undocumented persons. The burden of more than a hundred years of U.S. immigration policy should grant undocumented Mexican immigrants special access to legal permanent residency. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural Identity Treat: The Role of Cultural Identifications in Moderating Closure Responses to Foreign Cultural Inflow
AN  - 1023025674; 201223926
AB  - Political theorists of globalization have argued that foreign inflows to a society can give rise to collective-identity closure-social movements aiming to narrow the in-group, and exclude minorities. In this research we investigate whether exposure to the mixing of a foreign culture with one's heritage culture can evoke need for closure, a motive that engenders ethnocentric social judgments. On the basis of a proposed identity threat mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to situations mixing foreign and heritage cultures would evoke need for closure for individuals with low foreign identification but not those with high foreign identification. An experiment with Hong Kong Chinese students varied linguistic and visual cues of Western and Chinese culture and found, as predicted, that exposure to mixed Western/Chinese conditions elevated need for closure for those low in Western identification but not those high in Western identification.

T1  - The Attitude-Behavior Linkage in Behavioral Cascades
AN  - 754040474; 201049607
AB  - The assumption that individual behavior has an antecedent evaluative foundation is an important component of theories in sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. In its simplest form, the antecedent evaluation is a positive or negative attitude toward an object that may affect an individual's object-related behavior. This attitude may be influenced by the attitudes of other persons. The occurrence of such endogenous interpersonal influences, in which persons' attitudes are affected by other persons' attitudes, is among the basic postulates of social psychology. The present article advances work on the attitude-behavior linkage in behavioral cascades by jointly considering two theories: the theory of reasoned-planned action, which emphasizes the deliberative foundations of individuals' object-related behaviors, and social influence network theory, which emphasizes the group dynamics involved in the formation of individuals' attitudes.

T1  - 'Many Nice People': the nation-state, post-Fordism, and the policy norm of flexible ethnic relations in Estonia
AN  - 743055515; 201043245
AB  - This article uses historical research and ethnographic fieldwork to ask how policymakers interpret historical, political, and economic factors to construct inter-ethnic communities that would bring security and economic growth to an enlarged European Union (EU). Focusing on post-Soviet Estonia's ethnic integration policy, the article argues that 'flexibility' applies not only to post-Fordist, individualized subjects, but also to relations between subjects of different nationalities that policymakers want to form organically in service sector employment. The article explains how this policy construction emerged in light of Estonia's historical trajectory from 1991 to 2001 and demonstrates how it conceptually resolved the fundamental tension between the territorialized nation-state and deterritorialized global capitalism. A visual media campaign entitled 'Many Nice People: Integrating Estonia' captured the essence of this construction, which obscured how the Estonian nation-state marginalized minorities while integrating into the EU.

T1  - Sickness Absence among Immigrants in Norway, 1992--2003
AN  - 743044529; 201031609
AB  - Utilizing register panel data (1992--2003), in this article we study long-term sickness absence among immigrants and ethnic Norwegians (n = 200,022). The data contain detailed information on socio-economic background, labour market participation and social insurance benefits for all individuals aged between 16 and 67 years residing in Norway. We present four main findings: (1) There is no difference in sickness absence between ethnic Norwegians and immigrants from the other Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe after controlling for demographic, socio-economic and labour market factors; (2) the sickness absence rates are higher among individuals from Asia (men and women) and Africa (men), and lower among men from North America and Oceania compared with ethnic Norwegians; (3) second-generation immigrants share the same level of sickness absence as ethnic Norwegians; (4) residence time has a curve-linear effect (reversed U-shape) on sickness absence for most immigrant groups. We discuss the findings in relation to the reason for emigrating, health risks related to immigration, social exclusion and norms towards sickness absence.

T1  - A longitudinal examination of the role of stereotype threat and racial climate on college outcomes for minorities at elite institutions
AN  - 1417522215; 201331897
AB  - This paper employs hierarchical linear models to explore the long-term effects of stereotype threat on college outcomes for students in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen. Performance burden was negatively related to both grades and social satisfaction with college. Social satisfaction with college was also significantly impacted by students' perception of the campus racial climate. This paper examines the combined impact of performance burden, campus racial climate, cumulative GPA, and social life satisfaction early in college on 4 year graduation rates. Overall, while there are large initial differences in the likelihood of graduating on time for black and Hispanic students relative to whites, these differences are completely explained by assessments of campus racial climate, social life satisfaction, and grades. The findings suggest that interventions to reduce stereotype threat and improve the racial atmosphere on campus may go a long way towards reducing -- and in some cases eliminating -- disparities between racial/ethnic groups in college outcomes.

T1  - Housing Experiences of Turkish (Im)migrants in Berlin and Istanbul: Internal Differentiation and Segregation
AN  - 60337778; 201012026
AB  - This paper presents the findings of a comparative qualitative study of Turks who migrated to Istanbul from elsewhere in the country, and Turks who immigrated to Berlin. The main objective of the study is to describe and explain the segregation process affecting Turks in both cities. As the paper focuses on the process of segregation, the article follows the three basic stages along which the history of Turkish (im)migration to Germany and Istanbul has proceeded: the labour migrant stage, the family reunification stage and the settlement stage. Voices of (im)migrants are presented throughout the paper by reflecting their perceptions, values, experiences and dilemmas. The paper argues that internal differences within immigrant groups deserve more attention in order to better understand why some of them, despite being able to afford it, do not move out of concentration areas for better housing opportunities. In this context, the paper focuses on the internal cultural differentiation of Turkish migrants in Istanbul and Turkish immigrants in Berlin, with particular reference to their highly divergent religious understandings. We argue that conservatism-especially when it takes its roots from Islamism-has played an important role in shaping the residential preferences and choices of individuals.

T1  - Why Don't We Practice What We Preach? A Meta-Analytic Review of Religious Racism
AN  - 1928179681
AB  - A meta-analytic review of past research evaluated the link between religiosity and racism in the United States since the Civil Rights Act. Religious racism partly reflects intergroup dynamics. That is, a strong religious in-group identity was associated with derogation of racial out-groups. Other races might be treated as out-groups because religion is practiced largely within race, because training in a religious in-group identity promotes general ethnocentrism, and because different others appear to be in competition for resources. In addition, religious racism is tied to basic life values of social conformity and respect for tradition. In support, individuals who were religious for reasons of conformity and tradition expressed racism that declined in recent years with the decreased societal acceptance of overt racial discrimination. The authors failed to find that racial tolerance arises from humanitarian values, consistent with the idea that religious humanitarianism is largely expressed to in-group members. Only religious agnostics were racially tolerant.
