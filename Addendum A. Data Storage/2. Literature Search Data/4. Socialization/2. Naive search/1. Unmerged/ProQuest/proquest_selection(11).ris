T1  - Lay theories of networking ability: Beliefs that inhibit instrumental networking
AN  - 2446021662
AB  - While touting the importance of building effective networks, scholars have paid far less attention to why so many people feel so ambivalent or conflicted about instrumental networking, and what can be done to change such attitudes. The present research provides the first empirical test of a novel theory, which argues that people are more likely to disengage from networking if they hold a "fixed theory" of networking ability-believing that how well one networks is fixed or innate rather than learned through effort-which triggers negative attitudes toward moral and instrumental aspects of networking. To test this argument, we first develop and validate a Lay Theory of Networking Ability scale (Study 1) and show that this scale predicts people's attendance in networking events over a 6-week period (Study 2). Next, we show that lay theories can be experimentally manipulated, with consequences for attendance in networking events over a 4-week period (Study 3) as well as people's affective experiences in networking events (Study 4). In all, the present research contributes to our understanding of the motivational psychology of networking by highlighting the importance of beliefs as an understudied construct in the networks literature and by introducing methods to measure and manipulate them.

T1  - PMTCT Option B+ 2012 to 2018 — Taking stock: barriers and strategies to improve adherence to Option B+ in urban and rural Uganda
AN  - 2432835809
AB  - Since 2012, PMTCT Option B+ has been recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce vertical transmission but numerous adherence challenges remain. We conducted a qualitative study at baseline using six focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews to explore knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and challenges towards the Option B+ strategy for PMTCT among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women and health workers engaged in Uganda’s national Option B+ PMTCT programme. Data were analysed using a thematic approach to capture latent and manifest content with the social ecological model as a theoretic foundation in order to make contextual sense of key stakeholders’ needs for an effective Option B+ intervention.Overall, among all study participants, we found multi-level barriers to adhering to Option B+ cutting across all levels of the social ecological model. In line with the model, our study revealed barriers at personal, relational, organizational and societal levels. Some personal beliefs such as that the baby’s health is more important that the mother’s, organizational (negative attitudes and behaviour of health workers), structural such as poverty, work conflicts, fear and lack of disclosure related to community stigma were all critical obstacles to women adhering to the Option B+ programme. We found that both health workers and participants in the programme have a relatively clear understanding of the benefits of adhering to their treatment; though a more nuanced understanding and thus emphasis in counselling on side effects, is critical to helping patients adhere.

T1  - Adolescents’ experiences and perceptions of dementia
AN  - 2421211993
AB  - Objectives: There is a lack of understanding about how adolescents perceive dementia, and what their dementia related experiences are. Without such information, it is hard to make a case for the need to raise awareness of dementia in adolescents, and the best strategies to achieve this.Methods: In a cohort of 901 adolescents (aged 13–18) from the South East of England, we explored what the experiences and perceptions of dementia were using a series of questionnaires. Descriptive data of individual items were reported, comparing differences between genders.Results: The adolescents within this study tended to have positive or neutral attitudes towards dementia, though there was evidence that a proportion of adolescents had misconceptions or held negative attitudes (e.g. 28.5% of adolescents disagreed with the statement ‘In general, I have positive attitudes about people with dementia’). We also identified that the adolescents had a range of experiences of dementia including providing some form of care for someone with dementia (23.2%), though most had indirect contact with dementia through TV and movies (77.3%), or adverts (80.2%). Females nearly always had better attitudes towards dementia and had significantly more contact with dementia.Conclusions: Considering that adolescents are already forming negative attitudes and misconceptions of dementia, it is important that we raise awareness about dementia in this age group.

T1  - Less human, more to blame: Animalizing poor people increases blame and decreases support for wealth redistribution: GPIR
AN  - 2407985159
AB  - Increasing economic inequality adversely affects groups with low socioeconomic status (low-SES). However, many people are opposed to wealth redistribution policies. In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants’ SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.

T1  - Don’t Put Words in My Mouth: Self-appointed Speaking-for Is Testimonial Injustice Without Prejudice
AN  - 2391187272
AB  - In this paper, I will characterize a phenomenon I call ‘self-appointed speaking-for’, and show how it constitutes a counter-example to Miranda Fricker’s definition of testimonial injustice (TI), expanding our understanding of the category. Self-appointed speaking-for occurs when one speaks on behalf of or in place of another individual or group without their authorization. It is the sort of phenomenon that occasions complaints like, ‘You put words in my mouth’; that happens when someone else answers a question directed at you; or when someone purports to represent the perspective of a group they are not affiliated with or entitled to represent. I argue that this is a central case of Fricker’s testimonial injustice, on the grounds that it inflicts the same harms as other kinds of TI — particularly demeaning someone in their capacity as a giver of knowledge — in a way that is both epistemically and ethically culpable. TI is wrong not only for the harms it generates but also because its cause — prejudice — is ethically wrong and bad epistemic practice. As I show, self-appointed speaking-for is wrong for the same reasons as prejudice is, no matter what motivates it.

T1  - Experiences and effects of HIV-related stigma among youth living with HIV/AIDS in Western Uganda: A photovoice study
AN  - 2394533713
AB  - HIV-related stigma has been identified as a significant stressor affecting Quality of Life of Youth Living With HIV/AIDS (YLWHA). Gaining a contextualized understanding of how this stigma is experienced by YLWHA in Western Uganda is crucial in addressing it in this group and setting. In this study, we explored the lived experiences of YLWHA with HIV-related stigma. Photovoice was used to gain insight into the lived experiences of HIV-related stigma in 11 YLWHA (15–19 years), purposively selected from a hospital-based peer support group. Group interview transcripts, notes and photographs were subjected to phenomenological hermeneutic analysis. Encounters with enacted, anticipated and internalized stigmas and their myriad sequels were prevalent in the photos and narratives of participants. Our findings were categorized and presented in 5 main themes that were identified through the analysis: being devalued, experiencing fear, experiencing injustices, feeling lonely, and lacking future perspectives. HIV-related stigmas were experienced in various socio-ecological domains but predominantly in homes and schools that ought to be supportive surroundings for youths. A multilevel approach, targeting the entire society where the root causes of stigma can be found and specific contexts like schools and homes where youth are confronted with stigma on a daily basis is proposed for a wholistic intervention.

T1  - A large-scale test of the link between intergroup contact and support for social change
AN  - 2391206105
AB  - Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size—and at times, direction—of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change—willingness to work in solidarity— that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.Using data from 69 countries, Hässler et al. show that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups, but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Ageism Amplifies Cost and Prevalence of Health Conditions
AN  - 2348883500
AB  - Background and Objectives The persistent status of ageism as one of the least acknowledged forms of prejudice may be due in part to an absence of quantifying its costs in economic terms. In this study, we calculated the costs of ageism on health conditions for all persons aged 60 years or older in the United States during 1 year. Research Design and Materials The ageism predictors were discrimination aimed at older persons, negative age stereotypes, and negative self-perceptions of aging. Health care costs of ageism were computed by combining analyses of the impact of the predictors with comprehensive health care spending data in 1 year for the eight most-expensive health conditions, among all Americans aged 60 years or older. As a secondary analysis, we computed the number of these health conditions experienced due to ageism. Results It was found that the 1-year cost of ageism was $63 billion, or one of every seven dollars spent on the 8 health conditions (15.4%), after adjusting for age and sex as well as removing overlapping costs from the three predictors. Also according to our model, ageism resulted in 17.04 million cases of these health conditions. Discussion and Implications This is the first study to identify the economic cost that ageism imposes on health. The findings suggest that a reduction of ageism would not only have a monetary benefit for society, but also have a health benefit for older persons.

T1  - Raising the curtain on stigma associated with dementia: fostering a new cultural imaginary for a more inclusive society
AN  - 2333552616
AB  - Persons living with dementia and their carers experience stigma. Stigma intensifies social exclusion and threatens health and well-being. Decreasing stigma associated with dementia is a public health priority across national and international settings and is a key component of National Dementia Strategies. Research-based drama is an effective public health strategy for reducing stigma and enhancing well-being. In this article we focus on survey data from an evaluation of a research-based drama called Cracked: new light on dementia. Our analysis illustrates the effectiveness of Cracked in reducing stigma by: decreasing health care practitioners' and family carers' prejudice, fostering critical reflection about relational practices, and fostering a commitment to individual and collective action to address stigma. Cracked is well-positioned to respond to urgent calls for culture change, which include reducing societal misconceptions and stereotypes around dementia and promoting inclusive and meaningful engagement of persons living with dementia across all levels of society.

T1  - Exploring U.S. Shifts in Anti-Asian Sentiment with the Emergence of COVID-19
AN  - 2635380834
AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019–June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

T1  - “You See the Very Sharp Edge of the Problems of Prejudice in Town”: Youth Service Providers’ Perceptions of a Regional Community Facebook Group
AN  - 2385917902
AB  - The prolific growth of social media in recent years has provided new forums which allow engagement in local town discussions; particularly via community Facebook groups. This study seeks to understand the role of community Facebook groups in a regional town in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia; particularly how they are used to portray youth, and their relevance to a grassroots youth justice reinvestment process. This research arose due to direct concern from a community working group. Seventeen semi-structured interviews, with 18 participants, were conducted with service providers in Katherine, NT. The data was then inductively thematically analyzed, resulting in six themes: staying informed in a regional context; vilifying youth and combating this; racism; impact on youth; tensions in positioning youth: right versus left; and adopting a strengths-based approach to youth. Community Facebook groups were noted as an important factor for staying informed in a remote context. As a key medium within the town, Facebook groups should be considered a source of community discussion and an appropriate avenue to influence community opinion. The racialization of community discussions about “problem youth” indicates a segregation issue in the town, which has been noted for many years. Community education and the promotion of the youth justice work currently being implemented in the town were considered key in changing mindsets and ultimately behaviors. Importantly, research and community development programs alike should consider the community Facebook group as a medium for positive social action.

T1  - When integration policies shape the impact of intergroup contact on threat perceptions: a multilevel study across 20 European countries
AN  - 2376776526
AB  - There is ample evidence of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact in reducing negative attitudes towards immigrants. Although the valuable role of institutional support, one of the initial optimal conditions for contact, has been demonstrated, the impact of actual immigration integration policies, as a manifestation of institutional support, remains unknown. In the current study, we examine how country-level migrant integration policies, assessed by the MIPEX indicator, shape the relationship between everyday contact and threat perceptions associated to immigration. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with European Social Survey Round 7 data from 20 European countries (N = 32,093 citizens). Everyday contact was related to less symbolic and realistic threat perceptions. Moreover, on the country level, tolerant policies (a high MIPEX score) were related to higher everyday contact and lower symbolic threat perceptions. Confirming that institutional support facilitates the effects of contact, a cross-level interaction revealed that the link between everyday contact and symbolic threat was stronger in high rather than low MIPEX countries. The pattern of results was partially replicated when contact quality and cross-group friendships were assessed, though integration policies did not moderate the effects of these intergroup contact measures. These findings extend the body of multilevel contact research and are crucial for application as they show that integration policies have the potential to guide national majority members’ perceptions regarding immigrants.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: Exploring how identity processes shape public attitudes towards Australian counter-terrorism measures
AN  - 2319170986
AB  - Counter-terrorism measures are often described as pre-emptive, punitive, and afford authorities exclusive and expanded powers. Yet they continue to attract public support. Why is this the case? A consistent finding in traditional crime control research shows a link between perceived threat from racial or ethnic minority groups and their perceived involvement in crime. This perceived relationship results in public support for punitive crime control measures for such groups. Similar connections can be made between terrorism and Muslims. It is thus possible that perceiving Muslims to be threatening may help explain enhanced public support towards harsh counter-terrorism measures. This study draws on survey data of a national sample Australian residents (N = 1199) to test this hypothesis. Findings show the importance of both identity processes and perceptions of Muslims as threatening in shaping support for punitive counter-terrorism strategies. Results also demonstrate how social identity can moderate the effect of perceived threat on support for such strategies. Theoretical and policy implications of this study are outlined.

T1  - The Perception of Indonesian Youths toward Islamophobia: An Exploratory Study
AN  - 2410495586
AB  - Islamophobia has been on the rise in the twenty-first century. Muslims from all over the world has been subjected to prejudice, hatred and fear based simply on their perceived religious affiliation. This is the new reality facing Muslims especially those living in the West. Scholars have debated this issue from the historical development of Islamophobia to the mistakes policymakers made in dealing with Islamophobia. It has been found that Islamophobia is the product of a systematic attack on Islam and Muslims by people who have an agenda to keep the world divided for their benefit. While this much we know, what is obviously missing in current literature is research from the perspective of non-western communities. Through the conduct of a focus group and thematic analysis of primary and secondary sources, this research aims to discover the causes of Islamophobia in Indonesia in the twenty-first century and its impact. With the rise of Islamic extremism, there has been a parallel rise in Islamophobia in Indonesia. Moreover, the study discovers that Islamophobic sentiment can be found not only among non-Muslims, but also among Muslims towards other Muslims. In combating Islamophobia, it is important for us to understand the new trend of rising conservatism in a country that prides itself with its own indigenous culture.

T1  - Direct and indirect effects of prejudice: sexism, information, and voting behavior in political campaigns
AN  - 2571083821
AB  - This paper examines the effects of gender-based prejudice on candidate evaluation and voting behavior. It uses a unique experimental design to test for direct effects of sexism on candidate evaluation and voting behavior, as well as indirect effects of sexism on these variables via the information that subjects seek out about women candidates. I find that subjects with higher scores on items measuring modern sexism are less likely to vote for female candidates, less likely to vote “correctly” when their preferences most closely align with a female candidate, and rate female candidates more negatively than their male counterparts. I also find that subjects high in sexism search for less information about women candidates and that less information search also leads to lower feeling thermometer ratings, a lower likelihood of voting for women candidates, and a lower likelihood of casting a “correct” vote for a woman. In sum, sexism has both direct and indirect effects on subjects’ voting behavior.

T1  - Speciesism, generalized prejudice, and perceptions of prejudiced others: GPIR
AN  - 2285045368
AB  - Philosophers have argued there is a normative relationship between our attitudes towards animals (“speciesism”) and other prejudices, and psychological work suggests speciesism relies on similar psychological processes and motivations as those underlying other prejudices. But do laypeople perceive such a connection? We compared perceptions of a target who is high or low on speciesism with those of a target who is high or low on racism (Studies 1–2), sexism (Study 2), or homophobia (Study 3). We find that just like racists, sexists, and homophobes, speciesists were both evaluated more negatively and expected to hold more general prejudicial attitudes and ideologies (e.g., thought to be higher on SDO and more prejudiced in other ways). Our results suggest that laypeople seem intuitively aware of the connection between speciesism and “traditional” forms of prejudice, inferring similar personality traits and general prejudicial attitudes from a speciesist just as they do from a racist, sexist, or homophobe.

T1  - Examining the racial-ethnic continuum and perceptions of police misconduct
AN  - 2258621443
AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

T1  - Inter-racial Gateways: The Potential of Biracials to Reduce Threat and Prejudice in Inter-racial Dynamics
AN  - 2148421057
AB  - We test the notion that the presence of a dual identity group, which partially shares both the ingroup and a relevant outgroup identity, can decrease intergroup prejudice. Previous research has demonstrated that such dual identity groups can act as a possible gateway between the groups that represent the respective sources of the dual identity. The current research applies this notion to the inter-racial context in the United States, focusing on the case of biracial individuals as having dual identities, and thus as potential gateways between blacks and whites. Specifically, we tested the prediction that exposure of whites to biracial individuals would decrease intergroup threat which in turn would decrease prejudice toward blacks. Findings from three studies supported this prediction and showed that the presence of biracial individuals reduced intergroup threat and prejudice among those most likely to harbor them (specifically, those high on social dominance orientation). We discuss the implications of our findings in terms of how this effect corresponds with current theoretical developments on dual identity, and possible practical social implications.

T1  - Religion in the Lives of Hindu Widows: Narratives From Vrindavan, India
AN  - 2236166106
AB  - Religion’s impact on society cannot be overestimated. In the multireligious country of India, it is prevalent in the micro-level interactions and practices of commoners and the macro-level strategies and policies of political parties. Religion thus holds power to make or break societal structures and practices. This article investigates the role of religion in the lives of widows living in Vrindavan, India, by analyzing 37 narratives. Religion was found to have a dual role. Through the sociological lens, it is among the major reasons for these widows’ marginalized and dejected condition, having been abandoned by their families and society. The sociological themes comprise interpreting the doctrine of karma to rationalize widowhood, the formation of negative attitudes toward widows, and religion as a source of exclusion. Conversely, through the psychological lens, religion provides them with the necessary psychological resources to cope with several hardships in their daily lives. The psychological themes comprise seeing misery as an instrument of God, developing a personal connection with God, surrendering to God, using religious rituals as distractions from misery, helping others, and conceptualizing Vrindavan as a place of Krishna and enabler of spiritual retreat. The linkages to theory and a model for religion in the lives of Vrindavan widows are also discussed.

T1  - Tanni Grey-Thompson - 'The one that got away': a theological analysis of foeticide, infanticide and the deviant Paralympic success story
AN  - 2178535253
AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession's negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games.

T1  - ‘Would it not be better to get someone out workin?’: ‘Safe prejudice’ against Polish workers
AN  - 2171670678
AB  - One recurring criticism of immigrant groups is their alleged failure to be employed and contribute to the host society. Here we examine how speakers mobilise a criticism that has attracted less research attention: that through their economic activity immigrant groups usurp others’ employment entitlements. Discourse analysis of data from seven focus group discussions about pre‐Brexit Polish immigration into the UK, involving 31 UK nationals, shows that participants accomplish exclusionary outcomes in two divergent ways. The first attributes qualities to Polish workers but also makes explicit the consequences of these attributions for UK nationals, rendering speakers’ investment in such claims visible. The second relies on the production of category pairs, within which claims can be made for the category that excludes Polish workers. This use of categories comprises ‘safe prejudice’, a form of prejudice not previously identified but which is less open to challenge than other forms of prejudiced talk.

T1  - A (Not So) Personal Matter: Understanding Disability in Kenzaburo Oe's Early Novels
AN  - 2318570147
AB  - The article considers three of Kenzaburö Öe's early novels and their representations of disability. Scholarship about A Personal Matter (Kojinteki na Taiken, 1964, trans. 1969), "Aghwee the Sky Monster" ("Sora no Kaibutsu Aghwee," 1964, trans. 1977), and "Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness" ("Warera no Kyoki wo Ikinobiru Michi wo Oshieyo," 1969, trans. 1977) has often emphasized their autobiographical aspects, principally the relationship between the nondisabled father and his disabled son. While it is true that the birth of Öe's disabled child, Hikari, in 1963, had a defining impact on his writing, the article widens the relevance of disability representation in these narratives to include consideration of the social, cultural, legal, and eugenic frameworks that construct negative attitudes about disability in Japan. The argument is that attitudes about disability in these narratives are more than a personal matter; in fact, their discussions of infanticide, monstrosity, and care reflect both the historically marginal status of disabled people in Japan and policies that sought to eliminate them from the family and body politic.

T1  - Primary Care Providers' Attitudes, Practices, and Knowledge in Treating LGBTQ Communities
AN  - 2307554801
AB  - Cultural competency in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) health care has been found to be lacking within various medical specialties, but no studies have compared competency among primary care providers. The authors compared 127 primary care providers' cultural competency regarding LGBTQ health using a survey that assessed providers' attitudes, practices, and knowledge. Overall, 78.0% of respondents agreed that they were comfortable treating LGBTQ patients. Yet many providers did not feel well informed on specific LGBTQ health needs (70.1%), on clinical management of LGBTQ care (74.8%), nor on referring patients with LGBTQ issues (78.7%). Overall accuracy on LGBTQ knowledge questions was 51.0%. This study revealed a lack of cultural competency and much need for improvement as primary care providers endorsed negative attitudes, biases, inconsistencies in clinical practice, and deficiencies in medical knowledge in specialty-specific ways. There is a need for greater LGBTQ-specific education to increase providers' comfortability and competency in the needs, management, and referrals within LGBTQ health care.

T1  - 'She will know that her mother's doing something for her': women with intellectual disabilities assuming the mother identity
AN  - 2209598878
AB  - This article explores the experiences of women with intellectual disabilities in becoming a mother. The presented findings are from a grounded theory research study with 19 women with intellectual disabilities from the Czech Republic. The findings are organised around external and internal factors affecting the women's assumption of the mother identity, with the most prominent being poverty of the participating mothers, negative attitudes towards their motherhood, and a lack of preparation for motherhood. There is a need for systemic support for mothers with intellectual disabilities, starting in adolescence with sexual education, and continued throughout adulthood, including programmes focused on skills development.

T1  - The Campus as Crucible: A Critical Race Analysis of Campus Climate in the Experiences of American Muslim Undergraduates
AN  - 2186801559
AB  - Background/Context: Muslim communities in the United States have increasingly been the target of the state security apparatus, virulent public discourse, and increasing cultural xenophobia. Since 2001, individuals perceived to be from Muslim backgrounds have experienced dramatically increasing numbers of racially motivated attacks. What is often called "Islamophobia," or anti-Muslim discrimination or racism, has continued to rise in the past decade. Muslim communities face an acute political and cultural attack in which their actions and words are increasingly scrutinized and questioned. College campuses have been particular sites of contestation. This article explores how Muslim undergraduates understand their campus experiences. Purpose/Objective/Focus of Study: I examine how Muslim students expressed feelings of isolation and alienation on their campus community in a context of state surveillance programs targeting Muslim students and communities. In particular, I explore student narratives of being conscious of peer suspicion. Further, I investigate how self-consciousness of their outsider status created an environment where Muslim students feel they must continually attempt to make their peers comfortable with their presence while also challenging dominant stereotypes of Muslims. This study gives voice to Muslim undergraduate students as they negotiate prejudices, scrutiny, and discrimination on college campuses. Setting: Data was collected in southern California because there is a critical mass of community, concentration of students, and number of political advocacy and service providers for the diverse Muslim communities in the region. Focusing on this age group allows for an examination of this specific generation's understandings of race, identity, and citizenship, because they came of age amidst a rise in discrimination and racism against those associated with Islam and Muslims. Data Collection and Analysis: Data was collected through semi-structured life history interviews and ethnographic observations of Muslim undergraduates in Southern California. The interviews spanned between three and five hours each and were conducted over multiple meetings with each participant. Drawing from a critical feminist framework, interviews were conducted not simply to garner data, but rather to allow students the opportunity explore their own experiences, analyze their histories, and engage in social analysis. The research utilized a multi-level coding scheme in order to understand individual meaning-making processes. Findings/Results: This study reveals that Muslim students often feel politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and do not feel that their peers and teachers engage with them as full members of the campus community. Implications: This study contributes to the growing body of literature that demonstrates the multiracial demographic of students who choose the term Muslim as a primary form of identity. This study reveals that Muslim students often felt politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and did not feel that their peers and teachers engaged with them as full members of the campus community. Colleges and universities must take proactive steps to engage Muslim students in dialogue about their concerns, fears, and questions about issues of freedoms and protections on campus.

T1  - Social dominance orientation as an obstacle to intergroup apology
AN  - 2171190187
AB  - Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) has engaged the interest of social and personality psychologists as it has deep implications for the psychology of intergroup conflict, particularly regarding factors such as prejudice and discrimination, as well as international conflict resolution. Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed how SDO relates to intergroup reconciliation. This study (effective N = 819) measured participants’ SDO along with their attitudes toward various governmental apologies to test the hypothesis that SDO is associated with unwillingness to issue intergroup apologies. The results showed that SDO was negatively correlated with supportive attitudes toward government-issued international apologies. This negative correlation remained intact after controlling for the effects of political conservatism and militarism.

T1  - Social psychological research on prejudice as collective action supporting emergent ingroup members
AN  - 2162391435
AB  - Why does social psychological research on prejudice change across time? We argue that scientific change is not simply a result of empirical evidence, technological developments, or social controversies, but rather emerges out of social change‐driven shifts in how researchers categorize themselves and others within their larger societies. As mainstream researchers increasingly recategorize former outgroup members as part of a novel ingroup, prejudice research shifts in support of emergent ingroup members against their emergent outgroup opponents. Although social change‐driven science results in valuable opportunities for researchers, it also results in significant risks for research – collective, scientific biases in the inclusion and exclusion of social groups in prejudice research that are not readily detected or managed by traditional controls. We present the Emergent Ingroup Model (EIM) to encourage reflection on shared biases, as well as to spark a broader conversation on how to strengthen our field for a rapidly changing and increasingly global world.

T1  - Shifting Societal Attitudes: Examining the Effects of Perspective Taking on Attitudes toward and Derogation of the Poor
AN  - 2160681535
AB  - People tend to hold negative attitudes about and derogate those in poverty to varying degrees, often relying on indivi-dualistic explanations of poverty that largely ignore systemic sources. This study (N = 208) examined a perspective-taking strategy that could be used to reduce distancing behaviors and negative attitudes toward the poor. Perspective takers distanced less and reported fewer negative attitudes than others. An additional finding was that men (n = 57) were more likely to derogate/distance than women, showed greater agreement with personal deficiency explanations for poverty, and reported stronger stereotypic attitudes toward people who are impoverished.

T1  - The roots of Bernard Lewis' rage
AN  - 2177043542
AB  - In a review of Bernard Lewis' 1986 book Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice, Richard Wolheim makes the suggestive remark that the subtitle is 'not strictly accurate for the book manifestly and by design gives prejudice priority over conflict' (Richard Wolheim, 'Insult', London Review of Books, 9(6), 1987, available at: https://www.lrb.co.uk/v09/n06/richard-wollheim/insults, accessed 6 September 2018). Wolheim here touches on a principal feature of much of Bernard Lewis' work on Islam and Muslim societies: in Lewis' writings, prejudice has an unmistakable regulative presence. In the late 1970s, particularly after the publication of Edward Said's devastating criticism of orientalism (Orientalism was published 40 years ago this year), pride joined prejudice as a driver of what became Lewis' rage against those who refused to see the history of humanity as a series of inevitable clashes of civilisations. As Lewis steadily lost his academic pre-eminence, pride seems to have turned into resentment, driving Lewis to take up residence among the American neoconservatives.

T1  - Colonial toxicities in a recursive mode
AN  - 2177041723
AB  - It is a privilege and pleasure to engage the close readings and thoughtful queries of the five commentators who contributed to this forum on Duress. They provide an opportunity to reflect on - and beyond - my own preoccupations, and thus offer a welcome challenge. Since Duress went to press Israel has proudly declared itself an apartheid state; the French press and public have once again, as both did 20 years ago, pronounced France increasingly free of prejudice and in multiracial harmony in light of its World Cup victory. In the small city of Nantes, 450 refugees from North Africa squatting with minimal access to sanitary facilities in the city's rat-infested central park are rounded up by riot police. Europe has rescinded whatever partial welcome it once granted to refugees, and heightened its ever more aggressive security apparatus. And with insidious petulance Donald Trump promises to shut down the government if he doesn't get funding for "his" wall. The United States continues to descend into Philip Roth's fascist nightmare (as fantasised in his novel The Plot Against America), resuscitating a policy of "child removal' - once a staple of imperial governance widely practised and now condemned across the world. One might argue that colonial conditions and imperial formations have little to do with these developments, but as both Duress and the commentators here attest, there is strong reason to disagree.

T1  - An exploratory study on the attitudes of elderly Finns towards Russian-speaking minorities
AN  - 2101290553
AB  - Research has shown Russian speakers in Finland are often victims of prejudice and discrimination. Utilizing integrated threat theory, this study investigated the extent to which threats are significant predictors of prejudice towards Russian speakers in Finland among a highly neglected research population - the elderly. This study also aimed at finding out which threat (realistic threat, symbolic threat, and negative stereotyping) was the most significant predictor of attitudes towards members of the Russian-speaking minority, and the extent to which men and women differed. In a sample of 90 participants, aged 65 and above, results indicated realistic threat and symbolic threat were not significant predictors of prejudicial attitudes towards members of the Russian-speaking community. Negative stereotyping however had a negative effect on prejudice. Moreover, contrary to previous research on prejudice, there were no significant differences between men and women on threat.

T1  - ‘When I don't have money to buy the drugs, I just manage.’-Exploring the lived experience of persons with physical disabilities in accessing primary health care services in rural Ghana
AN  - 2138605810
AB  - The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities recognizes the rights of persons with disabilities' access to health care, including primary health care (PHC). However, growing evidence indicates that individuals in rural areas generally experience health access issues, and these issues are even worse for those with physical disabilities. Knowledge about such experiences is critical for policy design and clinical practice to promote PHC access for persons with physical disabilities in rural areas. This study seeks to explore the experiences of persons with physical disabilities in accessing PHC services in the predominantly rural Upper West Region of Ghana. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 participants living with physical disabilities, and used both deductive and inductive approaches to analyze the data. Participants shared experiences at three broad levels: the health system level, individual level and health-seeking behaviors level. Within the health system level, we identified three main categories: service availability (presence of health facilities, deficient drug supply and lack of providers), acceptability (positive and negative attitudes of providers and perceived high and low quality of care) and accommodation (inaccessible health facilities and equipment). The experiences at the individual level included financial constraints and mobility to health care facilities. Health-seeking behaviors related to how the individual reacted and responded to access barriers, which included searching for traditional healing, resorting to self-medication, making sacrifices in managing their conditions and relying on spiritual means. The information provided in this study is potentially important to policy makers and PHC providers as it presents evidence on the barriers and facilitators to PHC access in a rural setting. In particular, understanding individuals' experiences and how they develop health-seeking behaviors to overcome access barriers will be critical for policy design and client-centered service delivery in rural Ghana and potentially other low- and middle-income countries.

T1  - Facebook news and (de)polarization: reinforcing spirals in the 2016 US election
AN  - 2019372483
AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.

T1  - What predicts anti‐Roma prejudice? Qualitative and quantitative analysis of everyday sentiments about the Roma
AN  - 2051119090
AB  - The present research focused on two primary goals: (a) identifying the content of sentiments about the Roma to which Hungarians are exposed during everyday family conversations, and (b) determining which types of everyday sentiments about the Roma most strongly predict Hungarian respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice. Content analyzing open‐ended responses from a representative sample of Hungarians (N = 505), we found that more than 76% of the respondents reported being exposed to negative stereotypes about the Roma, 27% to threats posed by Roma, and 16% to overt dehumanization of Roma; additionally more than 20% reported hearing no positive sentiments about the Roma in everyday family conversations. We then examined which negative and positive sentiments most strongly predicted respondents’ anti‐Roma prejudice (using measures of social distance and modern racism). Higher social distance scores were predicted by a lack of positive sentiments, whereas lower social distance scores were most strongly predicted by unambiguously positive sentiments expressed during family conversations. Higher modern racism scores were further predicted by sentiments expressing dehumanization, threat, and violence against Roma. Together, these results attest to the extremity of anti‐Roma sentiments expressed regularly by Hungarians, and suggest how exposure to specific sentiments may foster anti‐Roma hostility. Moreover, these findings provide guidance regarding the specific negative anti‐Roma sentiments that should be combated to enhance the effectiveness of anti‐prejudice interventions.

T1  - The role of threat, emotions, and prejudice in promoting collective action against immigrant groups
AN  - 2047416325
AB  - In two studies we assessed the role of distinctiveness threat, group‐based emotions (angst, fear, and anger), and prejudice on people's willingness to engage in collective action against immigrant groups. In Study 1 (N = 222) White British participants were either informed that in the next 40 years the proportion of immigrants in the UK is unlikely to change (control condition) or that there will be more immigrants than White British people living in Britain (threat condition). We obtained support for a sequential multiple mediator model in which threat predicted British people's willingness to engage in collective action via the emotions first and then prejudice. This finding was replicated in Study 2 with an Italian sample (N = 283). These results enhance understanding of when and why advantaged groups undertake collective action against disadvantaged groups by demonstrating that distinctiveness threats and emotions promote such actions.

T1  - Subjective nearness to death and end-of-life anxieties: the moderating role of ageism
AN  - 2017948081
AB  - Objectives: Subjective nearness to death (SNtD), or individuals' subjective evaluation of how close they are to death, has been demonstrated to be an important predictor for different aspects of the individual's aging process across the life cycle. However, the relationship between SNtD and anxieties linked with the aging process has not been examined among individuals who may be in the initial stages of experiencing the first physical and cognitive signs of aging. Thus, this study examined the association between SNtD and aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, the role of ageism, or negative attitudes toward older adults, as a moderator for these perceptions regarding the end of life has not been addressed. Moreover, we examined whether ageism serves as a moderator for the aforementioned association.Method: A convenience sample of 1146 Israeli participants, ranging in age from 45 to 65, filled out scales assessing SNtD, aging anxiety, dying anxiety, death anxiety, and ageism.Results: High levels of SNtD were positively associated with aging, dying, and death anxieties. Moreover, there was a positive association between ageism and the three end-of-life anxieties. Significant interactions demonstrated the moderating effect of ageism for the relationship between SNtD and both aging and dying anxieties, but not for death anxiety.Conclusion: SNtD is an important construct, which is connected to various perceptions and anxieties concerning the aging and dying processes. Moreover, while high ageism mitigates the positive association between SNtD and certain anxieties, the role of ageism is more complicated, and its negative aspects are discussed.

T1  - The promise to the Arab World: Attributes of U.S. President Obama in Arabic-language tweets: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2000683740
AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

T1  - The stigma associated with bereavement by suicide and other sudden deaths: A qualitative interview study
AN  - 2080989693
AB  - Quantitative studies have found that suicide bereavement is associated with suicide attempt, and is perceived as the most stigmatising of sudden losses. Their findings also suggest that perceived stigma may explain the excess suicidality. There is a need to understand the nature of this stigma and address suicide risk in this group. We aimed to describe and compare the nature of the experiences of stigma reported by people bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death, and identify any commonalities and unique experiences. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey of 659,572 staff and students at 37 British higher educational institutions in 2010, inviting those aged 18–40 who had experienced sudden bereavement of a close contact since the age of 10 to take part in an on-line survey and to volunteer for an interview to discuss their experiences. We used maximum variation sampling from 1398 volunteer interviewees to capture a range of experiences, and conducted individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews to explore perceptions of stigma and support. We continued sampling until no new themes were forthcoming, reaching saturation at n = 27 interviews (11 participants bereaved by suicide). We employed thematic analysis to identify any distinct dimensions of reported stigma, and any commonalities across the three groups. We identified two key themes: specific negative attitudes of others, and social awkwardness. Both themes were common to interviewees bereaved by suicide, sudden unnatural death, and sudden natural death. All interviewees reported the experience of stigmatising social awkwardness, but this may have been experienced more acutely by those bereaved by suicide due to self-stigma. This study provides evidence of a persistent death taboo in relation to sudden deaths. There is potential for anti-stigma interventions to reduce the isolation and social awkwardness perceived by people bereaved suddenly, particularly after suicide loss.

T1  - Making a difference in medical trainees' attitudes toward Latino patients: A pilot study of an intervention to modify implicit and explicit attitudes
AN  - 2070444316
AB  - Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities. This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness? We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014. Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures. Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos.

T1  - Attitudes Toward and Beliefs about Transgender Youth: A Cross-Cultural Comparison Between the United States and India
AN  - 1985282116
AB  - Using an internet-based survey, we examined attitudes toward transgender youth in the United States and India, two cultures with differences in conceptualizations of gender and treatment of transgender individuals in society, law, and religion. We found generally positive attitudes toward transgender youth in our U.S. (n = 218), but moderately negative ones in our Indian (n = 217), sample. Consistent with the literature on prejudice against transgender adults in many Western societies, general social conservatism in the form of religious beliefs and political ideology, gender-specific conservatism in the form of gender binary belief, and endorsement of environmental rather than biological causes of transgender identity were the best predictors of U.S. participants’ attitudes, although personal contact with gender and sexual minorities also played a role at the bivariate level. These findings suggest that the processes underlying prejudice against transgender youth are similar to those that foster adult-directed transphobia in that cultural context. In contrast, religion-based disapproval and environmental causal attributions were the best predictors of Indian respondents’ attitudes, whereas gender binary belief played only a minor role, and political conservatism and personal contact no role at all. Our regression analyses accounted for considerably more of the variability in U.S. than in Indian participants’ attitudes, highlighting the need for additional (qualitative) work to identify the factors that promote transprejudice in India. We discuss these findings in light of cross-cultural differences between the two countries in terms of our predictors and consider implications for efforts to reduce prejudice against transgender youth.

T1  - The Implications of Gender and Role Relationship Categories for Public Attitudes towards Social Workers in Israel
AN  - 2196657893
AB  - The purpose of the current study was to explore the association between gender and previous acquaintance with social workers (SWs) and between attitudes towards SWs. Attention was given to three categories of role relationships, reflecting respondents’ status with regard to SWs: (i) current and former clients of social services departments (SSDs), (ii) activists and volunteers at SSDs and (iii) people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. Data were collected in Israel by means of structured questionnaires among 806 participants aged twenty-one and older. The findings show that women have more positive attitudes towards SWs than men and rank them higher than do men for professionalism and effectiveness. In almost all parameters related to attitudes towards SWs (aside from appreciation), current and former clients of SSDs indicated more negative attitudes than volunteers and activists or than people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. The conclusions were that personal encounters with SWs, as part of the therapist–client relationship, do not necessarily guarantee better attitudes towards them. Additionally, based on the finding that men have more negative attitudes towards SWs than women, it is also important to promote men’s awareness and knowledge of the functions of SWs.

T1  - Religiosity and attitudes towards professional mental health services: analysing religious coping as a mediator among Mexican origin Latinas/os in the southwest United States
AN  - 1981732685
AB  - In this study, we examined the relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards professional mental health services. We further examined whether internal religious coping and external religious coping mediated both relationships. Results indicated a significant association with religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services, as well as external religious coping and internal religious coping. Results also showed a nonsignificant association with both religious coping and negative attitudes towards mental health services. Finally, external religious coping mediated the relationship between religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services for men but not for women.

T1  - Meta-analysis and systematic review of studies on the effectiveness of HIV stigma reduction programs
AN  - 1957220483
AB  - Objective The present study conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review on studies evaluating the effectiveness of stigma reduction programs in improving knowledge and reducing negative attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLHIV). Results Meta-analysis (k = 42 studies) found significant and small effect sizes in the improvement of the participants' knowledge of HIV/AIDS from interventions with (Cohen's d = 0.48, 95% CI [0.30, 0.66]) and without control groups (Cohen's d = 0.42, 95% CI [0.28, 0.57]). Significant and small effect sizes were found in the improvement of the participants' attitudes toward PLHIV from interventions with (Cohen's d = 0.39, 95% CI [0.23, 0.55]) and without control groups (Cohen's d = 0.25, 95% CI [0.11, 0.39]). Significant and small effect sizes were sustained at the follow-up assessments. Subgroup analysis showed that number of intervention sessions, intervention settings, and sample type significantly moderated the effect sizes in the meta-analysis. Findings from the systematic review of 35 studies indicated that most of the included studies showed positive results in reducing negative attitudes toward PLHIV and improving HIV-related knowledge. Most of the included studies tended to have low methodological quality. Conclusion The present meta-analysis and systematic review indicated that the studies generally found small improvement in HIV-related knowledge and reduction in negative attitudes towards PLHIV among the stigma reduction programs being evaluated. High-quality stigma reduction programs with multidimensional stigma indicators and psychometrically sound outcome measures are highly warranted.

T1  - “I have struggled really hard to learn Sami”: Claiming and regaining a minority language
AN  - 1947604998
AB  - This article sheds light on the issue of new speakerness via a case study focusing on one adolescent - “Elle” - and her efforts to claim and regain Sami, a national minority language in Sweden. Elle did not acquire Sami at home, but attended Sami school from first grade to sixth grade, where she learned to understand, read, and write the language. Ever since childhood, Elle has “struggled” to learn more Sami and to be acknowledged as a Sami speaker. It was only recently that Elle started using Sami actively in speech, reclaiming her Sami voice and breaking a silence to which she had been involuntarily submitted. A condition that for Elle could have resulted in language loss was, thus, by her efforts to regain the language, turned into a condition of language revitalization. This article shows how Elle’s narratives are linked to language ideologies and language policies in Swedish society, to negative attitudes towards Sami culture, and to discrimination. By learning and actively using Sami in writing and in speech, Elle exercises agency, and by taking the important step to start speaking, Elle proclaims her right to speak Sami and to her representation. The agency that Elle exercises by using Sami is beneficial for her own language development, but could also potentially contribute to the language revitalization of Sami and to the linguistic empowerment of other speakers/learners of Sami.

T1  - Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?
AN  - 1929389479
AB  - We hypothesized that the ethnically tolerant (i.e., people who are anti-ethnocentric and score very low on a measure of ethnocentrism) would perceive people with extremely incompatible values and beliefs as out-groups and would engage in discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Experiments among Australian citizens in Studies 1 (N = 224) and 2 (N = 283) showed that the ethnically tolerant perceived supporters of a message in favour of mandatory detention of asylum seekers as out-groups and consequently exhibited discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Study 3 with 265 U.S. citizens showed that, controlling for liberalism, ethnic tolerance led to prejudice against out-groups. This was replicated with 522 UK citizens in Study 4, which also showed that social identity, and not moral conviction, mediated the link between ethnic tolerance and prejudice. The findings suggest that the ethnically tolerant can be discriminatory, prejudiced and politically intolerant against fellow humans.

T1  - Issue Introduction: Identity Concealment: Multilevel Predictors, Moderators, and Consequences
AN  - 1910720929
AB  - Over the past 20 years, research on the experiences of people who are targeted by prejudice and discrimination has grown dramatically (for reviews see Major & O’Brien, 2005; Puhl & Heuer, 2009; Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009). This research has shown the power of stigma to affect many life outcomes including psychological distress, physical health, and academic achievement (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). The bulk of the research, however, has focused on visible stigmatized identities, primarily race and gender. In the current issue, we focus on stigmatized identities that can be concealed. Concealable stigmatized identities are socially stigmatized identities that have the potential to be hidden from others. Some examples include minority sexual orientation, history of mental illness, chronic illness, substance abuse, and a criminal record. Previous work has shown that people with concealable stigmatized identities experience many of the same negative outcomes as people with visible identities, despite the fact that the stigmatized identity can be kept secret. For example, adolescents with minority sexual orientation have higher rates of suicidality and depression compared to their heterosexual peers (Marshal et al., 2011); people with a history of depression have higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than those without depression (Bradley & Rumfeld, 2015); students with a history of mental illness who attend college are less likely to graduate than those without a mental illness history (Kessler, Foster, Saunders, & Stang, 1995).

T1  - A Qualitative Study of the Integration of Arab Muslim Israelis Suffering from Mental Disorders into the Normative Community
AN  - 1890005485
AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

T1  - Strengthening Purity: Moral Purity as a Mediator of Direct and Extended Cross-Group Friendships on Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1881438993
AB  - The present research investigated whether enhanced perceptions of moral purity drive the effects of intergroup cross-group friendships on the intentions to interact with homosexuals. High-school students (N = 639) reported their direct and extended cross-group friendships with homosexuals as well as their beliefs regarding the moral character of the sexual minority. Participants further reported their desire to interact with homosexuals in the future. Results showed that both face-to-face encounters and extended contact with homosexuals increased their perceived moral purity, which in turn fostered more positive behavioral intentions. Results further revealed the specific role of moral purity in this sense, as differential perceptions along other moral domains (autonomy and community) had no mediation effects on behavioral tendencies toward homosexuals. The importance of these findings for improving intergroup relations is discussed, together with the importance of integrating research on intergroup contact and morality.

T1  - Exploring representations of Black masculinity and emasculation on NBC's Parenthood
AN  - 2013187969
AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons ... bucks ... as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

T1  - Undoing female genital cutting: perceptions and experiences of infibulation, defibulation and virginity among Somali and Sudanese migrants in Norway
AN  - 1875133119
AB  - This paper explores the dynamics of change in meaning-making about female genital cutting among migrants from Somalia and Sudan residing in Norway. In both countries, female genital cutting is almost universal, and most women are subjected to the most extensive form - infibulation - which entails the physical closure of the vulva. This closure must later be re-opened, or defibulated, to enable sexual intercourse and childbirth. Defibulation can also ease other negative health consequences of the practice. In Norway, surgical defibulation is provided on demand by the public health services, also beyond the traditional contexts of marriage and childbirth. This study explores experiences and perceptions of premarital defibulation. It explores whether Somali and Sudanese men and women understand defibulation as a purely medical issue or whether their use of the services is also affected by the cultural meaning of infibulation. This study analyses data from in-depth interviews with 36 women and men of Somali and Sudanese origin as well as participant observation conducted in various settings during 2014-2015. It reports that although all of the informants displayed negative attitudes towards infibulation, cultural meanings associated with virginity and virtue constitute a significant barrier to the uptake of premarital defibulation.

T1  - 'Thinking ill of others without sufficient warrant?' Transcending the accuracy-inaccuracy dualism in prejudice and stereotyping research
AN  - 1877774268
AB  - Research on prejudice seeks to understand and transform inaccurate beliefs about others. Indeed, historically such research has offered a cautionary tale of the biased nature of human cognition. Recently, however, this view has been challenged by work defending the essential rationality of intergroup perception, a theme captured controversially in Jussim and colleagues' (2009) research on the 'unbearable accuracy of stereotyping'. The present paper argues that in its own terms the 'rationalist turn' in socio-cognitive research on stereotyping presents an important challenge to the prejudice tradition, raising troubling questions about its conceptual and empirical foundations. However, it also argues for the necessity of transcending those terms. By focusing on the correspondence between individual beliefs and the supposedly 'objective' characteristics of others, we neglect the historical and discursive practices through which the social realities that we 'perceive' are actively constructed and institutionalized. We mask their social origins, contested and perspectival nature, relativity, and relationship to wider structures of power. By implication, moving beyond the Allportian perspective that has dominated both the prejudice tradition and the emerging stereotype accuracy paradigm, we may now need to prioritize other kinds of questions. Reversing Allport's famous definition of prejudice, it may now be time to ask: How, and with what consequences, does 'thinking ill of others' become sufficiently warranted? How does such thinking become part of institutionalized relations of power and an accepted way of perceiving, evaluating and treating others? What should social psychologists be doing to challenge this state of affairs?

The stuttered, cleft-lipped, and autistic words of the protagonists are considered for the ways in which they dramatize the experiences and effects of linguistic ableism as well as authorial messages that may counter or uphold this form of discrimination.

T1  - Testing a contact intervention based on intergroup friendship between Roma and non-Roma Hungarians: reducing bias through institutional support in a non-supportive societal context
AN  - 1860088266
AB  - Although intergroup friendships have been shown to reduce prejudice, little research has considered whether interventions fostering intergroup friendship would be effective in highly prejudicial contexts. We conducted a quasi-experiment (N=61) to test whether a contact-based intervention based on intergroup friendship could reduce bias against Roma people among non-Roma Hungarians. Participants in the contact condition engaged in a face-to-face interaction with a Roma person, and responded to questions involving mutual self-disclosure. Through pre- and post-test questionnaires, we observed significant positive change in attitudes and contact intentions among participants in the contact condition, while these effects were not observed among participants in the control condition. Positive change was moderated by perceived institutional norms, which corroborates the potential of contact-based interventions.

T1  - Spanish Validation of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale in a Sample of University Students
AN  - 1829808737
AB  - The shortened version of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale (PPS) analyzes new manifestations of prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women. Specifically, this instrument consists of 16 items distributed in four subscales: values gay progress, positive beliefs about gay men, positive beliefs about lesbian women, and resistance to heteronormative expectations. The aim of the current study is to add new evidence about the reliability and validity of the scale. The scale is administrated to 348 heterosexual university students from Spain with a mean age of 22.62 years (SD = 7.63). Reliability and factorial validity estimates are presented. A four-factor structure is supported using confirmatory factor analysis (short version). Our results can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual diversity.

AB  - Scientific, security and social policy cooperation had fostered stability and innovation to improve the lives of the disempowered, including better collective interventions to tackle health inequalities, and there has been a period of careful scrutiny of the care systems and processes, and progress towards protecting the human rights of people living with mental illness.

A higher mortality in minorities is associated with experiences of discrimination in older adults 1 and area levels of racism, 2 although the same has not been shown in a younger cohort of Black women. 3 Low levels of segregation in the USA correlate with lower Black/White differences in mortality of infants and young adults. 4 Mortality, suicide, homicide/violence, and cardiovascular diseases are substantially elevated among sexual minorities in high-prejudice communities. 5 In the UK, discrimination is associated with common mental disorders. 6 Employment, social action and anti-stigma interventions including social contact rather than segregation help improve outcomes. 7–9 Better knowledge is needed on how social adversity (prejudice, discrimination, stigma, low income, socioeconomic position) influences cumulative risks of poor mental health 10–13 and biological mechanisms of disease, for example, by accelerated ageing, 14 epigenetics, 15,16 and explanations for higher rates of heart disease, 17 respiratory disease, 18 poorer outcomes of HIV treatment, 19 and experiences of pain. 20 Young people and children are also witnessing more violence and open prejudice, as well as being victims of it, and such experiences can become biologically embedded. 21 Encouragingly, early life experiences of adversity might be buffered by learning and education, reflecting neuronal plasticity. 16 This month's BJPsych contributes several new studies of mortality and potential mechanisms by which adversity influences biology.

Despite more people receiving psychological and pharmacological treatments, levels of common mental disorders remain constant, and a substantial proportion of people are still not receiving treatments that we know reduce premature mortality in those with mental illness. 22 Social and political divisions are powerful sources of discrimination, as are aggressive biological drives and instincts and motivational mechanisms related to limbic system and amygdala.

T1  - (B)Locked sites: cases of Internet use in three British prisons
AN  - 1774840829
AB  - Based on a qualitative scoping exercise in three British prisons, this article discusses digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that digital media in prisons offers for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. As they are currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, physically cut off from their communities, and unable to communicate with family and friends in ways that have become normal in society, we argue that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. Our results show that prisoners display high levels of both curiosity and enthusiasm as well as fear and reservation toward Internet-enabled technologies, depending on age and gender as well as the length of their sentence. On release from prison, they are not only faced with prejudice and poorer job prospects than the average citizen due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during incarceration may have compound effects and lead to supercharged digital and social exclusion. We argue that secure access would be highly beneficial to prisoners who pose a low risk to society, especially during the rehabilitation and release phases.

T1  - Tracing anxious politics in Amsterdam
AN  - 1786270061
AB  - In recent decades the Netherlands has seen the rise of anxieties regarding the present and future of the nation. De Koning explores the way such anxieties circulate and are taken up in various settings and by differently positioned people, using the 'notorious' Amsterdam Diamantbuurt neighbourhood as her vantage point. She focuses on engagements with the iconic figure of the troublesome 'Moroccan youth' in order to trace how such anxious discourses move from the national stage, to the neighbourhood and into the narratives of Moroccan-Dutch residents. While younger women contest discourses that frame their male peers as inherently disposed to crime, and instead single out overzealous policing, older residents grapple with explanations. They articulate an anxious belonging that differs markedly from the contentious narratives of the younger generation. These engagements give us a sense of how such publicly articulated anxieties interpellate differently positioned people, and feed into generationally specific senses of belonging.

T1  - Love thy neighbour? Exploring prejudice against ethnic minority groups in a divided society: the case of Northern Ireland
AN  - 2076970677
AB  - Northern Ireland has seen a rise in racially motivated crimes and incidents reported to police in recent years and, although this has been accompanied by intensified media coverage, this phenomenon has been the subject of relatively little research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically three theories that have been proposed to explain prejudice towards ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland; economic self-interest, social contact, and 'sectarianism as racism'. Using the 2013 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which contains new questions on contact with ethnic minorities, this study looks at attitudes towards Eastern Europeans, Muslims and a third category of 'other ethnic groups'. Results from multivariate linear regression provide evidence for all three theories but also show that the strength and significance of predictive variables for prejudice vary across the minority groups. The findings that there are different motivations for prejudice towards different groups can inform policies to tackle racism in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Broadening the mind: Beneficial effects of sojourn experiences and contact with visiting international students on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior
AN  - 1761734788
AB  - Opportunities for intergroup contact are particularly important for prospective teachers because they bear responsibility for an ethnically diverse student population. Using data from a sample of 330 students inscribed in Austrian university colleges of teacher education, we investigated the long-term effects of international student exchange on prospective teachers' motivation to avoid prejudiced behavior (MAPB). Both sojourning and domestic students' friendships with visiting international students (VIS) were evaluated as potential instances of naturally occurring intergroup contact that can affect students' MAPB. Sojourning students had an increased MAPB even nine months after returning to their home country. No effect was found for domestic students' friendships with VIS. Possibly, the quality of these friendships was insufficient to result in long-term prejudice reduction. Implications of these results are discussed, and the need to advance interventions that are appropriate to improve domestic students' contact with VIS is ascertained.

T1  - Does Anti-Hispanic Bias Motivate Opposition to Non-English Languages?
AN  - 1728660554; 201535385
AB  - Contemporary political debates about language policy in the United States focus on three primary policy issues: bilingual education in public schools, English-only legislation, and the access of non-English speaking citizens to political rights. Using the 'Multi-Ethnic United States' module from the 2000 General Social Survey (GSS), this article tests multiple attitudinal, behavioral, demographic, and contextual hypotheses for how Anglos and African Americans view bilingual policy issues. We examine the role of linguistic contact, self-interest, group threat, and discriminatory views of Latinos, finding that the latter-as measured by the 'Three Ds' (Derogation, Disrespect, and Distance)-are the strongest predictors of attitudes toward bilingualism. Distance (social distance from Latinos) is consistently significant, disrespect (doubts about Latino contributions to the United States.) is mostly significant, and derogation (Latino stereotypes) is occasionally significant. Also, political ideology and knowledge of a non-English language play important roles in the formation of favorable bilingualism opinions. However, the self-interest and group threat variables were largely insignificant. Taken together, these findings indicate the importance of understanding how policy views may be structured by opinions about out-group individuals and cultures. Language can serve as a proxy for immigrants themselves, as negative attitudes toward Latinos are associated with negative attitudes toward bilingualism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - U.S. college students' lay theories of culture shock
AN  - 1762012654
AB  - As researchers strive to identify the components of effective preparation for study abroad, it is also critical to investigate the beliefs and expectations about intercultural adjustment that students bring to these interventions. A questionnaire assessed the structure and correlates of 149 U.S. undergraduate students' lay theories of culture shock. Findings indicated that students tended to attribute culture shock to differences in the external environment, such as language, communication, and surroundings, rather than to internal affective or cognitive factors, such as poor stress management, identity confusion, or prejudice. The tendency to attribute culture shock to internal causes was greater for those with higher levels of cultural competence, whereas low travel experience and interest in foreign language learning predicted the tendency to attribute culture shock to external causes. These results are discussed in terms of implications for sojourner adjustment and intercultural training.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Straight, Gay Male, and Transsexual Parenting
AN  - 1667949186; 201509661
AB  - This study examined American attitudes toward transsexual and gay male parenting, compared to straight parenting. After reporting levels of transphobia, participants read a vignette regarding a couple seeking child adoption. Individuals high in transphobia perceived nontraditional couples as more emotionally unstable than straight couples and were less willing to grant custody of a child to the nontraditional couples vs. the straight couples. In addition, the transsexual couple faced more prejudice and discrimination than the gay male couple. Implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Leaders and Followers: European Pre-understanding and Prejudice in the Greek Financial Crisis
AN  - 1963405275
AB  - Drawing upon the principles of hermeneutics, Intercultural Communication analysts maintain that in meetings between cultures, understanding requires pre-understanding. Hans-Georg Gadamer, a central figure in modern hermeneutics, points out moreover that in the movement toward understanding it may be necessary to provoke an unnoticed prejudice. For as long as our mind is influenced by a prejudice, Gadamer explains, we do not consider it a judgment. This article, through an examination of variations in leadership expectations, attempts to provoke the unnoticed western prejudice that is preventing an effective European pre-understanding of Modern Greece.This prejudice, operating unseen by the West, first produced the Greek financial crisis and now threatens to drive Greece away from taking its rightful place in the European family of nations.

T1  - Reducing disablement with adequate and appropriate resources: a New Zealand perspective
AN  - 2059566005
AB  - This article presents the qualitative findings from a larger mixed methods study of the barriers and costs associated with disability in New Zealand. A social model of disability framework was integrated with an economic cost model using consensual budget standards to (1) identify key barriers disabled people experience in their everyday living and (2) develop consensus about the resources disabled people agree they require to reduce or remove them. Forty-nine people with physical, hearing, vision or intellectual impairment participated in a series of 8 impairment-based focus groups. The analysis identified inaccessible environments, negative attitudes, unreliable transportation and poor access to information as key barriers. However, lack of adequate and appropriate resources (e.g. equipment, modifications, support, transport and time) to address these barriers was the overarching obstacle to participation. The inclusion of time as both a barrier and a valuable resource is arguably the most important contribution of the study.

T1  - Challenging Social Attitudes and Making a Change: The Struggle of Feminist Organisations in Turkey and India against Incest
AN  - 1700674157; 201528259
AB  - While it has become easier to find statistics of incest and child sexual abuse and other such 'data' from countries of the Global South such as Turkey and India, academic analyses of the issue from the perspective of organisations fighting against it and supporting survivors remain scarce. The purpose of this article is to lay out the existing discourses on gender, family, childhood, innocence and virtue alongside the social and media explosion on the issue, in order to locate the contradictions in social commentary within and against which three feminist organisations function: Mor Cati Kadin Siginagi Vakfi [Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation] (Mor Cati) and KA-MER (Kadin Merkezi) Vakfi [Women's Center Foundation] (KAMER) in Turkey and Recovering And Healing from Incest (RAHI) in India. Based on interviews with psychologists, lawyers and activists, this article looks at how these organisations challenge the prejudices that allow such abuses to thrive, creating new methods of resistance against incest in the process. In spite of Mor Cat and KAMER being more involved in developing a feminist critique of the public discourse on incest and challenging existing laws on the issue and RAHI focusing more on mental healing of survivors, all three organisations provide support for survivors and criticise patriarchal structures in similar ways in their attempts to break the silence surrounding incest.

T1  - Homophobic bullying: evidence-based suggestions for intervention programmes
AN  - 2117399958
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of the basic factors of age and gender in homophobic bullying behaviour, in order that recommendations for the design of anti-bullying programmes specific to homophobic bullying could be made. Design/methodology/approach – In total, 475 fifth year students (ca. 16-17 years old) and 561-second year students (ca. 13-14 years old) at six secondary schools in the Republic of Ireland completed an English-language translation of a questionnaire previously used in a Norwegian study of sexual orientation and bullying behaviour (Roland and Auestad, 2009). Findings – No evidence of “age-related declines” were found in reports of either bullying or homophobic bullying. Males were significantly more likely than females to report involvement (as both perpetrators and targets) in both bullying and homophobic bullying. Practical implications – It was concluded that senior secondary school students, as well as their younger counterparts, should be involved in anti-bullying interventions; that males should be especially focused upon; and that programmes specific to anti-homophobic bullying, potentially targeting pre-adolescent students, should be supported. Originality/value – This paper suggests evidence-based priorities for intervention programmes specific to homophobic bullying, accounts of which have been, to date, absent in the research literature.

T1  - Incorporating Sociology into Community Service Classes
AN  - 1542001751; 201426674
AB  - Sociologists and instructors who teach about community service share an affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating sociological content into community service classes. The authors supplemented a community service course at a large public university with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest that this integration increased student understanding of the social structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served, sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

T1  - Attitudes towards and Knowledge about Homosexuality among Medical Students in Zagreb
AN  - 1650146193; 201504547
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate whether students in their fifth and sixth years of medical school in Zagreb have homophobic attitudes and assess their knowledge about homosexuality. A survey was conducted among fifth and sixth year medical students during the 2009/2010 academic year. The survey consisted of: general demographic data, two validated questionnaires - 'Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire' and 'Heterosexual Attitudes towards Homosexuality Scale' - and questions about personal experiences created for this study. The mean knowledge scores were X=14.8 out of 20. Furthermore, gender differences in attitudes were observed, indicating less negative attitudes among the female participants. The regression model was significant (ANOVA: Sum of Squares=38.065; df=17, Mean Square= 2239, F=10.6; p<0.001) with 38% of explained variance. The significant predictor variables that indicate lower attitudes about homosexuality score were female gender (beta=-0.14, p=0.015), sixth year of study (beta=-0.16, p=0.009) and more knowledge about homosexuality (beta=-0.48, p<0.001). Negative attitudes are present among the students; therefore, educational efforts should be included in the curricula of medical schools to diminish the negative perceptions of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.

T1  - The Influence of Time on Artworks: A Hermeneutical Reading of Holocaust Films
AN  - 1911178605
AB  - This article’s aim is to focus on the close relationship that exists between the notions of prejudice and historicity and the time in which a film director of genocide lives and the extent to which their temporality unavoidably colors their artistic response to a historical event, such as the Holocaust. In this regard, depending on such an event, a categorization of people will be offered: victims and survivors, survivors’ children who born after genocide, witnesses of victims and survivors, and, finally, people born after the genocide. In this way, according to the main argument of this essay, the time period the film director lives in relative to the event is one of the criteria for evaluating their artwork in virtue of the formation of their prejudices and of their approach to the Holocaust as a historical event. But it must be noted that this essay will not argue that films of the directors belonging to any of the particular categories are better representations of the Holocaust than the films of the others. Instead, it will be stated that there appears a two-stage linguistic gap among human beings when directors narrate their own experience or highlight the significance of the event per se.

T1  - Social Science as a 'Weapon of the Weak': Max Weinreich, the Yiddish Scientific Institute, and the Study of Culture, Personality, and Prejudice
AN  - 1541997912; 201426680
AB  - This essay examines Max Weinreich's efforts to turn 'culture and personality studies' into social and psychological weapons that could be used to combat the effects of prejudice. It focuses on language choice, audience, and purpose in the production of such knowledge by and for a Yiddish-speaking Eastern European population. During the 1930s, Weinreich led the Yiddish Scientific Institute, a research organization headquartered in Poland but affiliated with neither a state nor a university. He was profoundly influenced by a year spent at Yale and a trip through the American South visiting segregated African-American universities. In his 1935 study Der veg tsu undzer yugnt [The Way to Our Youth], Weinreich blended European, Soviet, American, and African-American research traditions to examine the effects of prejudice on child and adolescent development; he also considered the ways members of 'despised minorities' could use such science. In 1940 he fled to New York and in 1946 published Hitler's Professors, the first book analyzing the uses of the human sciences to advance Nazi state-sponsored antisemitism. In examining Weinreich's Yiddish and English writings, this essay explores the broader relationship of social science not only to state power but also to statelessness and powerlessness.

T1  - Two Signatures of Implicit Intergroup Attitudes: Developmental Invariance and Early Enculturation
AN  - 1463012637; 201345659
AB  - Long traditions in the social sciences have emphasized the gradual internalization of intergroup attitudes and the putatively more basic tendency to prefer the groups to which one belongs. In four experiments (N = 883) spanning two cultures and two status groups within one of those cultures, we obtained new evidence that implicit intergroup attitudes emerge in young children in a form indistinguishable from adult attitudes. Strikingly, this invariance from childhood to adulthood holds for members of socially dominant majorities, who consistently favor their in-group, as well as for members of a disadvantaged minority, who, from the early moments of race-based categorization, do not show a preference for their in-group. Far from requiring a protracted period of internalization, implicit intergroup attitudes are characterized by early enculturation and developmental invariance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Diversity of Voices: The McGill 'Working with Culture' Seminars
AN  - 1356434419; 23549711
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Cultural Competence in Action: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Four Case Studies              The Working with Culture seminar is offered as a course during the month long Annual McGill Summer Program for Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, attended by local and international participants each May since 1994. The article outlines some of the premises and pedagogical approaches of this clinically oriented biweekly seminar series with discussions and didactic teaching on cultural dimensions of mental health care. The course readings, seminar topics and invited speakers focus mainly on therapist client encounters constructed by the multiple voices with dimensions of psychiatric, social, historical, legal, ethical, political, systemic and intra-psychic domains. The dual leadership emphasizes the gaps and complementarity amongst voices, and it invites and supports a destabilizing decentering process and the creation of solidarities amongst participants. Applying a bio-psychosocial case study method, each 3-h seminar engages the participants in a critical dialogue on apprehending the enmeshment of social suffering with psychiatric disorders whilst examining the usefulness and the limits of cultural formulation models. The seminar working group and teaching approach acknowledges cultural hybridity as a dynamic process marked by continuous therapist attunement to uncertainty or 'not knowing' which implies a dethroning of an expert position.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Adolescents and prejudice: A comparative study of the attitudes of two European adolescent populations regarding the issues that are raised by increasing cultural and religious pluralism
AN  - 1417524522; 201332137
AB  - This study illustrates the reaction toward the cultural and religious pluralism of two adolescent populations, from two different European countries. The goal in this study is to relate prejudices regarding immigration to the socio-cultural features that in a given context shape the issues surrounding this subject. The hypotheses proposed indicate that the socio-cultural factors represent interesting examples of variation of the stereotypes and attitudes toward the phenomenon of immigration. A survey has been conducted in Italy and France on 1277 high school students (mean age 17.2) to examine two different contexts concerning the issues that are raised by immigration phenomena. Consideration of the contextual factors will enable us to understand why young Italians express prejudices focused on economical and social issues, whereas young French people have a prejudice driven by identity issues. In order to explain such a typology of prejudice we have turned to the social and cultural characteristics that the question of immigration takes on in these two countries. Let us remember that for a more in-depth explanation of the factors that shape intergroup hostility, variables at the individual level need to be put alongside those at the contextual level. This way of working will lead to a better understanding of the social genesis of prejudices. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Trends in Occupational Segregation by Gender 1970-2009: Adjusting for the Impact of Changes in the Occupational Coding System
AN  - 1318835005; 23055237; 23440734
AB  - In this article, we develop a gender-specific crosswalk based on dual-coded Current Population Survey data to bridge the change in the census occupational coding system that occurred in 2000 and use it to provide the first analysis of the trends in occupational segregation by sex for the 1970-2009 period based on a consistent set of occupational codes and data sources. We show that our gender-specific crosswalk more accurately captures the trends in occupational segregation that are masked using the aggregate crosswalk (based on combined male and female employment) provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using the 2000 occupational codes, we find that segregation by sex declined substantially over the period but at a diminished pace over the decades, falling by only 1.1 percentage points (on a decadal basis) in the 2000s. A primary mechanism by which segregation was reduced was through the entry of new cohorts of women, presumably better prepared than their predecessors and/or encountering less labor market discrimination; during the 1970s and 1980s, however, occupational segregation also decreased within cohorts. Reductions in segregation were correlated with education, with the largest decrease among college graduates and very little change in segregation among high school dropouts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ageism among College Students: A Comparative Study between U.S. and China
AN  - 1448996229; 201344825
AB  - It is often assumed that Chinese people tend to have a more positive attitude toward aging and old age than Americans, due to the cultural generalization of collectivism versus individualism. This study aimed to critically examine this assumption by using first-hand empirical data collected in a Chinese and an American university (standardized surveys and in-depth focus group interviews). Respectively, 980 college students in China and 332 college students in the U.S. were recruited for the standardized surveys; whereas two focus-group interviews in each country (4 participants per group) were conducted to collect more in-depth information. Contrary to the common assumption, this study revealed that Chinese students actually hold more negative attitudes toward aging and older people compared to their American peers. It was also found that females tend to hold more positive attitudes than male students across both cultures, though American female students hold more positive attitudes than Chinese female students. Chinese students' interactions with seniors are often limited to their grandparents whereas American students tend to reach out to non-grandparent seniors in larger communities. Chinese students' more negative attitudes toward aging and older people may be a result of a combination of educational, social, and economic factors-a higher level of age segregation (geographically, socially, and intellectually) and a lack of gerontological curriculum in Chinese educational system, the caregiving burden faced by the one-child generation compounded with lack of governmental support for caregiving, as well as the rising youth-oriented consumerist culture.

T1  - Changing the Culture of Migration? Attitudes towards Education among Former Basotho Labour Migrants to South African Mines
AN  - 1641424395; 201500275
AB  - Until late in the 1990s, employment for unskilled and uneducated able-bodied Basotho men on South African mines was usually available. As a result, the education of male children in most Basotho households was not prioritised. In the 1990s, massive retrenchments took place at the mines, resulting in many Basotho men being retrenched and repatriated. Most of those retrenched did not have any formal education and were generally unskilled. Many of the ex-miners believed that they were retrenched to make way for an educated workforce. Back home, they experienced problems getting employment because of their lack of formal education. These experiences, combined with efforts by the government of Lesotho and its development partners to promote education, have led to a change in the attitudes of the former miners towards education. Most of them now have positive attitudes towards education as they perceive it as a more secure and more sustainable means of getting employment and a vehicle for economic and social mobility. Based on qualitative data obtained from former mine workers this paper provides evidence that as a result of new realities, former migrants are developing positive attitudes towards education. The change in attitude towards education can however, only evolve into a change in the culture of migration if, over time, the benefits of education outweigh those of migration.

T1  - Translating Recategorization Strategies Into an Antibias Educational Intervention
AN  - 1433107785
AB  - This experiment explored whether the benefits of a complete recategorization and a dual identity might effectively be translated into an intervention program designed to reduce prejudice among European Portuguese and African Portuguese 9- to 11-year-old children. Participants interacted for 45 minutes in weekly sessions for a month. One month after the last interaction, measures were administered to the children. Results revealed that only recategorization reduced prejudice over time relative to the control condition. Consistent with a functional perspective regarding which representation would most effectively promote their group's goals, a one-group representation was more effective for the African Portuguese minority group.

T1  - Economic Prosperity as "Narcissistic Filling": A Missing Link Between Political Attitudes and Right-wing Authoritarianism
AN  - 1412576312
AB  - An expanded analysis of the origin of the correlation with economic deprivation found in the authors' representative surveys of right-wing extremist attitudes (such as racism, anti-Semitism, and chauvinism), focusing on the underlying dynamics in Germany and the historical aspect of National Socialism. The growing prosperity of the West German "economic miracle" of the 1950s served a psychosocial "filling function" to block the narcissistic damage caused by confrontation with past crimes and the sense of the nation's loss of greatness. As this prosperity vanishes for many people during the current economic crisis, the filling comes out and the narcissistic wound opens up. What emerges is both what lies underneath and what has been serving as a defense against it, which involve authoritarian dynamics. Initially, the metaphor of "narcissistic filling" will be developed through our analysis of group discussions conducted as part of our qualitative study (of 2008). The developed hypotheses will thereafter be introduced to our following representative survey (of 2010) and confirmed by means of quantitative methods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons?
AN  - 1095795026
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Confronting Hate: Heterosexuals' Responses to Anti-Gay Comments
AN  - 1373427388; 201328555
AB  - An online diary study was used to examine the individual and situational variables that influence non-targets' verbal and nonverbal reactions and responses to sexually prejudiced remarks. Results indicated that anti-gay comments were extremely prevalent in a college setting and resulted in a range of reactions and behaviors. Confrontation of the perpetrator was predicted by the perceived offensiveness of the comment, perceived social pressure to confront, and the number of close same-sex attracted friends. Additionally, those who confronted felt more satisfied with their responses than those who did not confront. Implications for future research and prejudice reduction strategies are discussed.

T1  - Gender, Religion and an Immigrant Minority: Jewish women and the suffrage movement in Britain c.1900-1920
AN  - 1567049527; 201437804
AB  - Middle- and upper-class Jewish women enjoyed less equality within their faith communities than Christian counterparts. They were represented in every strand of the suffrage movement, and in 1912 formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage (JLWS), modelled on similar Christian leagues. A study of the origins of the JLWS, and its relations with parallel organisations, shows religious difference to have been no barrier, and even conducive to, cross-denominational collaboration. The JLWS confounded (largely male) communal expectations that it would not influence London's East End, and would exacerbate prejudice against Jews. Post-1918, Jewish women were denied the level of equality within their faith congregations achieved by their Christian peers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Overcoming stigma: how young people position themselves as counseling service users
AN  - 1020054989
AB  - Increasing attention has been focused on adolescent help-seeking in relation to services aimed at promoting mental health and wellbeing. Much research reinforces the ubiquity of concerns about negative stigmatization by peers as a barrier to young people accessing services. This paper draws on interviews conducted with young people, who completed a course of counseling in school, to investigate how they managed and negotiated this. Drawing on positioning theory from discourse analysis, young people's accounts are analyzed with reference to the variety of positions they articulated and adopted. This demonstrates how they elaborated and reinforced virtuous problem-solver positions within broader discourses of individualization and normalization, and resisted positioning within a stigmatized mental illness discourse. Although focused on a small sample, the analysis offers potential insights into the ways other people may negotiate stigma concerns to access mental health resources, while also demonstrating the utility of positioning theory for understanding stigma and normalization.

T1  - Accessibility to micro-finance services by people with disabilities in Bushenyi District, Uganda
AN  - 2059577252
AB  - The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Ugandan Government identified provision of microfinance as one of its interventions. Despite the known connection between poverty and people with disabilities, it remains unclear to what extent this intervention includes or accommodates them. This study seeks to gain a better understanding of how people with physical and sensory disabilities access existing microfinance services in the Bushenyi District of Uganda. Qualitative and quantitative methodologies are used. The findings suggest that people with disabilities are not necessarily denied access to microfinance if they meet the desired requirements. These relate to adequate savings or collateral and perceived trustworthiness. These are seen to be key determinants of success and can be linked to impaired functioning relating to limited mobility, distance, poorer access to information and disabled people's own negative attitudes. Increasing access and utilization of microfinance services by people with disabilities requires formulation of financial policies that accord them special consideration. At the same time, improvement is needed in the knowledge, attitudes and skills of the people with disabilities themselves and also microfinance providers.

T1  - Contact, evaluation and social distance: Differentiating majority and minority effects
AN  - 1417520796; 201332133
AB  - Contact research has traditionally focused on reducing negative attitudes or emotions towards outgroups. In the current studies we focus on reduced social distance as an outcome of intergroup contact -- that is a person's desire to have increased contact with members of a group -- and investigate whether outgroup evaluation in associated with these generalizing effects of contact. Drawing on data from a large sample of secondary school students in Australia gathered from majority and minority group members the findings demonstrate that having contact with an outgroup reduces social distance to the group in general. However, for majority group members, evaluation of the minority group is a strong predictor of social distance and evaluation is also improved with intergroup contact. Importantly, evaluations of the outgroup play no such role for minority group members. The findings highlight an alternate model for understanding contact effects and suggest that reduced social distance rather than improved outgroup evaluations may be more important in understanding minority responses to contact.

T1  - A Tale Of Two Theistic Studies: Illustrations And Evaluation Of A Potential Program Of Theistic Psychological Research
AN  - 1221412142; 201245663
AB  - Two empirical research studies are described that illustrate the potential value of joining conventional social science and theistic religion in a theistic program of psychological research. The first study shows how a theistic program of psychological research tweaks the existing psychological research on the formation of God attachment to include a new assessment, experiences of God. The results of Study indicate that experiences of God are an important predictor of theists' attachment to God, even when controlling for parental attachment. The second study exemplifies how theistic ideas can lead to a new program of psychological research, in this case research on implicit attitudes toward faith and science, and can generate new scientific instruments such as the modified Implicit Association Test used in this study. The results of Study 2 suggest that education and training in psychology may lead theistic psychology students to implicitly endorse a secular stereotype that they consciously reject. Implications of the findings of both studies are discussed and the heuristic value of a theistic program of psychological research is explored. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Development and Current State of Youth Research in Turkey: An Overview
AN  - 1023029830; 201225938
AB  - This article aims to provide an overview of youth research in Turkey, from the building years of the Turkish nation-state to the present. It discusses two broad traditions of youth research in Turkey, namely, sociocultural research and psycho-pedagogical research. In particular, it addresses the representative scholarly discourses and the main research lines of Turkish youth research, with specific attention to domestic social context. Adopting a comparative perspective, it also aims to address how Turkish youth research relates to broader trends. Finally, it takes a closer look at the current state of youth research in Turkey.

T1  - Contact, Congregations, and Children of Color: The Effects of Interracial Contact in Religious Settings on Whites' Attitudes towards Transracial Adoption
AN  - 930687256
AB  - On multiple occasions research has substantiated a positive relationship between interracial contact in religious settings and Whites' attitudes towards interracial marriage, but would the same be true regarding other interracial family relationships? Moreover, would such a relationship hold true for both Protestants and Catholics? This study examines the effects of interracial contact in Protestant and Catholic churches on Whites' attitudes towards transracial adoption (TRA). Using nationally representative survey data (N = 986), bivariate and multivariate analyses are employed to determine how an increase in the percentage of racial minorities at one's church affects the TRA attitudes of Whites, while holding relevant social and ideological factors constant. Results indicate that Whites who attend the most uniracial churches are, ceteris paribus, significantly less likely to approve of TRA than Whites who attend churches with only a slightly greater percentage of racial minorities. These effects do not differ for Protestants or Catholics. Further research should be done to determine the extent to which significant social change can be fostered by interracial contact under certain positive conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - High School Students' Attitudes Toward Providing Girls Opportunities to Participate in Sport
AN  - 919901723; 201202214
AB  - In light of the increasing participation of girls/women in sport, we investigate the attitudes of high school boys and girls toward potential increased opportunities for girls' to participate in sport. There has been little research on high school students' attitudes toward girls' sport participation decomposed by gender and athletic status. We find that, on average, high school students are supportive of increased opportunities for girls to participate in sport. Girls are more supportive than boys on average. While there is no difference among girls by athletic status, male competitive athletes show the most negative attitudes toward opportunities for girls to participate in sport compared with male noncompetitive athletes. Lastly, racial minority groups express positive attitudes toward increased opportunities for girls to participate in sport compared with whites. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reclaiming Sami languages: indigenous language emancipation from East to West
AN  - 896199856; 201120877
AB  - The indigenous Sami languages of the Nordic countries and North-West Russia have gained official recognition after a long period of neglect and assimilation policies. In the context of positive changes in state or macro level indigenous policy and especially that regarding language policy, this paper investigates what subsequently happens at the grassroots or micro level. This investigation shows that despite more positive policies, there is a strong sentiment of defeatism with regard to Sami. Sami speakers face problems because of the lack of implementation of nationally decided laws at the local level, they encounter prejudice and neglect from other people, even in their families, and as a result they often experience difficulty in transmitting Sami to their children. Nevertheless, they also express belief in Sami and feel a need for this transmission, not only for affective reasons and for the sake of cultural maintenance, but also for instrumental reasons, i.e. to give their children better opportunities in the labor market where knowledge of Sami is necessary.

T1  - A Multidimensional Examination of the "Stereotype" Concept: A Developmental Approach
AN  - 862596063; 201109802
AB  - The present studies tested the hypothesis that the stereotypical representation of a target group is composed of several components. It was further hypothesized that some of the dimensions are more closely associated with the perceiver's group than are others. Finally, it was hypothesized that the structure & the foundation of the stereotype is related to the age of the perceiver. In two studies, Israeli children, ranging in age from 4 to 17 years, assigned stereotyped traits to target groups (Israeli, Arabs, Americans, Germans). The respondents were then given the opportunity to rate the traits on several dimensions including group evaluation, salience, homogeneity, uniqueness, & ingroup consensus. Respondents of all ages could use the multiple components to describe their stereotype. The results indicate that the specific target group affected the structure of the stereotype. The stereotype of older children was more likely to represent a prototype of the target group & be based on personal experience than was the stereotype of younger children. The implications of the results for understanding the formation & fluctuation of stereotypes are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Vocational Choice and Attitudes toward Welfare Policy
AN  - 1018350120; 201214662
AB  - This study examines the relationship between occupational choice and changes in students' attitudes toward the welfare state during their academic training. The sample included students from four faculties at Israeli universities: social work, sociology, economics and medicine (N = 1,429). The results of the study point at interesting trends concerning the acquisition of attitudes toward social policy: students from different faculties differ in their social policy attitudes prior to their academic training; only students who were exposed directly to issues concerning social policy during their studies demonstrate changes in their attitudes toward the subject and a potential positive change in attitudes is indicated in medical students' attitudes toward social welfare policy, but this depends on academic curriculum. The findings were explained in various ways. Theoretically, vocational choice theories can explain the differences in personal values and in attitudes toward social policy prior to academic training. Social theory such as social dominance theory may explain the differences in social power relating to the support of welfare policy. The findings indicate the importance of including courses concerning this issue in professional training, especially in the helping professions, and for future policy makers such as economics students.

T1  - In Their Own Words: Sophomore College Men Describe Attitude and Behavior Changes Resulting From a Rape Prevention Program 2 Years After Their Participation
AN  - 822521895; 201075356
AB  - The study conducted involved assessing students from a Southeastern public university during two academic years, after their participation in an all-male sexual assault peer education program. The study findings revealed that 79% of 184 college men reported attitude change, behavior change, or both. Furthermore, a multistage inductive analysis revealed that after seeing The Men's Program, men intervened to prevent rapes from happening. Participants also modified their behavior to avoid committing sexual assault when they or a potential partner were under the influence of alcohol. Implications for future research were discussed.

T1  - Moral Credentialing by Association: The Importance of Choice and Relationship Closeness
AN  - 1928318283
AB  - People express more prejudice if they have established their "moral credentials." Five studies explored the acquisition of moral credentials through associations with racial minorities, particularly close relationships that are personally chosen. Participants choosing to write about a positive experience with a Black person (Study 1) or Hispanic person (Study 2) subsequently expressed more preference for Whites and tolerance of prejudice than did other participants. In Study 3, the credentialing effect of choice was diminished when participants were given an incentive for that choice. Participants in Study 4 who wrote about a Black friend were more credentialed than those who wrote about a Black acquaintance, regardless of whether the experience was positive or negative. Study 5 suggested that participants strategically referred to close associations with minorities when warned of a future situation in which they might appear prejudiced.

T1  - Experiences of Young Bisexual Women in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace
AN  - 859361405
AB  - This exploratory study examined Topic threads in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace to examine how young biwomen self-identify in online exchanges with other bisexuals and lesbians, as well as what attitudes and beliefs about bisexuality emerge from those exchanges. Four Topic threads from three Groups suggested that young biwomen use social networking sites to connect with others and create inclusive communities for biyouth. Although acceptance of bisexuality was strongly endorsed by many, they were sometimes met with antagonism from their lesbian peers. Together with lesbian allies, they were able to challenge such prejudice but remain keenly aware of its existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Keeping the Doors to the Community Open
AN  - 1081869087; 201235313
AB  - Polls show that Americans of all races now believe that social class and national origin are more potent bases for discrimination than race. However, this assessment is rendered more complicated by (a) the high rate of exclusion of people on the basis of behavioral characteristics and (b) the strikingly disparate impact of such decisions on people of color. America's high rates of (a) incarceration in the criminal and juvenile justice system, (b) visa denials, detention, and removal in the immigration system, and (c) suspensions and expulsions in the schools all have the effect of excluding many Latinos and African Americans from ordinary life in the community. Although norms of inclusion are adaptive for communities, such an approach is intrinsically difficult to achieve. Attention should be given to (a) facilitation of the exercise of moral leadership and (b) design of settings that "demand" notice of, and care for, all participants.

T1  - Parochial geographies: Growing up in divided Belfast
AN  - 758123729; 201057861
AB  - This article explores the ways in which teenagers occupy and manage space in one divided community in Northern Ireland. Drawing on stories, maps and focus group discussions with 80 teenagers, from an interface area in Belfast, the article reveals their perceptions and experiences of divided cities, as risky landscapes. Teenagers respond to these risks in various ways, at times reiterating traditional sectarian prejudices and at times demonstrating resilience in coping with growing up in a risky location. In the process, young people develop strategies of resistance, which at times support, and at times undermine, the wider ideologies underpinning ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Desistance and Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders: Facilitation or Hindrance?
AN  - 754040178; 201052254
AB  - In an ideal world, there would be a seamless relationship between interventions that focus on risk factors causally associated with sexual reoffending and the subsequent release of, and ongoing support for, offenders into the community. However, emotionally fueled and uninformed public responses to news of released sex offenders, and the legislation such responses have inspired, severely hinder this process. Our aims in this paper are to review findings of research on community attitudes about sex offenders within a desistance framework. More specifically, we provide a synthesis of the current research literature on attitudes towards sex offenders. Second, we consider in more detail those studies that include community member samples. Third, we review interventions aimed at promoting attitude change amongst professionals working with sex offenders and finally formulate some recommendations for promoting positive attitude change amongst the general public.

T1  - How should intergroup contact be structured to reduce bias among majority and minority group children?
AN  - 754037282; 201049570
AB  - This experiment examined the effectiveness of one-group and dual-identity recategorization strategies on reducing intergroup bias among 180 European Portuguese and African Portuguese 9- and 10-year-old children. Results revealed that each of these recategorization strategies, relative to one that emphasized separate group identities, was successful in producing positive attitudes toward the outgroup children present during the session, the outgroup as a whole, and the outgroup as a whole three weeks later. Consistent with a functional perspective regarding which representation would most effectively promote their group's goals, a dual identity was more effective for the European Portuguese majority group, whereas a one-group identity was more effective for the African Portuguese minority group. Additional analyses explored a model of the process of generalization that formally links attitudes toward the outgroup as a whole to the attitudes toward outgroup members present during contact.

T1  - Reflections on intersections between cognitive and social psychology: A personal exploration
AN  - 743045357; 201026407
AB  - I appreciate the opportunity offered by the editor to reflect on the relationship between cognitive and social psychology. This topic has interested me my entire professional life, because I was admitted to graduate school to study social psychology and then eventually migrated to cognitive psychology. The organization of this paper is as follows: I first relate my (somewhat puzzling) personal experiences that led me to wonder about relations between cognitive and social psychology. I suggest that, for many topics, the placement of a topic of study in one field or the other is arbitrary. Next I selectively review some common historical influences on the development of both fields, ones that have made them similar. Both grew from common seeds, which include Gestalt psychology as it became applied to a wider array of topics, experimental psychologists becoming interested in attitude change during and after World War II, and Bartlett's famous book on Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Next I review some research from my lab that picked up themes from Bartlett's work and that, in some aspects, combines cognitive and social approaches. I also discuss the issue of memory conformity or the social contagion of memory, and conclude with thoughts about how social and cognitive psychologists might collaborate on an exciting new arena, creating empirical studies of collective memory.
