T1  - The Role of the Family for Racism and Xenophobia in Childhood and Adolescence
AN  - 2703906112
AB  - Racism and xenophobia are not just the problems of the adult world. As systems of beliefs, practices, and policies, racism and xenophobia influence children’s perceptions and experiences at early ages. Because families can be significant sources of information regarding race and ethnicity, we focus on the family to understand the broader context of racism and xenophobia in childhood and adolescence. In this paper, we first provide an overview of research conducted among BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) and ethnic/religious minority families that has focused on family ethnic–racial socialization to support children and adolescents’ capabilities for resisting racism and xenophobia. We then review research conducted among white and ethnic/religious majority families that has mainly taken an intergroup relations perspective and has examined associations between parents’ and children’s ethnic–racial attitudes, biases, and prejudice. Finally, we discuss the role of family for racism and xenophobia through the lens of family ethnic–racial socialization and intergroup relations perspectives, highlight areas that are currently understudied, and offer recommendations concerning future research directions.

T1  - Development of synchrony‐dominant expectations in observers
AN  - 2653190116
AB  - Movement synchrony is an essential feature of rituals and collective displays around the world. Previous studies have shown that synchronous movements increase observers’ perceived group entitativity and fighting capacity in agonistic contexts; however, little is known about the developmental roots of synchrony‐dominant attributions. In this study, adult participants (Exp 1), 5‐ to 6‐year‐old children (Exp 2) and 7‐ to 8‐year‐old children (Exp 3) predicted outcomes of zero‐sum conflicts between two groups of animated agents after each group exhibited either synchronised or non‐synchronised movements. Predictions were made for conflicts between two individual members from different groups (individual‐conflict condition) and between all members of the two groups (group‐conflict condition). Results showed that none of the participant groups showed a synchrony‐dominant preference in the individual‐conflict condition. In the group‐conflict condition, most adult participants expected the groups exhibiting synchronised movements to be socially dominant. Although 5‐ to 6‐year‐old children did not show more biased expectations than can be accounted for by chance, adult‐like synchrony‐dominant preference was found in 7‐ to 8‐year‐old children. Moreover, justifications of the synchrony‐dominant expectation in both adults and 7‐ to 8‐year‐old children showed that this expectation was driven by the perceived entitativity of the synchronous group. These findings show that the expectation of group dominance based on synchronous movements is strongly developed in school‐age children, explaining the developmental origins of intergroup attitudes as well as the cognitive mechanisms children employ when making judgments in intergroup contexts.

T1  - ‘We are not separatist because so many of us are mixed’: resisting negative stereotypes of neighbourhood ethnic residential concentration
AN  - 2651909788
AB  - This paper aims to disrupt the dominant ‘segregation as negative’ narrative, by exploring hopeful experiences and perceptions of ethnic residential concentration. Drawing on fieldwork in an ethnically mixed, working-class inner-city neighbourhood, we critically reflect on recent debates around ethnic segregation, particularly hegemonic and ‘official’ policy discourses that position ethnic concentration as incompatible with social solidarity. Narratives from residents’ in-depth interviews in Liverpool 8 problematise this association, offering alternative interpretations of ethnic concentration. Historically, Black and other racially minoritised communities were spatially confined to this area through endemic structural racism. This accentuated existing class, religious and racial inequalities, leading to the stigmatisation and marginalisation of neighbourhood and community. Neighbourhood challenges to racism help both shape and reinforce allegiance and belonging to the neighbourhood of Liverpool 8. Out of structural discrimination and spatial confinement, a unique identity with place has been forged. This has strengthened perceptions of social solidarity amongst residents and led to a neighbourhood belonging ‘through difference’, not despite the multiple disadvantages residents faced, but, in many ways, because of them. Our findings underscore the value of contextualising the circumstances under which ethnic concentration is (re)created – to appreciate the nuances of its consequences, and how communities respond to them.

T1  - The Structure of Presidential Evaluations: White Men, White Women, and Trump
AN  - 2641224409
AB  - This study uses an intersectional lens to study the structure of presidential evaluations among white men and white women. I argue that due to their distinct positions of power in American politics via the intersection of race and gender, different processes, wrapped into white heteropatriarchy, explain white men and women’s 2018 favorable mid-term evaluations of President Donald Trump. Using a sample from the 2018 CCES, I find that although there is some overlap in the factors that explain positive evaluations of Trump anti-Blackness, gender identity, and Republican partisanship structured white men’s favorable evaluations of Trump, while sexism, anti-immigration sentiment, and ideology structured white women’s favorable evaluations. The variable with the strongest association with evaluations of Trump for men was negative assessments of the economy, and the variable with the strongest association with evaluations of Trump for women was anti-immigration sentiment.

T1  - Does Origin Matter? Ethnic Group Position and Attitudes Toward Immigrants: The Case of Russia
AN  - 2637624636
AB  - This article analyzes the relationship between the relative position of an ethnic group, as measured by its majority/minority status at a subnational level, and attitudes of its members toward immigrants of different origins. Based on the Russian case, it addresses the question whether the effects of in-group majority status within a region on attitudes toward the general category of immigrants hold regardless of out-group origin and, if not, what may drive this variation. Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics and Bayesian hierarchical structural equation modeling, the study demonstrates that the relative position of an ethnic in-group is of varying importance as a predictor of attitudes toward migrant groups of European versus non-European origin in Russia. A group’s majority status within a region proved to play a role in predicting attitudes toward migrants originating from the “south” (encompassing North and South Caucasus; Central Asia; and China, Vietnam, and Korea) but not toward migrants coming from the “west” (Ukraine and Moldova). We draw on arguments related to the source and the level of threat induced by the out-groups, ethnic hierarchies, and group cues to explain this pattern of results.

T1  - The Reconciliation Of Opposites: Challenging Group Categorization And Stereotypes In Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's "A Private Experience" And César Mba A. Abogo's "Hora De Partir"
AN  - 2638773379
AB  - Social Identity Theory (Tajfel; Tajfel and Turner) is rooted in the premise that individuals construct their own identities based on social categorization and group membership, and this attachment of people to groups is sufficient "to produce prejudices both in favor of members of one's own group and sometimes against members of another group" (Dovidio et al. 4). In this article, I analyze how the characters in "A Private Experience" (2009), by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and "Hora de Partir" (2007), by César Mba A. Abogo, resist group categorization and minimize stereotyping and group distinctions by experiencing intergroup relationships and enhancing their individualities. While the story "A Private Experience" portrays a Muslim and a Christian woman who defy the Muslim-Christian conflict in Nigeria by means of their peaceful and close connection, the interracial couple in "Hora de Partir" challenges racial and social prejudices through their love relationship. Thus, both narratives depict resistant subjects who confront the hegemonic ideologies resulting from group categorizations by the mutual interest between individuals who belong to conflicting groups and the depiction of a fruitful amalgam of transcultural elements within the stories that endorses diversity as a positive social value. By means of establishing harmonious relationships with outgroup members, these literary voices delegitimize intergroup conflict, trigger a transcultural dialogue, and find an effective way to resist the social constraints imposed by group categorization.

T1  - (De)humanization and (dis)trust: Representations of Muslims in the UK newspapers following the 7/7 London bombings
AN  - 2547612300
AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust.

T1  - Prejudice and pandemic in the promised land: how white Christian nationalism shapes Americans’ racist and xenophobic views of COVID-19
AN  - 2492800004
AB  - During the COVID-19 crisis in March/April of 2020, far-right American political leaders and pundits proffered xenophobic explanations for the pandemic while ignoring that poorer, Black Americans and prison populations were being disproportionately infected. We propose such xenophobic and racist evaluations of COVID-19 drew from and appealed to a pervasive and politically strategic ethnoreligious ideology—white Christian nationalism. Panel data fielded before and during the COVID-19 crisis show that Christian nationalism was invariably the strongest predictor that Americans felt it was not racist to call COVID-19 “the Chinese virus”, blamed minorities for their own disproportionate infection rate, favoured immigration restrictions to solve the pandemic, and minimized or justified the infections of prison inmates. Racial identity also moderated Christian nationalism’s effect such that it was typically a more powerful influence among whites compared to Blacks. Findings affirm that racist and xenophobic views promulgated during the COVID-19 crisis were undergirded by white Christian nationalism.

T1  - National Identity as a Means of Reducing Ethnic Negativism
AN  - 2526499401
AB  - This article discusses how national identity in Russia is understood by the public and among experts who study ethnic issues. The author separates the notion of national identity into categorical identity and associative identity (i.e., the consolidating type of identity which is based on a strong feeling of connection with other citizens). The latter type of identity is present only among a third of people who identify themselves as Russian. The author further analyzes the connection of this type of identity with inter-ethnic negativism. She finds that national identity does not remove bias toward abstract “others.” However, it affects direct inter-ethnic communication in the labor and family spheres. The positive impact of national identity on inter-ethnic attitudes is more apparent in the Astrakhan region, which has longer experience of inter-ethnic communication. It is argued that one obstacle to national identity having a positive impact on inter-ethnic attitudes is the lack of a clear and consistent understanding of national identity among education experts, social scientists, and journalists. The study utilizes data from Wave 24 of the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey conducted by the Institute of Sociology (“The dynamics of social transformation of modern Russia in the socioeconomic, political, sociocultural, and ethno-confessional contexts,” Wave 4) and several separate regional polls conducted by the Department of Ethno-sociology of the Institute of Sociology, Russian Academy of Sciences between 2014 and 2016.

T1  - Standing up for whom? Targets’ different goals in the confrontation of discrimination
AN  - 2492949610
AB  - We challenge the common interpretation of targets’ immediate confrontation in reaction to discrimination as self‐serving behavior and propose different underlying motivations for this phenomenon. In five online scenario studies (Noverall = 1,447), we demonstrate across different samples and contexts that targets indicate a distinct pursuit of the following self‐reported confrontation goals: individual‐benefit (e.g., perpetrator apologizes); group‐benefit (e.g., prejudice reduction); and distancing (e.g., demonstrating that one is different from typical group members). Furthermore, meaningful associations of the pursuits of individual‐benefitting goals and group‐benefitting goals with group identification, disidentification, and further collective action intentions indicate that they represent different confrontation motivations: Individual‐benefitting confrontation serves to cope with the individual mistreatment of discrimination, whereas group‐benefitting confrontation represents a form of collective action. Distancing goals were associated with disidentification and—unexpectedly—group identification. Our results show that the phenomenon of confrontation in reaction to discrimination can be the result of different underlying psychological processes.

T1  - Close to me: The importance of closeness versus superficiality in explaining the positive‐negative contact asymmetry
AN  - 2408791442
AB  - The evidence for differential effects of positive and negative intergroup contact on prejudice is mixed. We propose that the closeness of the relationships respondents have with contact partners can explain inconsistencies in previous findings. In three studies (total N = 953), we tested the associations between positive intimate, negative intimate, positive superficial, and negative superficial contact and attitudes toward different outgroups (immigrants and gay people). We hypothesized that: (H1) the effect of positive contact would be maximized in intimate interactions; (H2) the effect of negative contact would be maximized in superficial interactions; (H3) positive intimate and negative superficial contact would have similar power in predicting attitudes. Results always supported H1, and supported H2 and H3 only with immigrants. Findings held also when controlling for category salience and agreeableness, but not for social dominance orientation, which instead strengthened the effect of negative superficial contact. Overall, findings clarify the positive–negative contact asymmetry.

T1  - Spontaneous imagined contact and intergroup relations: Quality matters
AN  - 2341199376
AB  - While research on experimental interventions that aim to improve outgroup attitudes via contact imagery grows, it is important to examine if contact imagery that occurs in spontaneous, non‐experimentally controlled conditions drives attitudes, and in what direction. To answer this, we constructed and validated a spontaneous imagined intergroup contact scale (SIICS) that differentiates between frequency, quality and elaboration of the spontaneous imagery of outgroups. In three correlational studies (NPortugal = 305, NUnited Kingdom = 185, NItaly = 276), we tested the role of spontaneous imagined contact frequency, quality and elaboration in predicting attitudes and social distance (Studies 1–3) and intended behaviour (Study 3) toward immigrant groups. Results demonstrated that spontaneous imagined contact quality consistently predicted key outcome variables above and beyond the other two dimensions. Importantly, the effects were significant while controlling for other potent forms of direct and indirect contact. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed.

T1  - Mentoring future researchers: Advice and considerations
AN  - 2249726977
AB  - Despite efforts to increase the diversity of academia, minority scholars continue to face significant barriers (e.g., higher financial burden, lack of institutional support for research interests, social isolation) that undermine their representation in the field and overall professional success. Researchers have suggested increased mentorship as a means of mitigating these challenges. In 2015, with the support of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a panel of senior investigators met via WebEx to discuss strategies to improve the mentorship of underrepresented scholars. The topics covered by this panel included factors that optimize or challenge mentorship based on personal experience, what is special about mentorship in the context of race/ethnicity, relational dynamics, work–life balance, discrimination, and how to address challenges to the mentoring relationship. The current article provides an overview of the convening and synthesizes the lessons learned by panelists' first-hand experiences of mentoring trainees and junior faculty of color. Authors conclude with recommendations and a description of the social and institutional implications of bolstering the professional support of minority scholars.

T1  - Discourses on 'authenticity': language ideology, ethnic boundaries, and Tibetan identity on a multi-ethnic campus
AN  - 2124861383
AB  - This paper examines Tibetan ethnicity by studying the language ideologies among Tibetan students and their persistent roles in shaping ethnic boundaries at a Minzu University (MU). MU attracts the highest achieving ethnic minority students throughout China and explicitly aims to turn them into patriotic minority cadres. Hosting extremely heterogeneous Tibetans from different dialect groups, MU is an ideal field for studying inter-ethnic relations and in-group interactions among Tibetans. Ethnographic data reveals that Tibetan language has been a significant ethnic boundary marker and a crucial toolkit for ethnic empowerment. On one hand, it has been used as an exclusive way of distinguishing between 'pure' and 'non-pure', 'authentic' and 'fake' Tibetans, the latter of which are discriminated against on campus by both Tibetan and Han students. On the other hand, Tibetan language has been conveniently appropriated by the so-called authentic Tibetans to organise many ethnic cultural practices, resist the marginalisation of the Tibetan group, and achieve a higher ethnic status. Yet, Tibetans' discourses on 'authenticity' are rooted in the same principles of alterity and hierarchy under which minorities are subject to by the majority, that they unavoidably marginalise and stigmatise certain 'non-standard' yet culturally Tibetan populations.

T1  - An exploratory study on the attitudes of elderly Finns towards Russian-speaking minorities
AN  - 2101290553
AB  - Research has shown Russian speakers in Finland are often victims of prejudice and discrimination. Utilizing integrated threat theory, this study investigated the extent to which threats are significant predictors of prejudice towards Russian speakers in Finland among a highly neglected research population - the elderly. This study also aimed at finding out which threat (realistic threat, symbolic threat, and negative stereotyping) was the most significant predictor of attitudes towards members of the Russian-speaking minority, and the extent to which men and women differed. In a sample of 90 participants, aged 65 and above, results indicated realistic threat and symbolic threat were not significant predictors of prejudicial attitudes towards members of the Russian-speaking community. Negative stereotyping however had a negative effect on prejudice. Moreover, contrary to previous research on prejudice, there were no significant differences between men and women on threat.

T1  - Islamophobia, war and non-Muslims as victims: an analysis of online discourse on an English Defence League message board
AN  - 2043766637
AB  - This article analyses 845 posts across 78 threads on an English Defence League message board from 20 September 2013 to 4 October 2013 that examined how online activists construct and develop their racial prejudice. Through seeing whites as blameless victims, the posts highlighted the presence of hostility towards Islam and Muslims in a clear in-group and out-group racial binary, where racist comments were never contested or challenged. Rather, they were wholeheartedly supported with social and cultural division at the centre of the prejudice, scapegoating and stereotyping directed towards Islam and Muslims. For a movement that presents itself as anti-racist, the real-life everyday narrative indicates the reality of its most ardent supporters.

T1  - The internal and external constraints on foreign policy in India: exploring culture and ethnic sensitivities
AN  - 1915903709
AB  - The main argument of this contribution is that the distinction between internal and external is at best blurred and in reality does not make much sense in the case of India's foreign policy. It may start and end at the border and be determined by negotiations, diplomacy or brute force but there is no conclusive evidence in the literature to decide what determines what. There are important dynamics and interplays across the thin line between the domestic and international spheres, especially in terms of understanding the reciprocal challenges related to how factors of culture and ethnicity relate with the legitimacy of the state. The aim of the paper is to serve four purposes. To unpack and give a critical overview of the debates concerned with the internal and external aspects of India's foreign policy; to situate the literature dealing more specifically with domestic issues related to culture and ethnicity and outline the main approaches involved; to give an overview of how external factors impact foreign policy conduct and relate to India's role in defining international norms and regulations; and, finally, to give some theoretical markers, suggestions and concluding remarks.

T1  - Are the ethnically tolerant free of discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance?
AN  - 1929389479
AB  - We hypothesized that the ethnically tolerant (i.e., people who are anti-ethnocentric and score very low on a measure of ethnocentrism) would perceive people with extremely incompatible values and beliefs as out-groups and would engage in discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Experiments among Australian citizens in Studies 1 (N = 224) and 2 (N = 283) showed that the ethnically tolerant perceived supporters of a message in favour of mandatory detention of asylum seekers as out-groups and consequently exhibited discrimination, prejudice and political intolerance against them. Study 3 with 265 U.S. citizens showed that, controlling for liberalism, ethnic tolerance led to prejudice against out-groups. This was replicated with 522 UK citizens in Study 4, which also showed that social identity, and not moral conviction, mediated the link between ethnic tolerance and prejudice. The findings suggest that the ethnically tolerant can be discriminatory, prejudiced and politically intolerant against fellow humans.

T1  - On Old-Fashioned Versus Modern Homonegativity Distinction: Evidence From Poland
AN  - 1854785964
AB  - Psychological research on prejudice against homosexuals distinguishes between old-fashioned (traditional) and modern (contemporary) homonegativity, which differ with regard to their content, correlates, and consequences. The current research offers evidence for the validity of old-fashioned versus modern homonegativity distinction in the post-communist, East European context. In Studies 1 and 2 (Ns = 295 and 327, respectively) the Polish adaptations of the non-gendered and gendered Homonegativity Scale (Morrison, Parriag, & Morrison, 1999) and the Modern Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2003) were developed. Furthermore, divergent (discriminant) validity of traditional and contemporary anti-homosexual prejudice was demonstrated. Old-fashioned and modern homonegativity exhibited differential relationships with social distance and support for same-sex couples' relational rights.

T1  - Far Right Populism and Women: The Normalisation of Gendered Anti-Muslim Racism and Gendered Culturalism in the Netherlands
AN  - 1833978394
AB  - The paper approaches the rise of far right populism in Europe with a feminist lens and on the background of the discursively constructed sexist and racist features of the current moral panic. It is argued that we can follow up a continuum of normalised culturalist gendered discourses in Europe, and for some time, in the Netherlands in particular. The paper is organised by looking, first, at the place of gender in far right discourses and the role of women in far right-wing populist parties. Second, a feminist critique of processes of normalisation is presented, helping to clarify the term 'culturalism'. To illustrate the dynamics of gendered culturalism and the way it impacts the everyday life of Muslim women in the Netherlands, some interview sequences of an empirical study with female Dutch-Moroccan citizens are discussed. The experiences of the women illustrate how far right populist perspectives and prejudices entered their daily lives, and which counter strategies, the women used to resist intimidation.

T1  - Does Closeness to Someone Who Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Influence Etiology Beliefs About Homosexuality?
AN  - 1831273196
AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n = 851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

T1  - Interethnic dating preferences of Roma and non-Roma secondary school students
AN  - 1820665838
AB  - Integrated schooling is known to induce interethnic friendship relations; however, it also creates the opportunity of interethnic dating. Interethnic personal relationships or long-term exposure decreases ethnic prejudice, thus it is proposed that willingness to date between ethnic groups may also increase. The question arises, whether in the school context exposure is enough for this mechanism to emerge, or personal contact is necessary. It must also be taken into account that romantic relationships are embedded in status relations within schools. Based on a 'social exchange' mechanism, it is assumed that the less popular members of the majority groups are those who are more willing to form interethnic dating relations. To address the above questions empirically, the data of 1213 Hungarian 9th grade students in 43 classes were analysed. Preferences of Roma and non-Roma students were measured by dyadic attribution of physical attractiveness and nominations of willingness to date. Results of multilevel p2 models suggest that mixed groups are not sufficient, but personal contacts are necessary to decrease same-ethnicity preferences in dating. An additional tendency is salient: among majority students, those who are isolated from the friendship networks are the ones who are more willing to date members of the minority group.

T1  - Body Control
AN  - 1793655851
AB  - This article genealogically explores the present dilemma of the queer migratory body with intersecting identities that carry a historical timeline of prejudice concerning body control based on foreign-born status, color, class, and sexual citizenship within a nation with a colonial history, the United States specifically. The social space effects of possessing multiple minority identities are expounded upon by charting past events, statutes, and prejudicial practices while correlating them to the social restrictions of free movement placed upon queer migratory bodies of color today. This article takes into consideration various forms of economic, social, and cultural capital-based inclusive entry fees into ethnically reflective urban space, queer urban space, and public urban space. This article also explores the social reactions of majority populations in situations that threaten the capitalist neocolonial power construct model and how this reaction impacts queer migratory bodies of color within urban spaces.

T1  - The 2012 killing of Chinese citizens in Rome and the ambivalence of Italian journalism
AN  - 1784145627
AB  - Sredanovic discusses the killing of a father and daughter of Chinese origin in Rome in January 2012, and the portrayal of the case in Italian print journalism. He uses a qualitative analysis of a corpus of 193 articles from seven Italian newspapers with different political, market and geographic profiles. The frequency of generally negative and stereotypical portraits of migrants in crime news is well known; however, this specific case offers a number of less familiar insights. Sredanovic shows the multiple and changing frames and themes, both positive and negative, deployed to portray the event across the two-week period in which it was featured on the front pages of newspapers. He demonstrates in particular the ways in which stereotypes that are often used against migrants in crime news find place even in a case in which the migrants were the victims of the crime. He further illustrate how the representation of the perpetrators shifted from describing them as an exception (when it was thought they were autochthonous) to generalizing about their deviance when it was discovered that they were of Moroccan origin. Sredanovic locates this discussion in an anti-groupist theoretical frame, arguing that the stereotypes used cannot be adequately explained by majority-minority group interactions, and that the delimitation and definition of groups should be understood as ideological from the start. He also argues that aspects of the production routines of crime journalism can be added to the factors that explain the portrayal of the event. He concludes by arguing that Sinophobia is a form of prejudice that varies geographically and in time, and calling for non-reifying, practice-informed analyses that mix discriminating and non-discriminating discourses.

T1  - Alignment with globalized Western culture: Between inclusionary values and an exclusionary social identity
AN  - 1782205680
AB  - Reactions to globalized Western culture (GWC) are influential in shaping intergroup relations and social issues worldwide. GWC is conceptualized here as an inclusionary cultural value system but a simultaneously exclusionary social identity. Whereas GWC's inclusive values may promote the civil liberties and fair treatment of gay people, for instance, as a social identity, groups may use their alignment with GWC to buttress ingroup superiority over less aligned outgroups. Three studies (one correlational and two experimental in design) probe these opposing vectors in samples of Jewish-Israelis, who are generally highly aligned with GWC. Results demonstrate that GWC alignment is associated with decreased anti-gay prejudice (Studies 2 and 3) but exclusionary responses towards Arab individuals and groups (Studies 1, 2, and 3), who are perceived to be less aligned with GWC. Conducted during the 2014 Israeli-Palestinian war, Study 3 notably demonstrated that a GWC identification prime reduced Jewish-Israelis' willingness to offer humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians in need. This may suggest that in some contexts, GWC's divisive function as a social identity supersedes its more inclusionary humanistic values. These contrary effects of GWC alignment by social target are discussed, alongside their implications on national, regional, and international levels.

T1  - U.S. ethnic minorities' attitudes towards Whites: The role of shared reality theory in intergroup relations
AN  - 1782205125
AB  - In the current research, we suggest that shared reality, the belief that one perceives the world the same way as another group, can predict attitudes towards that group. We tested shared reality theory in the context of American ethnic minority groups' (i.e., African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinas/os) attitudes towards White Americans. In surveys of two samples recruited from different geographical locations in the USA, we tested predictions derived from different theories of intergroup relations. Using mediational analysis, we defined models to assess the extent to which shared reality theory predicted--directly and indirectly--prejudicial attitudes towards Whites. We tested the model derived from shared reality theory against other theoretical alternatives. Taken together, the results of the research indicated that shared reality predicts attitudes towards White Americans among these three ethnic groups. Thus, shared reality is a relevant, though largely overlooked, factor in intergroup dynamics.

T1  - Afterword: How I Use #BlackLivesMatter as an Entry Point and a Disruption Tool: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1881718046
AB  - Raised as a member of the southern grandparent generation, the author was never unaware of white supremacy and racial prejudice. She knew of archetypal white supremacy like the Ku Klux Klan, but rarely imagined white supremacy as a burly man in a white sheet and pointy cap. Her run-ins with whiteness were more subtle: a white person's random glare on the street or being stopped by a smiling white woman to touch her hair and asking her grandmother how she was so clean and neat. However, the majority of her learning about how to maneuver around white people was experienced in the classroom. One particularly striking memory was in eighth grade. As a college professor at a predominantly white institution, she relies heavily on the teaching moments of her youth to curate her pedagogical approaches. Her classroom is constructed as a reclamation space for her students to engage with black literature and culture. Students are challenged to acknowledge marginalized experiences that are often outside of their own comfort zone.

T1  - Encountering the southern Other: imagining the Civil Rights Movement through travel narrative
AN  - 1784145696
AB  - Kuryla proposes rethinking the Civil Rights Movement through a consideration of travel narratives. This requires recasting the movement as it is 'imagined', recognizing its contemporary function as an ultimate good in modern moral discourse, in which it works to legitimize most any political position. With this in mind, travel narratives reveal this imagined movement at work as travellers, either explicitly or implicitly, considered their place within or outside the movement, particularly in their encounters with white and black Southerners in southern spaces during and after its classic phase (roughly 1955-65). As a thought experiment, Kuryla offers two readings of V. S. Naipaul's A Turn in the South (1989), moving from considerations of post-civil rights era black leadership to an account of the role that southern hospitality and violence played in Mississippi in the middle of the 1960s, respectively. Viewing the movement through the lens of a travel writer like Naipaul draws attention to a constantly changing southern society amidst a life and death struggle over intimate questions having to do with naming practices and hospitality. Naipaul's status as a postcolonial outsider sets these questions against a backdrop of global assumptions about postcolonial development and historical consciousness.

T1  - South Carolina and the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement
AN  - 1784145522
AB  - South Carolina has to date played a minor role in the historiography of the Civil Rights Movement. Greene's article revisits the history of civil rights with reference to the Palmetto State and, in the process, a fuller understanding of the complexities of the Civil Rights Movement begins to emerge. From the challenge of the Progressive Democratic Party over credentials in 1944 (preceding the better-known story of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party by twenty years) to the state's integral role in the rise of New Right conservatism in the late 1960s, Greene presents an alternative vision of the rise and fall of the New Deal coalition in the middle of the twentieth century. He highlights figures crucial to the struggle for African American self-determination. Women such as Modjeska Simkins and men like John H. McCray stand centre stage and demonstrate the various strategies employed by black South Carolinians in the struggle for civil and human rights. Overall, Greene focuses attention on a state that is often neglected in the standard narratives of the Civil Rights Movement.

T1  - 'I second that emotion': a case for using imaginative sources in writing civil rights history
AN  - 1784144972
AB  - Imaginative sources are a rich archival store. Facts may be as slippery as the sources in which they are contained, but to limit the sources we use in building a civil rights historiography is to risk curtailing the reach and interdisciplinary scope of historical scholarship. We need to read imaginative and subjective sources as objects for the study, analysis and explanation of the Civil Rights Movement. In civil rights, as in other historical subjects, there is a privileging of an 'objective', detached approach to historiography in which 'the knower' is made distinct from what is known, and fact distinct from its imaginative representation. Monteith's essay argues that much can be gained by examining those sources in which the feeling of the movement is explored sensitively and intellectually-or even exploited. Organizers in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Freedom Summer volunteers chose to represent the movement in fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction, and found themselves represented in fiction films. Monteith argues that imagination and emotion should be more closely incorporated into civil rights history writing but attention needs to be paid to genre and style if generically unstable sources are not to be misread as unadorned fact.

T1  - Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism in Iran: The Effects of Identity, Threat, and Political Trust
AN  - 1734967225
AB  - Antisemitism and anti-Zionism constitute two important ideological building blocks of the Islamic Republic of Iran. This article is the first to present quantitative empirical survey data elucidating attitudes towards Jews and Israel among an opportunity sample of Iranians. This study examines the correlates of antisemitism and anti-Zionism in Iran with particular attention to the effects of identity, threat, and political trust. Consistent with emerging research into antisemitism and anti-Zionism, there was a positive association between both forms of prejudice, suggesting social psychological overlap between the constructs. Given the pervasiveness of antisemitic and anti-Zionist representations in Iran, there were no significant differences in levels of anti-Zionism or antisemitism on the basis of gender and educational orientations. Political conservatives did manifest greater antisemitism and anti-Zionism than political reformists, although both groups scored high on these scales. There was a significant interaction effect of Iranian national identity and political trust on anti-Zionism, and a significant interaction effect of Muslim religious identity and political trust on antisemitism. Political trust was by far the most powerful predictor of both forms of prejudice, followed by the perception of identity threat. These observations are considered through the lenses of Social Identity Theory and Identity Process Theory from social psychology.

T1  - Anti-Racist Racism as a Judicial Decree: Racism in the Twenty-First Century
AN  - 1929900511
AB  - Racism is the by-product of European imperialism. By definition, anti-racism is a prejudicial function linked with fear, stress, or various forms of power-loss anxiety. Data tends to show that not only are black adult males over-represented in the criminal justice system as the focus of said power-loss anxiety but their adolescent counterparts are as well. The fact that society tolerates the black male as a societal failure is a matter of anti-racist racism sanctioned by judicial decree. Furthermore, in its decree, the Supreme Court facilitated anti-racist racism via opposition to affirmative action enabling the most marginal among white applicants in lieu of non-white applicants whose racial contributions stood to move society as a whole forward. The most conscientious among the citizenry must then necessarily take it upon themselves to reverse judicial decree, i.e., anti-racist racism to meet the racial challenges of the twenty-first century and beyond.

T1  - Visible Muslimness in Scotland: between discrimination and integration
AN  - 1784145620
AB  - Bonino's article casts light on the realities and perceptions of ethno-religious discrimination among Muslims in Scotland, with particular reference to those living in Edinburgh, during both everyday social interaction with the indigenous Scottish community, and contact with police and security officers. Discrimination against ethnic minorities in Scotland can be traced back in history; however, it is its post-9/11 multifaceted form that has particularly targeted Muslims qua Muslims in a global climate of distrust and stigmatization. While publicly available statistics show a decrease in racist incidents in Scotland, findings from other studies illustrate a more complex situation in which prejudice and discrimination intermingle in ways that make it hard to quantify the precise extent of anti-Muslim sentiment. Qualitative data collected specifically in Edinburgh suggest that Muslims' hyper-visibility has triggered ethno-religious discrimination by some members of the non-Muslim majority. However, the daily experiences of life in Scotland, and the social relations with non-Muslims, are more heterogeneous and nuanced; they include overall positive views of, and a certain engagement with, many non-Muslims in a context of relative harmony. Contact with police and security officers at airports constitutes the main area of concern for Scottish Muslims, whose confidence, sense of equality and feelings of belonging to society are severely undermined by the securitization of their ethno-religious difference. The path towards a pluralistic Scottishness rests on sociopolitical and institutional efforts to reduce the discrimination against visible diversity, especially at loci of security, and to include the symbolic and physical distinctiveness of Muslimness within the porous Scottish cultural boundaries.

T1  - Mapping the meaning of 'difference' in Europe: A social topography of prejudice
AN  - 1933539589
AB  - This paper draws on original empirical research to investigate popular understandings of prejudice in two national contexts: Poland and the United Kingdom. The paper demonstrates how common-sense meanings of prejudice are inflected by the specific histories and geographies of each place: framed in terms of 'distance' (Poland) and 'proximity' (United Kingdom), respectively. Yet, by treating these national contexts as nodes and linking them analytically the paper also exposes a connectedness in these definitions which brings into relief the common processes that produce prejudice. The paper then explores how inter-linkages between the United Kingdom and Poland within the wider context of the European Union are producing - and circulating through the emerging international currency of 'political correctness' - a common critique of equality legislation and a belief that popular concerns about the way national contexts are perceived to be changing as a consequence of super mobility and super diversity are being silenced. This raises a real risk that in the context of European austerity and associated levels of socioeconomic insecurity, negative attitudes and conservative values may begin to be represented as popular normative standards which transcend national contexts to justify harsher political responses towards minorities. As such, the paper concludes by making a case for prejudice reduction strategies to receive much greater priority in both national and European contexts.

T1  - Consequences of Diversity for Social Cohesion and Prejudice: The Missing Dimension of Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1735658597; 201536873
AB  - A controversial claim that diversity has negative consequences for trust and other outcomes spawned a contentious debate in sociology and political science, but was hardly noted in social psychology. I summarize the debate, and argue that the efficacy of direct, face-to-face intergroup contact as a means of reducing prejudice is a stark omission, as I illustrate with evidence of the association between diversity, on the one hand, and trust, prejudice, and social capital on the other. I also consider two other contributions of contact theory to this issue, namely that contact with members of one group has an impact on attitudes toward members of other groups; and that contact should be studied via social networks. Despite the importance I attach to contact, I note two 'enemies of contact,' resegregation in ostensibly desegregated settings, and negatively valenced contact. Finally, I point to the kind of research we should do, in order to increase the impact of our work on the public policy debate on this issue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The religious affiliation and anti-Semitism of secondary school-age Swedish youths: an analysis of survey data from 2003 and 2009
AN  - 1722763432
AB  - Not only Swedish studies, but also several international studies, claim an increase in anti-Semitic attitudes in recent decades. As prejudice is acquired in the early years of socialization, and/or is innate and fairly stable over the life cycle, examining adolescents' attitudes is vitally important. Hence, by controlling for individual demographic and socio-economic background factors, we study two interrelated questions: Has anti-Semitism among Swedish secondary school-age youths changed between 2003 and 2009? Are changes equal across groups, with a specific focus on religious groups? Using two unique cross-section surveys of secondary school-age students in Sweden for the years 2003 and 2009, we try to address the above questions. Our analysis shows, in contrast to the views of the general public and other related studies, that anti-Semitism has decreased slightly during the examined period. Moreover, the study finds a variation in anti-Semitism by religious affiliation: it has increased among Muslim youth, but remains stable in other groups.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Factors Affecting School Attachment Among Lesbian, Bisexual, and Heterosexual Girls
AN  - 1700673129; 201525285
AB  - School attachment is often regarded as a key measure in gauging the integration and wellbeing of students. Previous research suggests that levels of school attachment are generally lower among sexual minority students, but most studies focus on between-gender comparisons and do not conduct within-gender analyses. Using data from the First National Climate Survey on Homophobia and Transphobia in Canadian schools, this study set out to empirically analyze what, if any, differences exist among lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual female students when assessing the relationship between homophobic and gender-negative language, feelings of safety, harassment/direct victimization, and school climate on school attachment. Bivariate and multivariate findings suggest that there are key differences among female students in terms of school attachment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cohort Effect on the Coming Out Experiences of Bisexual Men
AN  - 1692288762; 201521403
AB  - This article examines bisexual men's experiences of coming out across three age cohorts, and documents generational differences in the reception from friends and family regarding this disclosure. Drawing on in-depth interviews with an ethnically diverse sample of 60 openly bisexual men from the United States, we find that the oldest cohort encountered the most stereotypical views and prejudiced behaviour, while those of the youngest cohort expressed predominantly positive coming out stories. We attribute the cohort differences in these experiences to a decrease in cultural homophobia, alongside changes in the social organisation of masculinities.

T1  - Islamophobia and postcolonialism: continuity, Orientalism and Muslim consciousness
AN  - 1680153210; 201514010
AB  - In this article, Meer tentatively delineates three ways in which he understands that the concept of Islamophobia is being informed by postcolonial scholarship. The first functions as continuity, in so far as it is claimed that historical colonial dynamics are reproduced in contemporary postcolonial environments, broadly conceived. The second involves translation. This is related to the first but different in that it focuses in particular on the utility of Orientalist critique for the concept of Islamophobia. The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that 'the making of Muslims' is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider 'decentring' of the West. Meer argues that this third framing rests on terrain that is also populated by scholarship beyond the postcolonial tradition. This is because it expresses a story of how Muslims have contested and sought revisions to existing citizenship settlements, not least the ways in which approaches to anti-discrimination are configured. This is a story that is observable within imperfect liberal democratic frameworks that contain some institutional levers through which to challenge Islamophobia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexual Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage: The Influence of Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting
AN  - 1660024722; 201505825
AB  - Legal recognition of same-sex marriage is a controversial social issue. Despite a positive shift in attitudes toward gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, sexual prejudice still exists. Research suggests that religion and religiosity, contact, education, sex, gender ideologies, age, and marital and parental status contribute to biases against sexual minorities. Similar findings have been established for attitudes toward same-sex marriage; however, attitudes toward same-sex marriage have been found to be more complex and resistant to change, suggesting the influence of other factors. One potential influence that has not been investigated is the influence of attitudes toward same-sex parenting on attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Contemporary research indicates that people are still hesitant about same-sex couples raising children, which may influence their attitude about same-sex marriage. Further research to investigate the influence of attitudes toward same-sex parenting on attitudes toward same-sex marriage is warranted, and findings from those studies may be useful in educational settings or promotions for social change.

T1  - Combatting antisemitism in the school playground: an Australian case study
AN  - 1660023721; 201505641
AB  - The aim of Gross and Rutland's paper is to analyse the problem of antisemitic bullying in contemporary Australian state schools by investigating the case of Jewish children in those schools. The study is interdisciplinary, drawing on historical data and educational methodology, and employs a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews conducted in Sydney and Melbourne with all the major actors: students (55), teachers (10), principals (4), parents (13) and Jewish communal leaders (10). Gross and Rutland argue that classical anti-Jewish stereotypes are perpetuated in the school playground, transmitted by children from one generation to the next. This finding provides an additional perspective to the general literature, which argues that racial prejudice and stereotypes are acquired primarily through home socialization, religious institutions and the media, and neglects the role of the school playground.

T1  - Strivers vs skivers: Class prejudice and the demonisation of dependency in everyday life
AN  - 1551000734; 201429131
AB  - This paper focuses on the moral dimension of everyday lives, using original empirical material about the judgments we make about others to explore and understand the contemporary nature of class prejudice. In doing so, we pay attention to the relationship between class prejudice and other forms of stigma and discrimination by exploring the complex (re)alignment of associations between different social groups (including working class people, disabled people, asylum seekers) in processes of 'othering' and exclusion. The research highlights the potential shared interest of groups who are demonised for being 'in need' to challenge the contemporary hegemony of the individualised ethic of self-interest which is producing a process of de-socialisation in which the importance of values such as care, compassion and social responsibility risk becoming casualties with inevitable consequences for social cohesion. Rather, the paper concludes by arguing for a re-socialisation of politics that recognises the structural causes of inequalities and which values and promotes understandings across, instead of moral judgements of, difference and our social obligations towards each other.

T1  - 'I'm not like all these Ecuadorians'. Promises and dilemmas of immigrants' selective ethnicity appropriation
AN  - 1550999769; 201429181
AB  - This article revisits my translocal ethnography of Ecuadorian immigration to Italy, building on the notions of ethnicization and selective ethnicity appropriation. The salience of an ethnic dimension, in the daily lives of the migrants I met, is explored with regard to collective identification, alignment with co-nationals and interactions with natives. By de-constructing migrants' ethnicity from within, a range of expectations and strategies towards the receiving society emerges. While processes of ethnicization affect them in cognitive, discursive and practical terms, immigrants selectively draw from their ethnicity patterns, as their previous identities and lifestyles interact with the mainstream overseas. Their ethnicity -- as a shared repertoire of habits, ways of life and common sense ideas, supported by a communal identity and background -- can be purposefully negotiated in several respects, as they strive to negotiate better life conditions overseas. Why this occurs, under what conditions, and producing what effects, are the questions to be approached in this article. As I shall argue, ethnicity-related attitudes and behaviours raise opportunities and dilemmas both for migrants' incorporation overseas and for their transnational connections.

T1  - Inter-Ethnic Neighbourhood Acquaintances of Migrants and Natives in Germany: On the Brokering Roles of Inter-Ethnic Partners and Children
AN  - 1448991654; 201342932
AB  - Social scientists have long emphasised the importance of personal inter-ethnic contact for overcoming prejudices and enhancing social cohesion in mixed societies. But why do some people have more contact with their neighbours of other ethnicity? Using new data from a large-scale German survey, I analyse the brokering roles of children and inter-ethnic partners in explaining inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances. Even on a contextual level, my results suggest that people living in regions with larger shares of children have more inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances, which expands earlier findings on the general integrating function of children. However, I also argue that we should recognise brokering to be context-specific and exemplify this by showing how the brokering role of inter-ethnic partners is evident particularly in interaction with inter-ethnic encounters at local bars and restaurants, while that of children is evident particularly given their frequent inter-ethnic encounters in public parks and playgrounds. On a theoretical level, my results demonstrate the importance of studying the interaction of mechanisms in explaining personal (inter-ethnic) contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Is Measuring Interracial Contact Enough? Racial Concentration, Racial Balance, and Perceptions of Prejudice among Black Americans
AN  - 1438560971; 201340234
AB  - Contact theory posits that interracial contact can reduce racial prejudice and perceptions of prejudice. This relationship typically has been looked at from the perspective of whites' views regarding race and racial relations, but few studies have examined the implications of interracial contact for blacks' perceptions regarding the extent of prejudice and discrimination. With data from the National Survey of Black Workers, I examine whether opportunities for contact in settings with varying racial concentrations in youth and adulthood are associated with blacks' perceptions of prejudice. I use racial concentration-measured here as mostly black settings, half-black (racially balanced) settings, and mostly white settings (compared to all-black settings)-as an indicator of opportunities for interracial contact. Multivariate analyses offer some evidence of the benefits of opportunities for contact in mixed-race and mostly white settings for blacks' perceptions of prejudice. Although having opportunities for contact can be beneficial, this evidence is limited to noncompetitive childhood environments, namely residential neighborhoods. Findings highlight the important of accounting for the racial balance of settings where interracial contact takes place. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community cohesion without parallel lives in Bradford
AN  - 1448995672; 201342930
AB  - The concept of community cohesion is the centrepiece of the policy that was formulated by the British government in response to the urban disturbances in northern English towns during 2001. A number of official reports identified lack of community cohesion as the critical factor. The central argument for community cohesion, the self-segregation thesis, was based on evidence from Bradford. The core idea, parallel lives, was first articulated in the Ouseley Report and incorporated into the Cantle Report and subsequent government reports into the 2001 disturbances. The Commission for Integration and Cohesion widened the concept of community cohesion, which encompassed faith and ethnic groups, to include income and generation, suggesting that the concept was more complex than earlier definitions allowed. However, the increasing concern with terrorism has meant that Muslims remain the focus of debates on cohesion, and a conflation of the community cohesion programme with the government's anti-terrorism strategy is evident in the policy literature. Samad's article is based on research carried out in Bradford to unearth and explore the factors that enhance or undermine community cohesion in those areas where there are established Muslim communities and, additionally, those in which Muslim migrants have recently arrived. It scrutinizes the debate on a number of issues: the difficulties in defining and implementing community cohesion policy, and the issues of segregation, social capital, transnationalism and belonging. This data-driven analysis takes the main areas of debate and tests them with evidence from Bradford. The research findings challenge some of the fundamental assumptions that have informed government policy by providing new evidence that throws light on central aspects of the debate. The need to reflect on these assumptions became more relevant after the English riots of 2011, centred in London, and the subsequent necessity to develop an effective strategy that engages with their root causes.

T1  - Conformity and counter-conformity to anti-discrimination norms: the moderating effect of attitude toward foreigners and perceived in-group threat
AN  - 1433108479
AB  - Two studies examined the influence of an anti-discrimination norm on Swiss nationals' discrimination against foreigners as a function of initial attitude (pro-foreigner vs. anti-foreigner) and in-group threat (i.e., whether or not foreigners are perceived as taking nationals' jobs). Results showed that anti-foreigners decreased their level of discrimination (i.e., a conformity effect) when threat was low, but did not change (Study 1) or increased discrimination (i.e., a counter-conformity effect) when threat was high (Study 2). No significant effects were observed for pro-foreigners. It is argued that conformity to anti-discrimination norms increases as the individual-norm discrepancy increases, insofar as the social context provides legitimacy to this norm (i.e., low in-group threat conditions).

T1  - African American Students' Responses to Racial Discrimination: How Race-Based Rejection Sensitivity and Social Constraints are Related to Psychological Reactions
AN  - 1417523734; 201331939
AB  - We examined the association between two individual differences (race-based rejection sensitivity and social constraints in talking about racism with family, friends, and/or intimate partners) and psychological reactions to an incident of racial discrimination. Participants were 551 African American undergraduates from either a predominantly white university (PWU) or a historically black university (HBU). Race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-Race) predicted higher negative affect and lower forgiveness for the perpetrator. Social constraints predicted higher negative affect and (marginally) lower forgiveness. There was also an interaction between social constraints and RS-Race: RS-Race was strongly negatively related to positive affect and forgiveness among participants with low social constraints but essentially unrelated among those with high social constraints. Thought intrusions (that might prolong the memory of the prejudicial event) also mediated the effects of RS-Race and social constraints on negative affect and forgiveness. The results document how individual differences are associated with reactions to being the target of racial discrimination in day-to-day interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'There is no discrimination here, but the Committee never elects Jews': antisemitism in British golf, 1894-1970
AN  - 1364704258; 201323365
AB  - Between the 1890s and the 1960s, Jews faced significant levels of racial discrimination within British golf. Antisemitism originating from individuals, private clubs, the golfing press and golfing authorities was prevalent across this period and was geographically widespread (affecting every sizeable Jewish community in Great Britain). Mirroring wider majority community discrimination towards the growing middle-class Jewish population, Jewish golfers faced racial hostility and exclusion: a racism driven by crude stereotypes, snobbery, ignorance and a basic irrational fear of the Other. Golfing racism was powerful and extensive in Britain, yet Jews did not simply accept the hostility they faced and cease playing the sport. While Dee's article illustrates and analyses antisemitism in British golf, it also highlights the response to discrimination by Jewish communities-large and small-across the country. Unwilling to allow antisemitism to prevent their participation in the sport, Jewish golfers strove to create their own clubs and courses. Symbolically, these 'Jewish' organizations remained open to all, regardless of race or creed. Jews not only protected their own sporting interests in the face of racism, but also provided a retort to golfing bigotry and racism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Perceptions of Whites' Motives for Responding Without Prejudice: The Perceived Internal and External Motivation to Avoid Prejudice Scales
AN  - 1364702311; 201323476
AB  - Whites' nonprejudiced behavior toward racial/ethnic minorities can be attributionally ambiguous for perceivers, who may wonder whether the behavior was motivated by a genuine internal commitment to egalitarianism or was externally motivated by desires to avoid appearing prejudiced to others. This article reports the development of a scale that measures perceptions of Whites' internal and external motives for avoiding prejudice (Perceived Internal Motivation Scale/Perceived External Motivation Scale [PIMS/PEMS]) and tests of its internal, test-retest, discriminant, convergent, and predictive validity among ethnic minority perceivers. Minorities perceived Whites as having internal and external motives for nonprejudiced behavior that were theoretically consistent with but distinct from established measures of minority-group members' concerns in interracial interactions. Tests of the predictive validity of PIMS/PEMS showed that when a White evaluator praised the mediocre essay of a minority target, minorities who were high PEMS and low PIMS were most likely to regard the feedback as inauthentic and derogate the quality of the essay.

T1  - Implicit Race/Ethnic Prejudice in Mexican Americans
AN  - 1417523327; 201333311
AB  - Implicit race/ethnic prejudice was assessed using Spanish- and English-language versions of an Implicit Association Test that used Hispanic/Anglo first names and pleasant/unpleasant words as stimuli. This test was administered to a consecutive sample of Mexican American adults residing in the Rio Grande Valley region of Texas of whom about two-thirds chose to be tested in English and one-third preferred Spanish. Participants were mostly female (73%) with a mean age of 32 years and mean education of 13 years. Among 83 participants, 43% demonstrated in-group implicit prejudice while 26% showed out-group implicit prejudice toward Anglos. There was a significant negative correlation between family values (familism and filial piety) and implicit race/ethnic prejudice scores but no significant association was found between implicit race/ethnic prejudice scores and acculturation or skin tone. Results contribute to the ongoing controversy regarding the validity of implicit race/ethnic prejudice, supporting the concept that societal not individual prejudices are being measured.

T1  - In search of racial types: soldiers and the anthropological mapping of the Romanian nation, 1914-44
AN  - 1322718956; 201310857
AB  - Turda's article explores the diverse ways in which racial research conducted on prisoners-of-war (POWs) and soldiers contributed to the emergence of anthropological narratives of national identity in Romania between 1914 and 1944. It first discusses racial typologies produced by Austrian, German, Italian and Polish anthropologists investigating POWs during the First World War, and then examines how Romanian physicians and anthropologists engaged with these typologies while refining their own scientific and nationalist agendas. An essential corollary to this development was a strong commitment to the cultivation of distinct Romanian racial types. The interwar and Second World War periods witnessed the full flowering of a Romanian race science that accommodated a racial hierarchy as the basis for national difference. Moreover, by identifying the racial types purportedly constituting the Romanian nation, anthropologists not only hoped to develop a systematic racial inventory of Romania's ethnic communities, but also to reinforce the myth of ethnogenesis, which described the Romanians as worthy of their noble European origins and legitimized their territorial claims.

T1  - The Contact Caveat: Negative Contact Predicts Increased Prejudice More Than Positive Contact Predicts Reduced Prejudice
AN  - 1494751605; 201401983
AB  - Contact researchers have largely overlooked the potential for negative intergroup contact to increase prejudice. In Study 1, we tested the interaction between contact quantity and valence on prejudice toward Black Australians (n = 1,476), Muslim Australians (n = 173), and asylum seekers (n = 293). In all cases, the association between contact quantity and prejudice was moderated by its valence, with negative contact emerging as a stronger and more consistent predictor than positive contact. In Study 2, White Americans (n = 441) indicated how much positive and negative contact they had with Black Americans on separate measures. Although both quantity of positive and negative contact predicted racism and avoidance, negative contact was the stronger predictor. Furthermore, negative (but not positive) contact independently predicted suspicion about Barack Obama's birthplace. These results extend the contact hypothesis by issuing an important caveat: Negative contact may be more strongly associated with increased racism and discrimination than positive contact is with its reduction.

T1  - Prejudice in context departs from attitudes toward groups
AN  - 1417525012; 201331887
AB  - The analysis offered by Dixon et al. fails to acknowledge that the attitudes that drive prejudice are attitudes that are constructed in particular contexts. These attitudes (e.g., toward men as childcare workers) can diverge strongly from attitudes toward the group in general. Social change is thus best achieved through challenging the requirements of roles and by changing group stereotypes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond prejudice: Are negative evaluations the problem and is getting us to like one another more the solution?
AN  - 1417523728; 201331882
AB  - For most of the history of prejudice research, negativity has been treated as its emotional and cognitive signature, a conception that continues to dominate work on the topic. By this definition, prejudice occurs when we dislike or derogate members of other groups. Recent research, however, has highlighted the need for a more nuanced and "inclusive" (Eagly 2004) perspective on the role of intergroup emotions and beliefs in sustaining discrimination. On the one hand, several independent lines of research have shown that unequal intergroup relations are often marked by attitudinal complexity, with positive responses such as affection and admiration mingling with negative responses such as contempt and resentment. Simple antipathy is the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that nurturing bonds of affection between the advantaged and the disadvantaged sometimes entrenches rather than disrupts wider patterns of discrimination. Notably, prejudice reduction interventions may have ironic effects on the political attitudes of the historically disadvantaged, decreasing their perceptions of injustice and willingness to engage in collective action to transform social inequalities. These developments raise a number of important questions. Has the time come to challenge the assumption that negative evaluations are inevitably the cognitive and affective hallmarks of discrimination? Is the orthodox concept of prejudice in danger of side-tracking, if not obstructing, progress towards social justice in a fuller sense? What are the prospects for reconciling a prejudice reduction model of change, designed to get people to like one another more, with a collective action model of change, designed to ignite struggles to achieve intergroup equality? Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Liking more or hating less? A modest defence of intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417521669; 201331847
AB  - Here, I argue that Dixon et al. have overstated the prevalence of "benevolent" forms of prejudice; many stigmatised groups are currently the targets of overtly hostile evaluation and treatment by others (e.g., Muslims; immigrant groups). I also believe that the target article oversimplifies its presentation of prejudice researchers' primary theoretical and policy goals and that it overlooks important work in intergroup emotions.

T1  - CELEBRATING CROWN DAY AFTER THE 1990S SAXON MIGRATION: RECONFIGURATIONS OF ETHNICITY IN A SOUTH TRANSYLVANIAN VILLAGE
AN  - 1270251113
AB  - In this paper I discuss reconfigurations of ethnic relations in a village in South Transylvania following the migration of most of its Saxon population to Germany. I use the example of a yearly celebration, the Crown Day, to explore continuities and transformations in ethnic identities and relations between the remaining Saxons, Roma, and Romanians, and in particular transformations in what it means to be Saxon, in the village, in 2011. Using participant observation and formal and informal interviews about past and recent celebrations, I show how Crown Day serves as a site of performing and renegotiating historical legitimacy as well as a continued, albeit transformed, investment in the Saxonness of the village. I argue that the celebration continues to serve as a rehearsal of the local symbolic ethnic order, while mirroring the increasing dominance of the Romanian population as well as recent opportunities and obstacles in the transformation of the status of the local Roma. The symbolic and social space opened by non-Saxon participation in the festivities and their preparations represents an opportunity to confront and mitigate the social and cultural changes following the departure of their Saxon co-villagers. For all in the village, the Crown Days gives a way to discuss, instantiate, and act on the recent transformations in the village. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Irresponsible Radicalisation: Diasporas, Globalisation and Long-Distance Nationalism in the Digital Age
AN  - 2076977070
AB  - The growing scholarship on ethnic diasporas has prompted various off-shoots. Two significant directions are the relationship of diasporas with globalisation and their role in the expansion and radicalisation of ethnic conflict. The corporate enthusiasm of the 1990s for globalisation has been followed by sombre reflections on its destructive impact upon a vast array of areas, including inter-ethnic relations worldwide. This article explores one crucial aspect of this wave of disruption-the rapid expansion of radical forms of long-distance nationalism, often leading to a stress on maximalist goals and an abdication of responsibility. It conceptually distinguishes between stateless diasporas and diasporas that conceive themselves as tied to, and represented by, an existing 'nation-state'. Examples include ethnic lobbies from the former Yugoslavia, greater Han xenophobia among overseas Chinese, and Hindutva technocratic chauvinism among Hindu-Americans. Finally, the article identifies the onset of 'online mobbing' or 'cyber bullying' as a new and ominous trend in Internet radicalism.

T1  - "Treating" Prejudice: An Exposure-Therapy Approach to Reducing Negative Reactions Toward Stigmatized Groups
AN  - 1448998173; 201342794
AB  - One of the ways in which therapists treat anxiety disorders is to expose patients to a fear-evoking stimulus within a safe environment before encouraging more positive stimulus-related thoughts. In the study reported here, we adapted these psychotherapeutic principles of exposure therapy to test the hypothesis that imagining a positive encounter with a member of a stigmatized group would be more likely to promote positive perceptions when it was preceded by an imagined negative encounter. The results of three experiments targeting a range of stigmatized groups (adults with schizophrenia, gay men, and British Muslims) supported this hypothesis. Compared with purely positive interventions, interventions in which a single negative encounter was imagined just prior to imagining a positive encounter resulted in significantly reduced prejudice. Furthermore, reduced anxiety uniquely derived from the mixed-valence imagery task statistically explained enhanced intentions to engage positively with the previously stigmatized group in the future.

T1  - Accent and Prejudice: Israelis' Blind Assessment of Al-Jazeera English News Items
AN  - 1761674821; 201602161
AB  - To examine the interplay between ethnic bias and source credibility, we designed a blind experiment in which 112 Jewish-Israeli students rate the credibility and professionalism of videos broadcast by CNN, BBC, Fox News, and Al-Jazeera English (AJE) after removing identifying details. We then compared the results to a control group (N = 99) who viewed the videos untouched. Both the experiment and the control group rated AJE's material significantly lower on credibility and professionalism in comparison to the other networks' materials. Findings highlight the pervasive ethnocentrism of international news viewership and offer support for the 'hostile media perception' theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Confronting Hate: Heterosexuals' Responses to Anti-Gay Comments
AN  - 1373427388; 201328555
AB  - An online diary study was used to examine the individual and situational variables that influence non-targets' verbal and nonverbal reactions and responses to sexually prejudiced remarks. Results indicated that anti-gay comments were extremely prevalent in a college setting and resulted in a range of reactions and behaviors. Confrontation of the perpetrator was predicted by the perceived offensiveness of the comment, perceived social pressure to confront, and the number of close same-sex attracted friends. Additionally, those who confronted felt more satisfied with their responses than those who did not confront. Implications for future research and prejudice reduction strategies are discussed.

T1  - Social Identification Structures: The Effects of Perspective Taking
AN  - 1364700143; 201323599
AB  - Researchers who study perspective taking are generally optimistic about the potential for interventions to improve intergroup perceptions. The current research provides new insight into the conditions that frame the intergroup outcomes of perspective taking. The results show that the effects of perspective taking are not always positive but depend on perspective takers' degree of identification with the in-group. In two experiments, we demonstrated that adopting the perspective of an out-group member can have damaging effects on intergroup perceptions among group members who are highly identified with the in-group. Specifically, compared with less committed members, those who identified highly with the in-group used a greater number of negative traits to describe the out-group following perspective taking. Such perspective taking also led participants with high in-group identification to judge the out-group less favorably. Understanding how social identity concerns frame the outcome of perspective taking is crucial to its effective employment in intergroup-relations programs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Black Dutchman and the Racial Discourse of the Dutch in America, 1850-1920
AN  - 1347782674; 201318718
AB  - Following the American Civil War, a Dutch-American immigrant soldier returned to his home in Holland, Michigan, with a freed slave whom he had adopted. The adopted child, named Siras, was then raised in a Dutch immigrant household where he learned the Dutch language and the tenets of Dutch Calvinism. Although Siras was clearly well regarded by locals, he could not escape the racial stereotypes and prejudices of the Midwest and spent his entire adult life working as a hotel porter. Siras remained the only black man among the Dutch and a challenge for what it meant to be both Dutch and American. A micro-history of Siras, rooted in primary sources, sheds light on a larger discourse of Dutch-American ethnic and national identity. Dutch American immigrants of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries generally avoided contact with blacks, expressed implicit racial superiority, and defined themselves in reference to black as an 'other'.

T1  - The Iconic Ghetto
AN  - 1023026619; 201223768
AB  - In the minds of many Americans, the ghetto is where "the black people live," symbolizing an impoverished, crime-prone, drug-infested, and violent area of the city. Aided by the mass media and popular culture, this image of the ghetto has achieved an iconic status, and serves as a powerful source of stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. The history of racism in America, along with the ascription of "ghetto" to anonymous blacks, has burdened blacks with a negative presumption they must disprove before they can establish mutually trusting relationships with others. The poorest blacks occupy a caste-like status, and for the black middle class, contradictions and dilemmas of status are common, underscoring the racial divide and exacerbating racial tensions.

T1  - Religion and Civic Participation among the Children of Immigrants: Insights from the Postcolonial Portuguese Context
AN  - 2076973864
AB  - Religious mobilisation is a central aspect of ethno-cultural diversity in European societies. Focusing on the postcolonial Portuguese context, this article investigates the religious-civic activism of two groups of immigrant offspring living in the Greater Lisbon Area. Guiding research questions are the following: How is the religious mobilisation of immigrant youth associated both with degrees of social and cultural integration and with perceived conflict in inter-ethnic relations? To what extent is religious activism mediated by historical and cultural traditions related to specific gender and inter-generational dynamics? How do experiences of living out religion affect the multi-dimensional identity constructions of immigrant youth, and how do these ongoing identity processes promote strategies for ongoing action? Comparative analysis confirms that religious identities may create varied means and projects for civic activism, not only among children of immigrants who feel positively integrated but also among those who experience inter-ethnic conflict. Situated uses of religion require, however, a tacit knowledge concerning the civic and political context, and a certain capability of networking both within and beyond communities. The findings also reveal that youths' religious mobilisation is mediated by specific gender and inter-generational dynamics. The paper calls for further work on the impact of the various forms of trans-boundary 'positional moves' upon the identity projects of immigrant emergent generations, including those sustained by long-distance emotional and imagined relations.

T1  - Latinos' Perceptions of Interethnic Couples
AN  - 1023026942; 201223847
AB  - Numerous survey findings indicate that the majority of White Americans are accepting of interracial romantic relationships. However, relatively few studies have looked at how different American ethnic minority groups view such relationships. The current research examined Latinos' evaluations of intraethnic and interethnic couples. Latino participants (N = 207) read information about either a Latina-Latino, Latina-White, or Latina-Black romantic couple. The results indicate that the Latina-Black couple was evaluated less positively than the Latina-White couple on relationship quality and less positively than the other two couples on perceptions of social support. Latino men were especially likely to express negative emotions toward the Latina-Black couple compared with Latina women. The results are discussed in the context of intergroup relationships.

T1  - Deepening Non-Racialism in South Africa
AN  - 1221409547; 201244170
AB  - Through an analysis of the Kathrada Foundation/GCRO (Gauteng City-Region Observatory) focus groups transcript pack on non-racialism, it is shown that prevailing conceptions of non-racialism are tied to being 'colour-blind' and to being opposed to racial prejudice and discrimination. Such conceptions, it is revealed, are too contradictory and shallow to have any meaningful transformative effect. The article argues that a deeper, more sociologically valid conception of non-racialism can be constructed if attention is turned to critically relating non-racialism to the phenomenon of systemic racism, whereby racism is read as being structurally embedded in contemporary South African society.

T1  - Communicating One's Way to Employment: A Case Study of African Settlers in Brisbane, Australia
AN  - 1364705116; 201324070
AB  - This paper reports findings of an Australian study on cross-cultural communication and employment of several African birthplace groups of former refugees. The study was conducted in the greater Brisbane area in 2009 -- 10 and collected both quantitative (based on a short questionnaire) and qualitative (based on 12 focus groups) data. Drawing on the uncertainty reduction theory (URT), the segmented labour market theory (SLMT) and Bourdieu's concepts of linguistic and cultural capital, the paper focuses on cross-cultural communication aspects of job search (particularly the job interview situation), the workplace (communication with supervisors and co-workers) and overcoming linguistic and cultural obstacles in building bridging social networks. Existing power relations that structure the communication process, especially the 'symbolic power' aspect of Australian ethnic relations, are the context of our analysis. We also report on gender differences that additionally structure these processes in the job search and workplace contexts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Willful Stereotype Control. The Impact of Internal Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice on the Regulation of Activated Stereotypes
AN  - 1221406917; 201244022
AB  - Internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced leads to heightened control of stereotype activation. However, it is not clear whether internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced only reduces stereotype activation or whether individuals high internally motivated to behave nonprejudiced are also more successful in intentionally controlling already activated stereotypes. Two studies show that internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced when measured as well as when manipulated leads to more efficient control of activated stereotypes. This underlines the powerful potential of internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced to support the intentional control of previously activated stereotypes. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1018358002; 201212848
AB  - Not all biases are equivalent, and not all biases are uniformly negative. Two fundamental dimensions differentiate stereotyped groups in cultures across the globe: status predicts perceived competence, and cooperation predicts perceived warmth. Crossing the competence and warmth dimensions, two combinations produce ambivalent prejudices: pitied groups (often traditional women or older people) appear warm but incompetent, and envied groups (often nontraditional women or outsider entrepreneurs) appear competent but cold. Case studies in ambivalent sexism, heterosexism, racism, anti-immigrant biases, ageism, and classism illustrate both the dynamics and the management of these complex but knowable prejudices.

T1  - Discourses of gender and nationalism in early twentieth-century Germany and Ireland: an analysis of four nationalist women's texts
AN  - 1531931252; 201423295
AB  - Horan presents a linguistic analysis of four texts by leading women nationalists in Germany and Ireland in the early twentieth century, and argues that women instrumentalize gender to construct their own nationalist narratives and establish their legitimacy within dominant discourses. Drawing on critical discourse analysis, particularly the discourse historical approach devised by Ruth Wodak and her colleagues, she identifies discursive strategies common to all four texts, including constructive strategies, strategies of justification, and dismantling or destructive strategies. In particular, the analysis focuses on the way in which German and Irish women nationalists both drew on and challenged dominant gendered stereotypes and symbols, creating positive 'in-groups' and stigmatized 'out-groups' around which concepts of nationhood and national identity cohered.

T1  - The Biphobia Scale a Decade Later: Reflections and Additions
AN  - 1125224505; 201240464
AB  - Biphobia, which has been defined as negative attitudes about bisexuality and bisexual individuals, is a psychological construct that is, at present, not well understood. Ochs described the denigration that bisexual individuals face as "double discrimination," which she defined as discrimination from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. A 30-item instrument, the Biphobia Scale, was developed to measure negative cognitions, affects and behaviors regarding bisexuality and bisexual individuals. The instrument has provided empirical support for the existence of the construct of biphobia and suggests that it exists in the heterosexual and homosexual communities. The results support the theory that bisexual individuals are subjected to "double discrimination.". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Two Faces of Liberalism: Islam in Contemporary Europe
AN  - 896164319; 201120143
AB  - This article addresses long-standing normative claims that liberalism-understood as the priority of economic and political liberty, neutrality in the public sphere, the universal application of human rights, and the requirement to treat all subjects equally-is inadequate in the context of deep, migration-driven diversity. Beginning with the assumption that liberalism-as-an-integration-paradigm must be evaluated empirically, the article examines the immigration experience of two liberal states: France and the United States. Evidence from these important countries of immigration demonstrates that universal, difference-blind policies that are suspicious of claims to difference in the public sphere reduce prejudice and promote positive intra-community attitudes (France), while limited income support and dynamic labour markets promote economic integration (the United States). Far from being an inadequate relic of a simpler age, liberalism is the best framework for accommodating diverse societies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Illiberal Means to Liberal Ends? Understanding Recent Immigrant Integration Policies in Europe
AN  - 896164316; 201120194
AB  - A number of European governments have pronounced multiculturalism a failure and opted for more aggressive means of integrating immigrants into their societies. This paper asks what we are to make of this trend: does it reflect deeply rooted illiberal prejudice or a novel shift in liberal-democratic states' approaches to nation-building? I suggest that aggressive integrationism is reflective of a distinctly 'Schmittian' liberalism, which aims to clarify the core values of liberal societies and use coercive state power to protect them from illiberal and putatively dangerous groups. In contrast to liberal multiculturalists, who counsel accommodation, compromise and negotiation among majority and minority groups, Schmittian liberals see the task of immigrant integration as part of a broader campaign to preserve 'Western civilisation' from illiberal threats. Their framing of the problem in existentialist terms allows them to justify policies that might otherwise be seen to contravene liberal principles of toleration and equality. As such, Schmittian liberalism complicates our understanding of liberal states' approaches to immigration and immigrant integration policies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - SOCIAL DISTANCES OF WHITES TO RACIAL OR ETHNIC MINORITIES
AN  - 1466281931
AB  - Prior research on social distance between racial or ethnic groups in the United States has focused mainly on attitudes of white Americans toward African Americans. Extending previous research, this study analyzes social distances of whites to racial or ethnic minority groups by investigating how whites feel about blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. The main hypothesis is that whites feel coolest toward blacks, warmest toward Asians, and somewhat in between toward Hispanics. The 2002 General Social Survey and ordinary least squares regression are used to test the hypothesis. The results indicate that contrary to our hypothesis, whites feel coolest toward Asians, warmest toward Hispanics, and somewhat in between toward blacks. Nativity, religious similarity/ dissimilarity, racial hierarchy and tension, proximity of the country of origin, and group diversity may offer plausible explanations for the unexpected result. This study also examines which types of whites are more likely to maintain a greater or smaller social distance with the three minority groups. Implications of the findings for race and ethnic relations today are addressed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racist Nativism in the 21st Century
AN  - 1018340932; 201212866
AB  - Since the 1960s, academia and the public have frequently used racism as the catch-all phrase to explain any racial or ethnic injustice identified in America. However, are the disparities domestic minorities face the same as those faced by immigrant minorities? For example, journalists have suggested that the various state immigration policies targeting Hispanic immigrants in the United States recently are as racist as the Jim Crow laws enacted decades ago. In this essay, I contend that while nativism and racism are kissing cousins, distinguishing and using these concepts may lend to more precise explanations of the issues many racial and ethnic minorities face who exist outside of the Black-White dichotomy that has traditionally characterized United States. To untangle these terms, I review recent scholarship to provide up-to-date definitions, as well as reintroduce the concept of 'racist nativism' to better explain the variability that characterizes racial or ethnic prejudice and discrimination in 21st century America.

T1  - Dry land drowning or rip current survival? Haitians without status in the Bahamas
AN  - 887495897; 201118078
AB  - Recent scholarship contends that collective action emerges when human rights are violated. This article investigates why Haitians without status in the Bahamas have yet to mobilize collectively for basic rights and protections, despite discrimination and exploitation. The article examines two analogies to explain their immobilization. The analogy of dry land drowning utilizes Goffman's Stigma (1963) framework to describe how social prejudice hinders the ability of Haitians without status to act, while the analogy of rip current survival explains how institutional drawbacks pull Haitians without status away from movement activity through a political process analysis. The article contends that both interpretations are inadequate when taken alone and provides suggestions for future research into Bahamian-Haitian relations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Citizenship and multiple belonging. Representations of inclusion, identification and participation among children of immigrants in Italy
AN  - 1125218227; 201240380
AB  - This article aims to explore how children of immigrants enrolled in higher secondary schools in Milan conceive and speak about citizenship. It illustrates how the formal, participatory and identity dimensions of citizenship come to be articulated in a complex and changeable way in relation to discourses and contexts. In particular, it attempts to look more closely at the transformations of belonging, which today seems to be composed of different layers that underline different aspects: admittance stresses the universalistic claim to be equal, to not be excluded on the basis of discrimination or prejudice; identification conserves a particularistic and essentialist meaning, it stresses the importance and the 'unavoidableness' of difference; involvement regards lifestyles, everyday relations, it confers importance on the possibility to participate on behalf of a specific interest and have a stake in a community's life and future. Therefore, citizenship assumes different meanings when discourses shift from one layer to another. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The typification of Hispanics as criminals and support for punitive crime control policies
AN  - 887498555; 201118218
AB  - The Hispanic population is now the largest and fastest growing minority in the United States, so it is not surprising that ethnic threat linked to Hispanics has been associated with harsher crime control. While minority threat research has found that individuals who associate blacks with crime are more likely to support harsh criminal policies, the possibility that this relationship exists for those who typify Hispanics as criminal has yet to be examined. Using a national random sample, this study is the first to use HLM to find that perceptions of Hispanics as criminals do increase support for punitive crime control measures, controlling for various individual and state influences. Moderated and contextual analyses indicate this relationship is most applicable for individuals who are less apt to typify criminals as black, less prejudiced, less fearful of victimization, politically liberal or moderate, not parents, and living in states with relatively fewer Latin American immigrants.

T1  - "Color Coding" and Support for Social Policy Spending: Assessing the Parameters among Whites
AN  - 862595921; 201109747
AB  - This study uses data from the 1996 through 2002 General Social Survey to examine whether one variant of modern racial prejudice -- "color coding" -- explains support for several ostensibly nonracial government spending policies regarding crime,urban problems, and drug addiction (welfare and race spending are used as baseline measures). Findings indicate that color coding does not extend appreciably beyond its established focus of welfare and race and operates along a continuum with welfare and race at one end (heavily influenced by prejudice), addiction spending and urban spending at the other end (not influenced by prejudice), and crime spending situated in the middle (moderately influenced by prejudice). Possible causes of the continuum, as well as emerging aspects of the color coding phenomenon -- specifically, its possible bidirectional effects and its subordination to political party affiliation in explanatory value -- are discussed. Directions for future research that would shed additional light on the color coding phenomenon are also discussed.

T1  - Perceptions Of Racial Discrimination Among Black Professionals In Rio De Janeiro
AN  - 914767769; 201200143
AB  - Most Brazilians believe that racial and socioeconomic inequalities tend to overlap -- in other words, blacks are poorer because they have less education and worse jobs. In the past few years, however, several quantitative studies have presented an interesting puzzle: racial inequalities are strongest among those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy. This article explores the "elitist profile" of racial discrimination through eighty in-depth interviews with black professionals in Rio de Janeiro. The results show that interviewees describe their trajectories of social mobility through mechanisms that involve both socioeconomic and racial exclusion. Their perceptions of injustice, however, are more directly related to experiences of racial discrimination. In narrating incidents of discrimination, interviewees stress the distinction and tensions between what we call generalized prejudice and particularized universalism.

AN  - 902082837; 201122272
AB  - From the time of his nomination as the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential candidate onwards, Barack Obama was the target of a panoply of political attacks. Conservatives, Republicans and even some Democrats played on his alterity in a way that previous non-white political hopefuls, particularly the Reverend Jesse Jackson, had not had to endure. If the intricate twists and turns of Obama's past did not make those attacks particularly surprising, the way in which he chose to deal with them was. In what stands as a deliberate pre-emptive attack, Obama used two substantive texts, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, to create and shape a historical narrative of his own past in such a way as to present himself to the US voting public as a truly American figure, worthy of the presidency. By the time he was running for high office, therefore, Obama had already used his knowledge of the discipline of history to create a usable past with which he and his supporters could denude many of those political attacks of their potency, whether they were focused on the years of his upbringing in an Islamic state, his familial ties to Kenya, his religious background or his purported links to radicalism.

T1  - Regulating Islamophobia: The Need for Collecting Disaggregated Data on Racism in Ireland
AN  - 1081862695; 201235198
AB  - Over the past 20 years, not only has Europe witnessed an increasing prominence of right-wing political groups, European governments have also moved to regulate Muslims and how they practice their faith. Contrary to this negative form of regulation, I propose through drawing on the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault that the agencies of European governments -- focusing here on the government of Ireland -- can regulate the societal position of Muslims in a manner that protects against Islamophobia. Islamic communities in Ireland are rich in their cultural and religious diversity. Nevertheless, there exists a paucity of data vis-a-vis Muslims and their experience of racism in Ireland. Put in an international context, Muslims are increasingly vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination on the basis of their faith and the ascribed negative imagery. I contend that the effective collection of data by State agencies is not only necessary to gauge levels of Islamophobia in Ireland, but that this data would also increase the effectiveness of State policies. Furthermore, I contend that if Islamophobia is to be challenged, moves must be made to pathologize this form of racism. This can be achieved by the systematic collection of disaggregated data that illuminates the levels of Islamophobia that exist in society. Effective data collection of this sort could be instrumental in increasing the utility of future State policies designed to combat racist sentiment directed towards Muslims as propagated by right-wing groups and others.

T1  - Dimensions of collectivism: occupation, community and the increasing role of memory and personal dynamics in the debate
AN  - 1018343037; 201213192
AB  - This essay argues that the notion of there being a decline in collectivism does not adequately engage with a whole new set of initiatives within labour process theory on collectivism in its various forms. These debates demonstrate how diverse social influences and experiences, and the memory of previous experiences and collective endeavours, are essential features that must be acknowledged in terms of their implications. There are series of interventions on occupational identity, the everyday lives of workers, gender and ethnic relations and the experience of work that nourish our understanding of collectivism as a more complex and broader concept. Furthermore, how features and relations are mobilized, linked and developed is becoming a vital feature of how collectivism should be understood. It is argued that the nature of these relations needs to be a greater focus of the debate if we are to develop a more dynamic view of collectivism, and a more relevant one.

AN  - 1010632402; 201210495
AB  - The United States has set the pattern of Oriental exclusion for such countries as Canada and Australia. On the Pacific Coast, and in California especially, a distinct and rather involved racial situation has developed; perhaps it may be thought of as the completion of a "race-relations cycle." Here, because of the rapid cultural advancement of these colored people, the natural history of race relations has been greatly expedited. Like all racial situations, we approach this one also from the point of view of the white man's initiative -- he is the actor in chief; the Asiatics react to their best advantage.

T1  - Nixon and the Jews
AN  - 835111641; 201100575
AB  - In public the 37th President of the United States did not express hostility or disparagement, or show any signs of religious prejudice towards Jews. But inside the White House, Richard M. Nixon's remarks were often scurrilous. His antisemitism was not casual; it was close to compulsive. And it could be coupled with other seething grievances, for example, towards liberals, radicals, the media, Blacks and Italian-Americans. Yet Nixon controlled his antisemitism. It had no adverse effect on Jewish life, either at home or abroad. The malice that he nurtured remained unmobilized. Apart from a few limited personnel instances (mostly but not completely ignored by Nixon's underlings), it is impossible to connect private resentment to public policy, probably because the barriers to the expression of antisemitism in the United States have been so high. The ugliness of his utterances in the Oval Office revealed his character, but did not extend outward to shape the processes of governance. A disconnect can therefore be discerned between what he felt and how he acted. Most American Jews voted for Nixon's Democratic opponents in 1968 and 1972. But even Jews who voted against him, even those who loathed him, have often acknowledged that Nixon's policies fortified the security of Israel; and he was proud of his support for the Jewish state during the Yom Kippur War. What betrayed Nixon, and what forced him to resign the presidency, was his decision to instal a secret taping system in the Oval Office. When the tapes were played in 1974, he showed himself to be conspiring to obstruct justice. In subsequent years, further exposure of the tapes revealed the extent and intensity of Nixon's antipathy to Jews. The expletives that had to be deleted did much to besmirch the dignity of the office. But such was the stigma the political culture attached to antisemitism that, had his bigotry become public before 1968, Nixon's career would have been over. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - New Immigrant Destinations And Occupational Sorting: Patterns Of Stratification Across Race And Ethnicity
AN  - 1429627686; 201337070
AB  - Immigration has long been a source of demographic change in the United States and it has transformed race and ethnic relations throughout U.S. history. Over the last 20 to 30 years, these changes have begun to affect new localities as immigrants leave traditional hubs such as New York City and Los Angeles in substantial numbers. Consequently, in some metropolitan areas, as well as states, inter-group relations, including occupational sorting, are taking on new shapes. In this analysis, we make use of 2008 American Community Survey data for six emerging immigrant destinations: Atlanta, Dallas-Fort Worth, Las Vegas, Orlando, Phoenix, and Washington DC. We concentrate substantively on occupational sorting among foreign- and native-born individuals. Our results indicate an occupational queue in most of these areas in which whites remain at the top; however, some foreign-born Asian groups have made inroads into primary occupations. Other groups-especially African Americans and foreign-born Mexicans-remain further down the occupational queue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Europe, the Final Solution and the dynamics of intent
AN  - 758123917; 201056873
AB  - The scale and scope of the 'final solution' of the 'Jewish question' were extreme even in the horrific annals of genocide. Bloxham attempts to shed light on the pattern of mass murder in its expansion and contraction by viewing the Holocaust in a set of temporally and culturally specific contexts. It places the Holocaust into a broader European framework of violent ethnopolitics and geopolitics from the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century. The Holocaust is depicted as an only partially discrete part of a continental process of traumatic flux, and a part, furthermore, that can itself be partially disaggregated into national and regional components. Bloxham moves from a general consideration of patterns of ethnic violence in the period to a closer causal explanation that shows the different valences of Nazi policy towards Jews in the lands directly ruled by Germany and those of Germany's allies respectively. He shows that the peculiarly extensive ambitions of the 'final solution' at its most expansive can only be explained when wider geopolitical and strategic contextual terms are factored in along with consideration of Nazi ideology and the internal dynamics of some of the key institutions of the perpetrator state.

T1  - Intergroup Anxiety in Interracial Interaction: The Role of Prejudice and Metastereotypes
AN  - 743055527; 201043248
AB  - Intergroup contact is known to promote positive intergroup relations. However, in natural settings race groups tend to self-segregate. Prejudice and metaperceptions are hypothesized to act as barriers to mixing. The experiment reported in this article investigates the role of prejudice and metastereotypes in producing the intergroup anxiety experienced in a simulated contact situation. The experiment was replicated at three different universities and involved different combinations of race groups. Participants believed that they were communicating in an Internet chatroom with two other students, who were either of the same or of a different race to themselves. Participants' level of prejudice and degree of negative metastereotypes were both found to be predictors of the intergroup anxiety experienced in this interaction, with metastereotypes emerging as more important. The implications of these results for addressing negative intergroup relations in South Africa are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Population Ratios and Prejudice: Modelling Both Contact and Threat Effects
AN  - 2076975549
AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations.

T1  - Sade's revenge: racial neoliberalism and the sovereignty of negation
AN  - 743065709; 201043258
AB  - The present moment in US politics is one marked by a number of stark contradictions. Foremost among them is the popular perception that the nation's vicious legacy of racial exclusion and exploitation has been recognized and largely redressed through civil-rights-era advances and is now officially consigned to the past with the 2008 presidential election of Barack Obama while, at the same time, racially indexed humiliation, harassment, violence and 'civilizational war' ruthlessly persist. A corollary paradox resides in a renewed belief in the pre-eminence of American values, moral leadership and purity of purpose, and the sadistic impulses that simultaneously course through the national culture, energizing its corporatism, militarism, religious fundamentalism, its punishment empire and its vast entertainment industry. Giroux examines the work of David Theo Goldberg, one of the world's most eminent philosophers of race, whose recent contribution The Threat of Race offers a new analytics and critical vocabulary to illuminate these tensions with unparalleled historical precision and theoretical sophistication. Because, as Goldberg rightly maintains, the pervasive contemporary commitment to 'racial neoliberalism' is predicated on historical amnesia, Giroux seeks to offer a comparative examination of present and past 'times of terror'. In specific, she moves between late eighteenth-century and early twenty-first-century expressions of sovereign imagination and the claims to honour and virtue that subtend their policies of isolation, segregation, punishment, brutalization, torture and murder. The self-assigned moral imperative to 'rid the world of evil' comes increasingly to mean a declaration of war on a world of Others racially conceived, a project that invariably ends in the will to self-destruction.
