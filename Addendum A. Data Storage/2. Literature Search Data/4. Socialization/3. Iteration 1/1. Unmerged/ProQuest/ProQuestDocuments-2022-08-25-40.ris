T1  - Intracultural and Intercultural Contact Orientation of International Students in Japan: Uncertainty Management by Cultural Identification
AN  - 2705823100
AB  - The lack of exchange between international students and host nationals in Japan has long been a pressing issue, yet very little progress has been made to rectify this situation. In this study, we examined this issue by focusing on how international students in Japan perceive cultural contact with their host and home culture members during their sojourn. The study applied a qualitative approach based on grounded theory, collecting data through semi-structured interviews with 41 international students from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. According to the social identity and anxiety/uncertainty management approach, we interpreted the findings on how international students manage uncertainty in the Japanese environment by identifying with the host and their own home cultures for their psychological well-being, which we distinguished as intercultural or intracultural contact orientation. International students demonstrated an intracultural rather than intercultural contact orientation due to the host nationals reacting to them as "foreigners/'

T1  - A Case Study of Personal Experiences of Undocumented Eastern European Immigrants Living in the United States
AN  - 2678856929
AB  - Abstract. Existing research on undocumented migration has focused predominantly on Latin American and Mexican immigrants and largely overlooked the experiences of immigrants originating from other parts of the world. As such, very few studies have considered how the lack of legal residency status can influence life opportunities of undocumented immigrants from Eastern Europe. The overarching aim of the present study was to explore the personal experiences of unauthorized Eastern European immigrants in the United States in order to: (a) augment research on undocumented migration, and (b) highlight the experiences of undocumented Eastern Europeans who remain an under-studied group of immigrants. Comprehensive personal interviews were conducted with a small group of unauthorized immigrants to explore: (1) reasons for immigration and prior expectations, and (2) psychosocial experiences (i.e., status related anxiety, experience with prejudice and discrimination, job satisfaction, sense of belonging, family relations, and future plans). Some of the results are presented in terms of similarities and differences between the current study's sample and the undocumented immigrants from other regions of the world, namely, Mexico and Latin America.

T1  - Group-Focused Enmity - Conceptual, Longitudinal, and Cross-National Perspectives Based on Pre-registered Studies
AN  - 2660147445
AB  - Group-Focused Enmity describes the idea that different outgroup-specific prejudices can be aggregated to a larger syndrome of inequality-based derogation of others. This focus section brings together three studies on Group-Focused Enmity that had been registered and peer-reviewed before they were conducted. All of the reports advance the Group-Focused Enmity literature in important ways and demonstrate the fruitfulness of the concept. They also show that using sophisticated methods can help us to address novel and exciting questions, and demonstrate the opportunities that preregistration offers for studies analysing secondary data.

T1  - Unobserved Heterogeneity between Individuals in Group-Focused Enmity
AN  - 2660147429
AB  - Group-focused enmity (CFE) and related research have mostly focused on variable-centred analyses such as structural equation modelling and factor analysis, implicitly assuming that the results apply uniformly to all participants in the sample. Person-centred research questions and analysis methods, which investigate unobserved heterogeneity in the sample, have been lacking in CFE research. Nonetheless, initial evidence exists from research on Islamophobia and CFE that various unobserved latent classes (i.e., subgroups) differing in their average prejudice can be identified within one dataset. In this manuscript, we applied factor mixture modelling to investigate unobserved heterogeneity using the data of the German CFE survey 2011. We found two latent classes of equivalent factor-analytical composition with consistently high versus low expressions of target-specific prejudice. No comparison of latent CFE means was possible. Membership in the high prejudice latent class was associated with higher age, right-wing political orientation, high right-wing authoritarianism and high social dominance orientation. Our findings demonstrate the importance of exploring unobserved heterogeneity in attitudes research and outline how person-centred research can complement variable-centred research in order to understand social-psychological phenomena.1

T1  - Prejudice and Cuts to Public Health and Education: A Migration Crisis or a Crisis of the European Welfare State and Its Socio-Political Values?
AN  - 2653018733
AB  - The past few years have witnessed the development of prejudiced attitudes in some places in Europe. Biases alike are often considered a consequence of increased migratory movements to the continent and have also been connected to a more general crisis of the European Union political project. However, societies have diversely responded to migration even in countries presenting similar economic performances and immigrant inflows. Akin different reactions have raised some important questions: is prejudice connected to a broader European crisis and what does the latter consist of? This article responds to these research questions through a multilevel analysis of 24 European countries, and shows that the percentages of migrant population alone are not associated to anti-migrant sentiments. Such a situation has instead been the case only in those countries that have concurrently experienced cuts to the two key public sectors of education and health care, which constituted the pillars of the European Welfare State and one of the cores of the European Union’s political project.

TT  - Análisis del discurso de odio en función de la ideología: Efectos emocionales y cognitivos
AN  - 2642950866
AB  - El discurso de odio constituye un importante problema, especialmente en el entorno político, donde genera polarización y conflicto social. No existen trabajos experimentales de laboratorio que hayan analizado sus mecanismos de acción empleando registros biométricos para evaluar la emoción negativa implícita provocada por estos discursos, a pesar de la importancia esencial de la emoción en este problema. El objetivo de este trabajo es investigar, en una muestra universitaria, la interacción entre la ideología del emisor y el receptor (progresista vs. conservador) y el tipo de mensaje (odio vs. no-odio) sobre las cogniciones (percepción de credibilidad del mensaje y del emisor) y la emoción negativa (biométrica y auto-informada). La emoción biométrica se evaluó mediante registros de la variabilidad intercardíaca y la respuesta dermoeléctrica. Los resultados destacan la importancia de evaluar las respuestas biométricas implícitas que revelan datos inaccesibles con otras metodologías: los conservadores muestran mayor emoción en sus registros biométricos que en los auto-informados. También se detectan, con estas medidas, efectos de desensibilización del odio en ambas audiencias. Con medidas auto-informadas, se detecta mayor emoción negativa en las audiencias progresistas solo cuando el emisor es contrario a su ideología. En cambio, los conservadores manifiestan menor emoción negativa en todos los casos. Se interpretan estos resultados como consecuencia de la presión normativa y de sesgos endogrupales de conformidad.Alternate abstract:Hate speech is a major problem, especially in the political environment, where it generates polarization and social conflict. There are no experimental laboratory studies that have analyzed the mechanisms of action of hate speech using biometric records to evaluate the implicit negative emotion caused by these discourses, despite the essential importance of emotion in this problem. This work investigates the interaction between the ideology of the source and the audience (progressive vs. conservative) and the type of message (hate vs. non-hate) on cognitions (perception of the veracity of the message and the source) and negative emotion (biometric and self-reported). Biometric emotion was assessed by recording heart rate variability and electrodermal response. The results highlight the importance of evaluating implicit biometric responses that reveal inaccessible data with other methodologies: conservatives show more emotion in their biometric records than in self-reported ones. 'With these measures, hate desensitization effects are also detected in both audiences. 'With self-reported measures, more negative emotion is detected in progressive audiences only when the source is contrary to their ideology; on the other hand, conservatives show less negative emotion in all cases. These results are interpreted as a consequence of normative pressure and endogroup cognitive biases.

T1  - The effect of the 2020 racial justice protests on attitudes and preferences in rural and urban America
AN  - 2642201408
AB  - ObjectiveThis paper seeks to understand the impact of sustained protests for racial justice on attitudes toward racial minorities, the police, and policies that would benefit racial minorities.MethodsUsing a large, nationally representative survey collected before and after the death of George Floyd and the protest movement that followed it, I employ a propensity score matching to identify the causal impact of these protests on perceptions of discrimination against blacks, favorability of the police, racial prejudice, and support for reparations for slavery. I also identify heterogeneous effects in rural America to identify the limits of these attitude shifts.ResultsI find evidence that George Floyd's death caused an increased perception of discrimination against blacks, decreased favorability of the police, decreased racial prejudice, and increased support for reparations. I also find muted and heterogeneous effects in rural America.ConclusionThese findings speak to the power of social protest to shift attitudes and policy preferences and to the persistent divide between urban and rural Americans.

T1  - Age Diversity Climate Affecting Individual-Level Work-Related Outcomes
AN  - 2637699070
AB  - The present study answers the call for more studies to investigate the age diversity climate’s effect on individual-level outcomes. Building on the social identity approach and social exchange theory, we surveyed 110 Italian employees aged between 18 and 61 years old (M = 46.10, SD = 10.02) and investigated the role of age diversity climate in predicting intentions to quit (H1), job-related wellbeing (H2), and work engagement (H3). Our findings confirmed the hypotheses (H1 and H2), showing the added effect of age diversity climate over and above age, job tenure, role clarity, job demands, job control, perceived support, and perceived job and organizational fit. In fact, age diversity climate accounted for a significant increase in the variance explained for two of the three hypothesized models (i.e., intentions to quit and job-related wellbeing, but not work engagement). To conclude, this study contributes to the existing literature by showing the age diversity climate’s predictive value for turnover intentions and job-related wellbeing, and corroborating the importance of supporting age diversity through a variety of Human Resources Management strategies.

T1  - Problematising mainstream Spanish antiracism: race, racism and whiteness
AN  - 2631378504
AB  - In Spain, (anti-)racism is of scarce relevance to public debates and, when the topic is broached, it has mainly been discussed in relation to non-EU migration. Besides, its historical link with colonialism generally remains unacknowledged. This article analyses the problematisation of ‘race’ and ‘racism’ in this context, as performed by hegemonic stakeholders (i.e. public servants, NGOs, experts) in the fields of anti-discrimination, Roma inclusion and immigrant integration policies. As the fieldwork materials illustrate, this understanding rejects ‘race’ not only from a scientific-biological perspective but also as a social-political category. Accordingly, racism is depoliticised and theorised in a twofold manner: (1) as a matter of stereotypes, prejudices and lack of information about the ‘Other’; (2) as the aggressive acts of explicitly racist individuals/organisations. The structural, historical and institutional dimensions of racism are addressed either as background context, or they are negated by public policies. By not confronting the uneven power relations (re)produced by racism, this approach reaffirms ‘institutional whiteness’ as the underlying perspective of mainstream Spanish anti-racism.

T1  - Çalışma Hayatında Cinsiyet Ayrımcılığı ve Türk İş Hukukunda Kadınları Korumaya Yönelik Düzenlemeler
TT  - Gender Discrimination in Working Life and Regulations to Protect Women in Turkish Labor Law
AN  - 2630302751
AB  - Kadınlar yüzyıllar boyunca çalışma hayatında var olabilmek adına çeşitli mücadeleler vermiştir. Günümüz koşulları değerlendirildiğinde toplumsal yapının değişmeye başlaması ve ülke ekonomisinin sürdürülebilir kalkınması adına kadın işgücünün ne kadar önemli olduğu gerçeği açıkça ortadadır. Ancak bu gerçekliğe rağmen günümüzde çalışma hayatında kadınlar cinsiyet ayrımcılığı başta olmak üzere çeşitli sorunlarla karşılaşmaya devam etmektedir. Bu doğrultuda hem kamusal alanda yüzyıllardır süregelen eril hâkimiyet ve bunun getirdiği toplumsal ön yargılar, hem kadınların fiziksel açıdan erkeklere nazaran daha güçsüz olması hem de ağırlıklı olarak aile içi sorumlulukların kadınlarda olması, kadınlara özgü koruyucu yasal düzenlemeleri gerekli kılmaktadır. Bu noktadan hareketle çalışma kapsamında 4857 sayılı İş Kanunu'nun kadınları korumaya yönelik öngördüğü düzenlemeler incelemeye tabi tutulmuştur. İş Kanunu kapsamındaki bu düzenlemeler çalışan kadınları korumaya yönelik açıkça hükümler öngörse de bu hükümlerin hayata geçirilmesi gerektiği ve bunun için de toplumdaki her bir bireyden yönetişim ağı içerisindeki her bir kuruluşa önemli görevler düşmektedir.Alternate abstract:Women have struggled for centuries in order to exist in working life. When today's conditions are evaluated, it is obvious how important the female workforce is for the social structure to begin to change and for the sustainable development of the country's economy. However, despite this reality, women continue to face various problems in working life, especially gender discrimination. In this direction, both the masculine dominance in the public sphere for centuries and the social prejudices brought by it, both the fact that women are physically weaker than men and that women have predominantly domestic responsibilities, necessitate protective legal regulations specific to women. From this point of view, within the scope of the study, the regulations stipulated by the Labor Law No. 4857 to protect women were examined. Although these regulations within the scope of the Labor Law clearly envisage provisions to protect working women, these provisions must be implemented, and within this, every individual in the society and every organization within the governance network have important duties.

T1  - E. M. Forster's A Passage to India: A Tragedy of Cultural Conflicts and Distorted Interracial Relationships
AN  - 2620024311
AB  - E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, hereafter (API), offers us an opportunity to realize the mentality of the white imperialist and the grotesque picture of the colonizer-colonized relationship; this picture implies multiple facets of racial vituperations, brutality, and prejudice perpetrated on Indians in the colonial period. In the novel, Forster explores the colonizers' racist attitudes, and he brings out the racial and interracial conflicts as well as the cultural and ethnic traumas between the colonizer and the colonized. This study is primarily concerned with exploring the cultural clashes and the problematic, deformed interracial relationships, established between the Indians and the Anglo-Indians in a colonial context. The analytical approach and the Postcolonial Theory will be adopted throughout the paper as a framework. A postcolonial reading of the novel debunks the colonizer's racist ideology and reveals various motifs of partitions, fences, interracial conflicts and gulfs. The article reveals that the different racial, cultural, and social backgrounds of the English and Indian communities create bitter differences and significant gaps that cannot be bridged. The study concludes that the ramifications of the interracial clashes and racial intolerance have a vehement impact on both the colonized and the colonizer alike; however, mutual and interracial love, respect, and understanding are robust solutions that can relatively open the ideological closure of racism, lessen the racial tensions and thus bring people of different racial backgrounds together.

T1  - Humanizing racialization: Social psychology in a time of unexpected transformational conjunctions
AN  - 2617655082
AB  - The unexpected transformations produced by the conjunction of COVID‐19, the murder of George Floyd and the resurgence of Black Lives Matter highlight the importance of social psychological understandings and the need for a step change in theorization of the social. This paper focuses on racialization. It considers issues that social psychology needs to address in order to reduce inequalities and promote social justice. It draws on theoretical resources of intersectionality and hauntology to illuminate the ways in which social psychological research frequently makes black people visible in ways that exclude them from normative constructions. The final main part of the paper presents an analysis of an interview with the racing driver Lewis Hamilton to illustrate possible ways of humanizing racialization by giving recognition to the multiplicity and historical location of racialized positioning. The paper argues that, while social psychology has made vital contributions to the understanding of group processes and of racisms, there remains a need to humanize racialization by conducting holistic analyses of black people’s (and others’) intersectional identities.

T1  - Political-Pedagogical Character of the Collective Actions of the Popular Bars
AN  - 2621567069
AB  - Barrismo is a complex phenomenon and cannot be defined universally. Social representation is based on deficient conceptions that relate it to the use of psychoactive substances and violence. This article presents qualitative research evidence based on the epistemological assumptions of social constructionism, a hermeneutical phenomenological design and the use of qualitative interview and documentary and audiovisual review, to understand the politicalpedagogical character of the collective actions of the popular bars of the city of Medellín, Colombia, as practices that contribute to the transformation of the territories. Categories found: i. Bars as popular movements: transition from the brave bar to the popular bar, and ii. Collective actions: Barrismo Social. The bars have gone from rough bars to popular bars, from political and critical reflexivity, with collective actions for the transformation of the territories, which transcends the experience of stigma and social prejudice.

T1  - Prejudice in Turkey and Belgium: The cross‐cultural comparison of correlations of right‐wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation with sexism, homophobia, and racism
AN  - 2614034308
AB  - Using data from Turkey and Belgium, this study investigated the relationships of right‐wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation with ambivalent sexism, homophobia, and subtle racism. First, we predicted that men are more prejudiced than women. This hypothesis was confirmed in the Turkish but not in the Belgian sample. Second, Muslims were higher in authoritarianism and homophobia than people belonging to other (or no) religious groups. Third, Muslims also showed more hostile sexism toward both men and women. Fourth, negative associations of education with authoritarianism, sexism, and homophobia were expected and found. Fifth, in both countries, authoritarianism was positively related to homophobia and sexism, and social dominance orientation was positively associated with racism. Finally, groups comparing both samples, we found that Turks’ authoritarianism and prejudice was higher than Belgians’. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

T1  - Evidence of a dynamic association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence: GPIR
AN  - 2609041392
AB  - Three studies explored the association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence. Study 1 and Study 2 provided evidence of a cross-sectional association between intergroup contact and intercultural competence in which positive contact was associated with increased intercultural competence and negative contact was associated with reductions in this outcome. In Study 3, longitudinal data allowed us to test the possibility of mutual influence between these variables whereby intercultural competence is not only a consequence of intergroup contact but is also predictive of the quality of future intergroup contact. Results showed that positive contact was longitudinally associated with improvements in intercultural competence, and that higher intercultural competence was associated with a reduction in future negative contact. Findings speak to the importance of taking a dynamic outlook on contact effects. The beneficial consequences of positive contact may be the same variables capable of transforming future contact encounters and reducing the likelihood of negative interactions.

T1  - Individual and situational predictors of intention to hire gay male and ultra-orthodox male job applicants
TT  - Individual and situational predictors
AN  - 2585253241
AB  - PurposeThis paper examines personal and situational factors that may contribute to biases in hiring decisions at the workplace, focusing on willingness to hire male gay or male Jewish ultra-Orthodox Jewish job candidates.Design/methodology/approach942 Jewish participants in Israel responded to an anonymous online questionnaire regarding a scenario addressing the possible employments of two male applicants: a homosexual and an ultra-Orthodox Jew. A variety of statistical tools, including regression analysis were performed to test hypotheses.FindingsFindings show that social dominance orientation, conservatism, gender and religiosity as well as frequency of contact with the “unlike other” impacted on hiring intention of the participants. These relationships varied in strength and direction with regard to the two applicant types in question.Practical implicationsThe explication of the phenomenon in question has both important theoretical and practical importance in a world where – concurrently – there exists increasing contact among individuals from different backgrounds and (perhaps not coincidently) increased signs of wariness of and discrimination toward those unlike ourselves. In light of economic costs related to discrimination – not to mention the personal costs to those discriminated against – organizations must better understand the dynamics of the phenomenon in question.Originality/valueThis is one of the first empirical examinations of the relative impact of personal and situational factors on hiring bias. In addition, it is the first study of its kind in Israel focusing on the mechanisms behind hiring bias toward gay males and ultra-orthodox males.

T1  - Does the term matter? The labeling effect on the perception of ethnic minorities: The case of The Romani in Serbia
AN  - 2621589282
AB  - Empirical research on the impact of linguistic labels on social perceptions is scarce, especially in the context of ethnic groups. Across three studies (N = 1185), we investigated the impact of labels on perceptions of the Romani ethnic group by non-Romani participants in Serbia. In Study 1 (N = 244), we found some evidence that the Romani elicit more positive perceptions (more sociable and competent) when labeled with the neutral (vs. derogatory) term. In two follow-up studies, we focused on investigating potential mechanisms. In Study 2, we tested whether positive perceptions emerged via perceived higher status, while in Study 3 we focused on the motivation to respond without prejudice and sensitivity to hate speech. Study 2 (N = 467) replicated the labeling effect showing that Romani were perceived more positively (more sociable and moral) when labeled with the neutral term. However, we found no support for perceived group status as a mechanism. Study 3 (N = 474) did not corroborate the labeling effect but found the higher external motivation to respond without prejudice (potential mechanism). Meta-analytic effects showed that Romani were perceived as more moral, sociable, and competent when the neutral term was used. These effects were to some extent moderated by ideology as they existed only for right-wing individuals. We conclude that the effect is much smaller than the effects in previous comparable studies.

T1  - COVID-19 and the temporary transformation of the UK social security system
AN  - 2581716553
AB  - This commentary discusses the implications of the changes made to the social security system by the UK government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Until the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government did not veer from its programme of welfare reform. However, emergency legislation made significant concessions including: an increase in the value of the UK’s main means-tested benefit Universal Credit, more favourable eligibility rules for the self-employed, a reduced conditionality regime, and an increase in the level of housing support.This paper argues that although the UK government’s COVID-19 social security response was necessary, it did not go far enough. A temporary lifting of some prejudicial elements of the social security system was welcome but this still leaves an overly complex system characterised by unacceptable delays in payment, inadequate support for many vulnerable groups, and inconsistent experiences for recipients of different benefits.

TY  - JOUR
T1  - Silencing by Not Telling: Testimonial Void as a New Kind of Testimonial Injustice
AN  - 2580196552
AB  - In this paper, I characterize a new kind of testimonial injustice (TI), a phenomenon I call ‘testimonial void’ (TV), which involves a substantial extension of the limits of the original concept put forward by Miranda Fricker. TV occurs when a speaker withholds epistemic materials on the basis of an epistemically and ethically faulty assumption that a hearer-to-be lacks the capacity to do anything epistemically relevant with them. As in testimonial smothering (TS), testimony is not proffered owing to an anticipated failure of uptake. However, unlike in cases of TS, the anticipated failure of uptake in TV is due to prejudice on the speaker’s part. By comparing TV with other forms of TI, I show that TV shares TI’s conceptual structure and harms. I argue that TV: a) shows the speaker to be a potential wrongdoer, b) reveals that TI cannot be equated with biased credibility assessments, c) entails both an indirect yet extreme form of silencing and d) the failure to extend a kind of epistemic trust implied by the enjoyment of epistemic relational equality. In addition, I explore intricate cases in which TV interacts with TS, identifying smothered instances of TV, as well as non-culpable cases of TV.

T1  - Living as immigrant in Germany: an analysis of civil society organizations leaders’ perspectives
AN  - 2600768877
AB  - PurposeImmigration is considered a stressful process that causes many problems such as social isolation, prejudice, unemployment, minority status and intergenerational tensions. This study aims to determine the opinions of the leaders of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Germany about the experiences of individuals who immigrated from Turkey to Germany.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, a qualitative method was used. This study was conducted between April and May 2014 with leaders of CSOs who were living in Germany. Informed consent forms were signed by all the participants. Purposeful sampling was used to select the leaders of CSOs to be included in the sample. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview format. The data reached saturation for the 30 leaders of CSOs. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and evaluated through thematic analysis.FindingsFour main themes were identified: “Difficulties experienced”, “Recommendations to cope with/solve the difficulties experienced,” “Medical tourism” and “Use of health services.”Research limitations/implicationsThis study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration during the interpretation of the results. A majority of the leaders of CSOs had bachelor’s degrees, and were middle-aged and older, which might affect the variety required in qualitative studies. Thus, it remains unclear whether the results could be generalized to all Turkish immigrants in Germany.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first qualitative study conducted with different Turkish CSO leaders living in Germany. This study outlines perspectives of CSO leaders’ migration-related challenges that Turkish immigrants struggle with to integrate into German societies. As a consequence, Turkish immigrants’ socio-cultural values, beliefs, difficulties they experienced, and legal rights should be taken into consideration in health care and tourism interactions. Possible found experiences could help to provide evidence on how to improve migrants’ situations.

T1  - DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE AND PERCEPTIONS OF RACISM
AN  - 2597482176
AB  - Various research has demonstrated that rapid racial demographic change may aid in triggering various forms of backlash under certain conditions. This has led scholars to speak of Whites “defending” their local environment in the face of eroding racial dominance. However, little research has addressed how perceptions of racism among minorities may be triggered under conditions of demographic change. This study attempts to fill this gap in the literature by examining the relationship between racial demographic change for Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians and perceptions of racial problems among these groups in the United States. Using standard OLS regressions, ordered logistic regressions, multinomial logistic regressions, and techniques accounting for selection into treatment, I find that Blacks and Hispanics living in counties undergoing rapid growth of Black and Hispanic populations, respectively, have higher perceptions of racial problems. Asians show no evidence of increased perceptions of racial problems in counties undergoing rapid Asian growth. For Blacks, this relationship is concentrated among those without at least a four-year degree and residents of counties with lower initial White populations (and higher initial Black populations). For Hispanics, it is similarly concentrated among those without at least a four-year degree, but also is likely stronger among residents of counties with higher initial White populations (and lower initial Hispanic populations), highlighting unique racial dynamics. This research adds to a growing body of work showing the importance of examining demographic change at the local level in order to understand some of today’s most pressing political and social issues.

T1  - The Legacy of Allende’s Revolutionary Cultural Politics, 1970–73
AN  - 2585941885
AB  - During Allende's revolutionary socialism (1970-73), Chile experienced a subversive moment that overturned some of the hierarchical divisions of society and harnessed the creative capacities of those who had been marginalized from artistic and creative labor. The supporters of the socialist government--workers, students, activists, artists, and intellectuals--dared to redefine the hierarchical bounds by envisioning a different world. Cultural workers realized that the existing dominant culture and educational system was adverse to socialism, and they spearheaded a new political culture in which critical thinking was a focal point to incite political activism. The architects and organizers of this new political culture, although a heterogeneous group with different perspectives of thought and practice, shared two important points of confluence: They were critical of the existing order of oppression, and they were agents of change. They argued that the ruling ideology, the educational system, and the mainstream national identity tended to reinforce upper-class prejudices and cultural discrimination against the interests of the popular classes, the classes "of the people."

T1  - Evaluations of LGBT job applicants: consequences of applying “out”
TT  - Evaluations of LGBT job applicants
AN  - 2583778165
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to experimentally investigate whether disclosing one's sexual orientation while applying for a job would impact hiring decisions.Design/methodology/approachThe experiment employed a 2 (Applicant Gender: Male/Female) × 2 (Applicant Sexual Orientation: Heterosexual or Gay/Lesbian) × 2 (Job Type: Masculine/Feminine) between-subjects design. Participants (N = 349) were randomly assigned to one of eight applicant conditions. They were first presented with a job description, followed by a cover letter displaying the applicants' qualifications, gender and sexual orientation. Participants evaluated the applicant's competence, social skills and hireability, and provided self-reports of their attitudes toward gays/lesbians and traditional gender roles.FindingsThe results demonstrated a distinct pattern of discrimination toward gay/lesbian applicants who were rated significantly lower in competence, social skills and hireability than were heterosexual applicants. Additionally, using multigroup structural equation modeling, we found that sexual orientation differentially impacted the relationship between attitudes and hireability ratings; negative attitudes toward homosexuality, beliefs about sexual orientation as a choice and belief in traditional gender roles were significant predictors of hireability ratings for gay/lesbian applicants, but were unrelated to evaluations of heterosexual applicants.Research limitations/implicationsThe current study highlights the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination against Lesbian Gay Bisexual Trans (LGBT) workers including lower evaluations of competence, social skills and structural differences in the impact of attitudes. These direct links must be explicitly addressed for continued progress related to equality, diversity and inclusion in Human Resource Management (HRM). Continued multidisciplinary research that considers gender identity and sexual orientation signal salience, consequences of specific career stereotypes, regional differences and the effects of societal shifts in attitudes overtime will continue to improve our understanding and drive us toward a more equitable future.Practical implicationsBy identifying the underlying mechanisms involved in hiring discrimination, this study highlights the need for diversity trainings that go beyond the blanket approaches to diversity management and explicitly address conscious and unconscious biases that may influence the hiring process. Additionally, it is critical for organizations to provide top-down support from leadership, and implement mechanisms that allow LGBT voices to be heard and feel comfortable in their work environment to reduce the psychological strain.Social implicationsPrior to the recent landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on June 15, 2020, which extended the 1964 Civil Rights Act workplace protections to gay, lesbianand transgender employees, in many places across the United States Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) identifying workers could still be legally discriminated against. The pattern of discrimination identified in the current study provides clear evidence that these protections are necessary, and long overdue.Originality/valueThis study identifies two clear patterns of hiring discrimination: (1) lower hireability ratings and (2) structural differences in the evaluative process for gay/lesbian applicants. These findings provide experimental evidence, currently lacking in the literature, that support survey-based and qualitative findings of LGBT's experiences, and demonstrate how negative attitudes, irrelevant to the qualifications of an applicant, seep into hiring decisions.

T1  - Silencing inconvenient memories: refugees from Asia Minor in Greek historiography
AN  - 2582906066
AB  - This paper explores the link between memory and history ‘from below’ as well as the (non-) use of histories of past migration in Greece. It analyses how the memory of the 1920s Asia Minor refugees was guarded by Greek state over the course of time. It explores how state agents (historiography, education system, commemorations, etc.) acted as guardians of collective memory ‘from above’, presenting a rosy past that ignored the experiences of these refugees in Greece. It also examines how this process of constructing historical memory ‘from above’ (re)produced national belonging through homogeneity, without taking notice of refugees’ diversities or problems faced during their settlement in the social, cultural or economic space of Greece. The paper adopts a critical approach to the cultural and social spaces in which refugee memory was selectively constructed as the only past that has to be remembered, stored and recalled, and aims to rescue from oblivion memories that were condemned to silence in the contemporary national narrative. These silenced memories could help us to write a history ‘from below’ and find analogies with the experiences of contemporary refugee flows as well as to combat ever-present xenophobia, prejudice and racism in the present society.

T1  - The Islamophobia Index: Exploring the Challenges in Establishing Reliability for a Content Analysis Instrument Evaluating Islamophobia in Media Texts
AN  - 2581891779
AB  - In a wide variety of studies over the past two decades, the media has consistently been identified as a significant social institution implicated in normalizing and disseminating anti-Muslim prejudice. Identifying and combating Islamophobic discourses has been a challenging proposition, however, due to difficulties in systematically identifying and evaluating Islamophobia within texts. Islamophobia is a complex and contested phenomenon that defies easy classification within the boundaries of terminology which would normally be employed to describe hostility or prejudice based on, for example, race or religion. This article outlines some of the challenges involved in defining and categorizing Islamophobic discourses through an exploration of the process of constructing, evaluating, and applying a unique content analysis instrument, the Islamophobia Index, to media texts, using data sets drawn from the Australian news media. We critically reflect upon the methodological limitations of systematic quantitative studies, the importance of qualitative and interpretive approaches that take into account researcher subjectivities, and ultimately reposition and repurpose this project as a mixed-method study. In conclusion, potential applications for the Index, including non-media textual analysis, are considered.

T1  - After Luther: Visual Culture, Materiality and the Legacy of 1517
AN  - 2580642711
AB  - Do historians look at Luther and the Lutheran Reformation differently in the aftermath of the Lutherjahr of 2017, and its frenzy of academic and public activity? As recent publications on Luther demonstrate – notably Lyndal Roper's 2016 biography Martin Luther: renegade and prophet – there is a still a great deal to say about Luther, and how his friendships, passions, prejudices and physical experiences shaped him. But while Luther was the monumental public figure of 2017, some of the most important work coinciding with the anniversary addressed instead Lutheranism as a movement, and the nature of religious identities in Luther's aftermath. It also demonstrated and furthered the impact of the visual and material turn in history and in Reformation studies. Building upon decades of scholarship on Lutheran visual images, recent Reformation scholarship has demonstrated in increasing depth how religious identity can and should be read through both material and visual culture. The three publications examined here – a monograph by Bridget Heal, a website by Brian Cummings, Ceri Law, Bronwyn Wallace and Alexandra Walsham, and the exhibition catalogue Luther! 95 treasures – 95 people – contribute to the material, sensory turn in Reformation and early modern scholarship, and in the latter two cases also reveal the impact of this upon public engagement with Reformation histories.

T1  - Gender-biased office culture in Croatian PR industry: why feminine sectors practice masculine patterns?
TT  - Gender-biased office culture
AN  - 2577606713
AB  - PurposeThis paper aimed to research attitudes of women working in the Croatian public relations (PR) industry regarding office culture (networking, banter, dress codes, etc.).Design/methodology/approachThis paper uses Bourdieu's habitus theory and analyses the experiences of women working in the Croatian PR industry with a focus on office culture. The study is based on 21 in-depth interviews with women working in the Croatian PR industry. Thematic analysis has been used to analyse data.FindingsAlthough female employees (76.84%) dominate the PR industry in Croatia, the so-called masculine patterns still prevail in the PR sector. Results show that women are often exposed to gender discrimination but at the same time, they also perpetuate gender-based prejudices.Practical implicationsEmployees in the PR industry should consider working on their own gender stereotypes that impact their patterns of behaviour. Relinquishment of the ideas of patriarchal essentialism would consequently change career progression opportunities, and it would particularly improve networking among women, which could lead to career advancement opportunities.Social implicationsStructural changes are needed in society to avoid women perpetuating inequality through masculine behaviour and unrealistic expectations that many women cannot meet.OriginalityTo the best of the author's knowledge, this paper is the first paper that explores gender-biased office culture in the Croatian PR industry. In doing so, the paper also applies Bourdieu's habitus theory, thus contributing to studying cultural masculinities from a Croatian perspective. The paper also introduces the concept of gender-biased behaviour.

T1  - Are Non-U.S. Citizens Color-Blind? The Racialization of Violent Crimes
AN  - 2562783433
AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether U.S. citizenship status influences the racialization of offenders engaged in homicide, sexual violence, and terrorism. The role of social media exposure and interracial contact are explored as additional proximal factors that may explain racialization across citizenship status. The cross-sectional online survey consisted of 729 participants enrolled at a culturally diverse northeastern university. Results suggest that non-U.S. citizens have a more color-blind perspective and are less likely to racialize crime when associating a particular race/ethnicity with violent crimes. Surprisingly, social media exposure and interracial contact were not significant contributors to racialization. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are discussed.

T1  - Detecting changes between two strangers: Insight from a classic change blindness paradigm: GPIR
AN  - 2573357334
AB  - The current study aims to investigate what factors influence whether adults detect a change between social partners in a brief interaction. In two experiments, we examined whether locale diversity, a stranger’s marginalized minority status (e.g., minority race, minority religious affiliation), and race congruence (e.g., own or other race) influenced the likelihood of being differentiated. Using a change blindness paradigm, an experimenter approached pedestrians asking for directions, then surreptitiously changed places with a confederate. After the switch, we measured whether pedestrians noticed if the person had changed. In Experiment 1, noticing rates were significantly lower for confederates belonging to a minority race compared to White confederates, but only in the more homogenous location and not in the highly diverse location. In Experiment 2, pedestrians were least likely to detect a change when confederates belonged to a religious minority and a racial minority. We discuss the important implications for prejudicial behaviour and eyewitness identification, as well as the utility of performing psychological research outside of the lab.

TT  - Indexicality, language gentrification, and social inequality in the standardization of Galician
AN  - 2572379741
AB  - The aim of this paper is to show the relationship between indexicality, standardization policy and socioeconomic inequalities in the Galician linguistic field (as a minor language of Spain). I will examine the discursive role of Galician elites in the building of indexical orders from the Renaissance movement (19th century) onwards, and its links to the current negative representations of rural Galician. Also, I will explore the relationship between anti-rural prejudices, ideologies of class and standard ideologies, showing how common speakers share the stigmatizing indexical values of the elites, and rural speakers consent to the symbolic violence of which they are victims. Finally, I adapt the concept of gentrification from contemporary urbanism to the linguistic field in order to explain the impact of elitist academic lingualizing discourse on traditional speakers of Galician and also on the value of their varieties in the linguistic market. I support my analysis on the metalinguistic discourse of members of the intellectual elites authorized in the Galician linguistic and cultural field from Renaissance to contemporaneity, attitudinal matched-guise research, and ethnographic studies of the second millennium.

T1  - Why Can’t You Just Pick One? The Stigmatization of Non-binary/Genderqueer People by Cis and Trans Men and Women: An Empirical Test of Norm-Centered Stigma Theory
AN  - 2569488813
AB  - Non-binary and genderqueer identities often resonate with people whose genders are outside the man-woman dichotomy, fluid, androgynous, and/or variant. Yet the gender binary system remains the unwavering norm, often placing non-binary and genderqueer people on the margins of social acceptability, and surprisingly little research has investigated those who stigmatize non-binary/genderqueer people. The current study utilizes Worthen’s (2020) Norm-Centered Stigma Theory (NCST) and nationally representative data collected from U.S. online panelists (n = 3009: 1419 cis men, 1461 cis women, 74 trans women, 55 trans men) to investigate how norms (cisnormativity) and gender identity axes of social power (man/woman, cis/trans, and intersecting cis/trans-man/woman identities) relate to the stigmatization of non-binary/genderqueer people. Overall findings indicate that (a) cisnormativity is integral to understanding non-binary/genderqueer stigma, (b) the stigmatizer’s gender identity axes of social power are essential to explore as related to both cisnormativity and non-binary/genderqueer stigma, and (c) cisgender women are significantly different from others when it comes to both cisnormativity and non-binary/genderqueer stigma. Overall, the results underscore the significance of focusing on the unique complexities involved in the stigmatization of non-binary/genderqueer people and work toward dismantling such negativities.

T1  - The Legacies of Tennis Champions Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe, and the Williams Sisters Show the Persistence of America’s Race Obstacles
AN  - 2565277886
AB  - Black athletes have had to express a double consciousness of being American and being Black. By exploring the biographies of pioneering tennis figures—Althea Gibson, Arthur Ashe, and the Williams sisters—Venus and Serena—one can look at their encounters with racism and their quests for self-respect and explore the social implications of race in the USA. To understand race and its complications on the world in which black tennis players navigate, we broadly look at racial discrimination in their lives using the lens of sociological concepts such as “the color line” hypersegregation and “American Apartheid;” the controlling image thesis and respectability politics, and class mobility in and outside the black community. The concepts connect to illuminate the racial constructs and structures the players operated in and which shaped in the process of becoming a sports champion. Through their biographies, we argue that it is possible to interrogate the ways in which America’s longstanding racial policies, prejudices, and perspectives have had a persistent impact on not only the lives of black tennis players, but the lives of black Americans.

T1  - Controlled experiments: ethnographic notes on the intergenerational dynamics of aspirational migration and agrarian change in upland Laos
AN  - 2576801653
AB  - This article provides ethnographic insights into the Southeast Asian peasantry’s engagements with agrarian change. It speaks both to Southeast Asian studies’ longstanding interest in the dynamics of socio‐economic transformation, and to anthropology’s burgeoning focus on how future‐oriented aspirations are produced, negotiated and enacted under specific socio‐political, material and historical conditions. Drawing on 12 months of ethnographic fieldwork in an ethnic Khmu hamlet in northern Laos, I show upland peasants on the cusp of agrarian transition engaging aspirational migration through ‘controlled experiments’: pioneering pursuits of betterment, crucially buttressed by multiple, locally specific factors. These factors include a still largely intact peasant natural economy, historically endowed intimacy with the modernising state and, not least, a precariously persistent ‘intergenerational contract’ in which youthful mobility and parental stability remain ambiguously yet irreducibly intertwined. Notably, whereas much research on Laos has focused on communities (adversely) impacted by transition, this article discusses a community that is both politically connected and, concomitantly, still relatively unscathed by the (transitory) detriments of commodification, enclosure and dispossession. In sum, this article confirms that while striving for a better future is probably a basic aspect of the human condition, definitions and pursuits of such futures are contextually contingent, not least along generational lines.Alternate abstract:Expériences contrôlées: migration intergénérationnelle dans les hauts plateaux du Laos – notes sur les aspirations et le changement agraireCet article donne un aperçu ethnographique de l’engagement de la paysannerie d’Asie du Sud‐Est dans le changement agraire. Il s’inscrit dans le cadre de l’intérêt de longue date des études sur l’Asie du Sud‐Est pour la dynamique de la transformation socioéconomique et de l’intérêt croissant de l’anthropologie pour la manière dont les aspirations orientées vers l’avenir sont produites, négociées et mises en oeuvre dans des conditions sociopolitiques, matérielles et historiques spécifiques. S’appuyant sur douze mois de travail sur le terrain dans un hameau de l’ethnie Khmu au nord du Laos, l’essai montre que les paysans des hautes terres, à l’aube de la transition agraire, s’engagent dans une migration aspirationnelle par le biais « d’expériences contrôlées » : des recherches pionnières d’amélioration, façonnées de manière cruciale par de multiples facteurs locaux spécifiques. Ces facteurs comprennent une économie naturelle paysanne encore largement intacte, une intimité historique avec l’État en cours de modernisation et, surtout, un « contrat intergénérationnel » persistant et précaire. Dans ce cadre, la mobilité des jeunes et la stabilité parentale restent ambiguës mais irréductiblement liées. Notamment, alors que de nombreuses études sur le Laos se concentrent sur les communautés défavorablement marginalisées par la transition, je révèle une situation contraire – une communauté qui est à la fois politiquement liée et, simultanément, encore relativement indemne des prejudices (transitoires) de la marchandisation, de l’enfermement et de la dépossession. En bref, l’article confirme que si la recherche d’un meilleur avenir est cruciale pour la condition humaine, les définitions et la poursuite d’un tel avenir dépendent du contexte, notamment des générations.

T1  - Vaccine hesitancy, state bias, and Covid-19: Evidence from a survey experiment using Phase-3 results announcement by BioNTech and Pfizer
AN  - 2561105239
AB  - Background: Past survey studies document that people strongly prefer Covid-19 vaccines developed domestically over those developed abroad. Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. Methods: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. Results: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prejudice against foreign countries may be less of a concern for vaccine hesitancy and that its effect may be highly context specific.

T1  - Open grazing prohibitions and the politics of exclusivist identity in Nigeria
AN  - 2553634751
AB  - This article critically examines the politics of socio-political exclusions, with particular reference to the recurrent surges of herdsmen/farmers’ skirmishes that are currently ravaging many states in Nigeria. Owing to their occupation and prejudiced history, the Fulani herdsmen have not enjoyed full assimilation into mainstream cohesion, and the enactment of laws proscribing ‘open grazing’ by some states, in a bid to protect farmers and farmlands, appears to have further entrenched this supposed exclusion. Consequently, the group, through its Miyetti Allah Cattle Associations, has urged state governments to refrain from enforcing these laws. The implementation of the laws by Benue and Taraba States has caused herdsmen to react angrily by killing hundreds of people in the states. To what extent are these states justified in prohibiting open grazing? Can a group justifiably warn a sovereign, federating, state against implementing a law duly passed by its State Assembly? Using critical analysis, the paper proffers answers to these questions by drawing insights from philosophical arguments of social justice, particularly Nozickian justice as entitlement. Given that what is at stake is the economic livelihoods of both farmers and cattle herders, the paper also provides an objective analysis of the conflict by pointing out the central claims of both parties in the dispute. It concludes that solution to these skirmishes inheres in an approach that emphasizes social justice and inclusion.

T1  - Shades of Homophobia: A Framework for Analyzing Negative Attitudes Toward Homosexuality
AN  - 2547794700
AB  - The term homophobia is widely used to describe negative attitudes toward homosexuality. As with some concepts in the social sciences, different researchers apply the term to widely different forms of discrimination against gay men and lesbians. Existing research provides some general classifications of different spheres in which homophobia operate, but these typologies are too broad to serve as frameworks for in-depth analyses of discourses and manifestations of homophobia. This article reviews different conceptualizations associated with the term homophobia in academic literature and synthesizes these diverse positions into a comprehensive framework—a taxonomy of homophobia—that can facilitate analysis of homophobia in a given context and enhance comparisons between contexts. The proposed homophobia framework postulates that negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians can manifest in seven distinct, yet interrelated shades, namely radical, prohibitionist, denialist, avoidance, morbidity, tepid, and veiled.

AB  - This special issue of the International Social Security Review addresses the important topic of social protection for digital platform workers in Europe. The special issue highlights the risk that social protection systems may be largely undermined by a decline in social solidarity in favour of individualism, the partial or full privatization of social security, and a reduction in protection levels, all as a result of the emergence of digital platforms and the support they receive from legislators in most countries.Alternate abstract:Ce numéro spécial de l’International Social Security Review est consacré à un sujet important: celui de la protection sociale des travailleurs des plateformes en Europe. Il met en lumière le risque que les systèmes de protection sociale soient fortement fragilisés par un recul de la solidarité sociale au profit de l’individualisme, par la privatisation partielle ou totale de la sécurité sociale et par une diminution des niveaux de protection sociale; autant de phénomènes qui sont eux‐mêmes la résultante de l’apparition des plateformes numériques et du soutien dont elles bénéficient de la part du législateur dans la plupart des pays.Alternate abstract:En este número especial de la revista International Social Security Review se aborda la importante cuestión de la protección social de los trabajadores de las plataformas digitales en Europa. En él se pone de relieve el riesgo de que los sistemas de protección puedan estar debilitándose considerablemente debido a la disminución de la solidaridad social en favor del individualismo, la privatización total o parcial de la seguridad social y la reducción de los niveles de protección, como consecuencia de la aparición de las plataformas digitales y el apoyo que reciben de los legisladores en la mayor parte de los países.Alternate abstract:Diese Sondernummer der International Social Security Review befasst sich mit dem wichtigen Thema des Sozialschutzes für Beschäftigte digitaler Plattformen in Europa. In der aktuellen Ausgabe wird das Risiko beschrieben, dass die Sozialschutzsysteme durch das Auftauchen digitaler Plattformen und durch die Unterstützung, die diese von den Gesetzgebern der meisten Länder erhalten, ausgehöhlt werden könnten. Grund dafür sind der verbreitete Individualismus, die partielle oder vollständige Privatisierung der sozialen Sicherheit und die gesunkenen Schutzniveaus, die allesamt Zeichen einer abnehmenden gesellschaftlichen Solidarität sind.Alternate abstract:В специальном выпуске обозрения International Social Security Review рассматривается важная тема – социальная защита работников цифровых платформ в Европе.

T1  - CAN WE HAVE TRUST IN HOST GOVERNMENT? SELF-ESTEEM, WORK ATTITUDES AND PREJUDICE OF LOW-STATUS EXPATRIATES LIVING IN CHINA
AN  - 2581018966
AB  - The paper aims to investigate whether trust in a host government can mitigate the negative effects caused by the social complexities facing low-status expatriates (LSEs) living in China. It models trust in host government as a mediator in the relationship between expatriates' perception of status-based prejudice and their work attitudes; it further outlines the role of self-esteem in this relationship. The study seeks to expand knowledge in the domain of expatriate management by explaining the prejudicial behavior of host country towards low-status expatriates. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze responses from LSEs in China. The results provide the evidence that perceived discrimination negatively affects expatriates' work attitudes and suggest that trust in the host government can mediate such effects. Self-esteem is found to be a significant moderator in the relationship. With this, the study empirically affirms social categorization theory, showing it to be a powerful lens through which LSE adaptability can be the behavior of host nationals towards low-status expatriates and can be further developed with regard to the adaptability of low-status expatriates.

T1  - Slovak Version of Internal and External Motivation to Respond without Prejudice Scale
AN  - 2578203510
AB  - Internal and external motivation to respond without prejudice scale (IEMS) provides a self-report tool sensitive to individual tendencies to control implicit and explicit prejudice without directly inquiring about attitudes toward an outgroup. The current study verified the scale's psychometric properties and construct validity on a Slovak sample. In line with the predictions, the principal component analysis suggested, and confirmatory factor analysis validated the presence of two uncorrelated factors of internal and external motivation. Additionally, while internal motivation was positively associated with adherence to egalitarianism and negatively with authoritarianism, external motivation did not demonstrate any of these relationships. Furthermore, only external motivation was found to be positively related to expressive self-control that parallels propositions claiming greater self-regulatory demands when egalitarian norms are followed to avoid social disapproval. Finally, both factors were positively correlated with concerns from appearing prejudiced, although internal motivation in a significantly greater degree, reflecting larger dependency on self-oriented concerns. With appropriate values of internal consistency for both factors, the IEMS scale provides a reliable self-report measure that might be used for systematic control of individual differences in the research of social cognition in intergroup context.

T1  - Conversations About Opioids: Impact of the Opioid Overdose Epidemic on Social Interactions for People Who Live With Chronic Pain
AN  - 2572166597
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the opioid overdose epidemic on the social lives of people suffering from chronic pain, focusing on interactions within their personal and professional circles. The study was based on 22 in-depth interviews with people living with chronic pain in Canada. Using thematic analysis, we documented three main impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic: (a) increased worries of people in pain and their families regarding the dangers of opioids; (b) prejudices, stigma, and discrimination faced during conversations about opioids; and (c) stigma management attempts, which include self-advocacy and concealment of opioid use. This study represents important knowledge advancement on how people manage stigma and communicate about chronic disease during everyday life interactions. By showing negative effects of the epidemic’s media coverage on the social experiences of people with chronic pain, we underscore needs for destigmatizing approaches in public communication regarding opioids.

T1  - Where Is the Fairness in Canadian Cannabis Legalization? Lessons to be Learned from the American Experience
AN  - 2561723853
AB  - Canada has received praise and international attention for its departure from strict cannabis prohibition and the introduction of a legal regulatory framework for adult use. In addition to the perceived public health and public safety benefits associated with legalization, reducing the burden placed on the individuals criminalized for cannabis use served as an impetus for change. In comparison to many jurisdictions in the United States, however, Canadian legalization efforts have done less to address the harms that drug law enforcement has inflicted on individuals and communities. This article documents the racialized nature of drug prohibition in Canada and the US and compares the stated aims of legalization in in both jurisdictions. The article outlines the various reparative measures being proposed and implemented in America and contrasts those with the situation in Canada, arguing, furthermore that the absence of social justice measures in Canadian legalization is an extension of the systemic racism perpetuated under prohibition.Alternate abstract:
Le Canada a reçu des éloges et attiré l’attention du monde entier pour avoir renoncé à l’interdiction stricte du cannabis et introduit un cadre de réglementation juridique visant la consommation chez l’adulte. Si les avantages en matière de santé et de sécurité publiques associés à la légalisation sont évidents, le désir de réduire le fardeau imposé aux personnes criminalisées pour consommation de cannabis a lui aussi poussé au changement. Le Canada s’est cependant montré moins efficace sur le plan législatif que de nombreux États américains pour remédier aux préjudices infligés aux particuliers et aux collectivités par l’application de la loi sur les stupéfiants. Cet article montre le caractère racialisé de l’interdiction des stupéfiants au Canada et aux États-Unis et compare les objectifs déclarés de la légalisation dans les deux pays. Il décrit les diverses mesures de réparation proposées et mises en œuvre aux États-Unis et les compare à la situation au Canada. Il soutient en outre que l’absence de mesures de justice sociale dans la légalisation canadienne constitue une extension du racisme systémique qui avait cours à l’époque de l’interdiction.

T1  - Three clusters of content-audience associations in expression of racial prejudice while consuming online television news
AN  - 2554597182
AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an “online television” service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns.

T1  - Black British female managers—The silent catastrophe
AN  - 2552827194
AB  - The researcher examined the experiences of Black British female managers (BBFM) who worked for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) operating in the UK. The following research questions guided this study: How do Black British female managers experience racial microaggressions and how do they cope with it? Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 10 BBFM who worked for CYPS and who had similar demographic characteristics (i.e., racial/ethnic background and managerial experience). Interview transcripts were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006a). Over 200 codes were identified and extracted from individual interview transcripts. Organizing the codes into categories resulted in five themes that highlighted the challenging practices that BBFM perceived thwarted their careers (i.e., The Organizational Culture, On the Outside Looking In, Stereotype Threat, Prejudice, and Discrimination and Institutional Racism and Espoused Practice vs. Reality), and one theme that described their coping strategies (i.e., The Silent Catastrophe). Although the study is centered on a multisectorial sample, two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, gendered racism curtails the career development of BBFM in ways that are not experienced by their White counterparts. Second, BBFM perceive that their experiences in CYPS was fundamentally negatively disproportionate and aversive. The implication is that CYPS leaders must give racial and gender equality, diversity and inclusion greater priority.

TT  - Jean Rhys'ın Geniş Geniş Bir Deniz ve E. M. Forster'ın Meleklerin Uǧramadıǧı Yer Romanlarında Çokkültürlülük
AN  - 2579142894
AB  - Bu makalenin amacı, Jean Rhys'ın Geniş Geniş Bir Deniz ve E. M. Forster'ın Meleklerin Uǧramadıǧı Yer romanlarında, karakterlerin yaşam tarzları, dil, milletler arası evlenme, özgürlüǧün idaresi, kültürel uygulamalar baǧlamında, çokkültürlülüǧün, Büyük ve Küçük Antiller ve İngiltere'de, yirminci yüz yılın karmaşasında nasıl ele alındıǧını, karşılaştırmaktır. Çokkültürlü toplumlarda, Forster humanist bakış açısını sorgulayarak ikili zıtlıkları açıklamakta, Rhys ise kölelik sonrası dönemdeki deǧişimden kaynaklanan yıkıma odaklanmaktadır. Her iki romanda da karakterlerin önyargıları, deǧerleri; sosyal entegrasyon olan milletlerarası evlilik ve göçe karşıt oluşturur. Kültürel çeşitliliǧi olan toplumlar, yirminci yüzyılda azınlıkları kendi kültürlerine entegre etmek için baskın kültürün zorlayıcı uygulamalarına maruz kalırlar. Bu makale şemsiye terim çokkültürlülüǧün altında, önyargının ve kültürel entegrasyonun reddini her iki romanda inceler.Alternate abstract:The aim of this article is to compare and contrast how multiculturalism is handled in Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea and E. M. Forster's Where Angels Fear to Tread regarding the lifestyles of the characters, language, intermarriage, management of freedom, the cultural practices in the West Indies, and Monteriano Italy, within the tumultuous time of the twentieth century. In multicultural societies, Forster elucidates cross-binaries questing humanistic views whereas Rhys focuses on subversion of the post-slavery era. In both novels, the characters' prejudices, values run counter to the practices of social integration such as intermarriages, immigration. The culturally diverse societies undergo the dominant culture's enforced practices to integrate minorities into their own culture in the twentieth century. Thus, this article explores the denial of prejudice, the denial of cultural integration under the umbrella term multiculturalism in these two novels.

T1  - Hate crime and racial discrimination in Ecuador: The case of Michael Arce in ESMIL
AN  - 2533165022
AB  - For the first time in Ecuador a hate crime was tried in court and led to a conviction. This was the case of Michael Arce, a young Afro-Ecuadorian former cadet who won the trial against Captain Fernando Encalada of the Eloy Alfaro Military School (ESMIL). ESMIL belongs to the Ecuadorian Armed Forces, a state institution considered to be of great prestige and a guarantor of citizens’ rights and democracy, but not for all. Arce suffered in ESMIL 2 months of humiliation and torture. Through a socio-legal analysis this article demonstrates the normalization of racial stereotypes and prejudices, and the sometimes subtle existence of structural and institutional racism in the education and judicial systems. This case represents a pioneering judicial action in Ecuador that legally established and defined new pretrial and trial proceedings in regard to litigation concerning violation of human rights, racial discrimination and hate crimes.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - Structural Equation Model Predicting LGB Ally Behaviors in Heterosexuals
AN  - 2513076456
AB  - IntroductionWhile numerous studies have focused on heterosexuals’ attitudes toward lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals, few studies have examined ally behaviors and their predictors. The present study aimed to model the connections between LGB interpersonal contact and heterosexism in relation to ally behaviors among heterosexuals.MethodsHeterosexual adults (n = 333) completed an online survey assessing interpersonal contact with LGB individuals, heterosexism, and ally behaviors.ResultsA good-fitting structural equation model showed significant direct effects (all ps < 0.001) from LGB contact to heterosexism (β = − 450), from heterosexism to ally behaviors (β = − 0.280), and from LGB contact to ally behaviors (β = 0.594). There was a significant indirect (mediational) effect from LGB contact to ally behaviors through heterosexism (β = 0.126, p = .001).ConclusionThe results inform targets for interventions with heterosexuals, such as the facilitation of interpersonal contact between LGB and heterosexuals to reduce prejudice and increase ally behaviors.

T1  - Ideology and the stigma of schizophrenia: Applying the dual‐process motivational model in the French and Greek contexts
AN  - 2518085645
AB  - The authors have underlined the influence of issues of power and ideology on the stigma of schizophrenia. The dual‐process cognitive‐motivational model of ideology and prejudice has shown that for deviant and derogated groups, such as people with schizophrenia, both authoritarianism and social dominance orientation can predict prejudice. However, this model has not been tested in relation to the stigma of schizophrenia. In this paper, we apply the Dual Process Model to the study of stigmatizing attitudes, in two contexts where the model has not been tested before, France (N = 224), and Greece (N = 238). We tested the relation of the model's two pathways (dominance‐competitiveness and authoritarianism‐dangerousness) to stigmatizing attitudes, while making the hypothesis that both would be associated with the latter since people with schizophrenia are perceived as both derogate/subordinate and deviant/threatening. Our results show that the models adequately fit the data and partly confirm the pathways predicted by previous research. However, for the Greek sample, the dominance‐competitiveness component was not significantly associated with stigmatizing attitudes, suggesting that for this sample, people with schizophrenia are mainly stigmatized in terms of deviance/threat. Our results provide evidence for the DPM's application to the study of the stigma of schizophrenia in two contexts where the model has never been applied and underline the importance of ideological and socio‐cognitive factors for community interventions.

T1  - Exploring the Influence of Hookup Culture on Female and Male Rape Myths
AN  - 2516728896
AB  - The present study systematically assesses the influence of hookup culture endorsement on the acceptance of female rape myths (i.e., false, stereotypical, or prejudicial beliefs regarding sexual assault involving female survivors) and male rape myths (i.e., false, stereotypical, or prejudicial beliefs about sexual assault involving male survivors). Multivariate regression analyses were conducted to assess the primary hypotheses that a particular form of hookup culture endorsement (i.e., the belief that hookups elevate an individual’s social status) would act as the primary predictor of male and female rape myth acceptance among a sample of 376 U.S. college students. As with prior research, a complex relationship emerged for both male and female rape mythology in which acceptance increases or decreases based upon the form of hookup culture endorsement examined, as the endorsement of beliefs reflecting heterosexual power dynamics (e.g., harmlessness and status attainment) functioned as positive predictors of rape myth acceptance, while beliefs challenging such assumptions (e.g., sexual freedom) served to decrease rape myth acceptance. Results supported the primary hypotheses that beliefs concerning hookups and status attainment would be the largest predictor of male rape myth acceptance and female rape myth acceptance. Consistent with prior research, the predictive power of gender and religiosity was initially significant across both male and female rape myth acceptance yet diminished when controlling for levels of hookup culture endorsement. Furthermore, analyses indicated gender differences among the influences of hookup culture endorsement for female rape myth acceptance alone, as even though beliefs concerning status served as an aggravating factor for female rape myth acceptance, beliefs concerning sexual freedom served as a mitigating factor for women only.

T1  - Prosperous But Fearful of Falling: The Wealth Paradox, Collective Angst, and Opposition to Immigration
AN  - 2507923452
AB  - Building on growing evidence that relative economic gratification may be associated with prejudice toward minorities, such as immigrants, the question remains when and why prosperity and wealth may enhance opposition to immigration. In a correlational study (Study 1, N = 498), we show that increased fear of falling in the future (individually or collectively) is associated with greater opposition to immigration. We then experimentally studied the effects of potential (Study 2, N = 294) and actual (Study 3, N = 166) downward mobility among the relatively wealthy, as well as of relatively stagnating wealthy in the context where an initially poorer group is quickly gaining wealth over time (Study 4, N = 151). We find that fear of falling among the wealthy is associated with more opposition to immigration, mediated by collective angst. We conclude that the anticipation that the economic future looks less rosy than the present evokes collective angst, which, in turn, fuels prejudice toward immigrants.

T1  - Homophobia and national collective narcissism in populist Poland: European Journal of Sociology
AN  - 2598939609
AB  - Opposition to sexual minority rights in Poland is among the highest in the EU. Populist political actors in the country repeatedly scapegoat gays and lesbians, presenting them as a threat to the Polish nation and its shared norms and values, particularly those derived from religion. Building upon previous research which shows how discourse constructing homosexuality as a threat to the nation has been used by social and political actors to legitimize homophobic rhetoric and behaviour, our paper shows whether nationalism—understood here as national collective narcissism—predicts prejudice towards gays and lesbians at the level of individual beliefs.

T1  - Tolerance of racism: A new construct that predicts failure to recognize and confront racism
AN  - 2581010114
AB  - Often people who may not personally express racist beliefs nevertheless have a passive orientation to racism and tolerate racist statements and acts by others. We examine individual differences in willingness to accept racist views or acts in others, labelled tolerance of racism (TOR), in four online survey studies (total N = 2,008). We demonstrate that TOR is distinct from, although correlated with, established forms of bias, such as symbolic and modern racism and social dominance orientation, which measure bias toward marginalized groups rather than tolerance of people who express racism (typically members of dominant groups). Across studies, results indicate that Whites exhibited higher TOR than did people of color, although Black, Latinx, and other people of color still exhibit considerable TOR. Further, people high in TOR minimized the severity of racist acts and were less likely to confront them. They also expressed less concern about current events reflecting racial discrimination and hate and less support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which challenges societal racism. Thus, TOR reflects a passive orientation to racism that influences interpersonal behavior as well as views of macro‐level discrimination, leading to the perpetuation of racial inequality.

T1  - THE PUZZLE OF RACIAL INEQUALITY IN CUBA, 1980s–2010s
AN  - 2569557183
AB  - Contrasting perspectives on racism and racial inequality collide in contemporary Cuba. On the one hand, government officials argue that Cuba is a racially egalitarian country; though vestiges of historical racism subsist, systematic discrimination does not. On the other hand, social movement actors and organizations denounce that racism and discrimination are systemic and affect large sectors of the Afro-Cuban population. To draw these visions into scholarly dialogue, our analytic strategy consists in the comparative examination of both narratives as well as the empirical bases that sustain them. Using data from the 1981, 2002, and 2012 Cuban Censuses for the first time, as well as various non-census evidentiary sources, both quantitative and qualitative, we examine how racial inequality has evolved in Cuba during the last decades. Our analyses of census data suggest that racial stratification has a limited impact on areas such as education, health care, occupation, and positions of leadership. We find, nonetheless, that an expanding and strikingly racialized private sector is fueling dramatic income inequality by skin color beyond the reach of official census data. Our analysis sheds light on how different data can convey profoundly different pictures of racial inequality in a given context. Moreover, we highlight that significant contradictions can coexist in the lived experiences of racism and racial inequality within a single country context.

T1  - Being bisexual in contemporary Italy: between stigma and desire of visibility
TT  - Being bisexual in contemporary Italy
AN  - 2531473956
AB  - PurposeThe Italian sociological scientific community has shown a limited interest in issues related to bisexuality. The purpose of this paper is to fill the knowledge gap on the subject, showing data of an empirical research conducted online on the Italian bisexual community.Design/methodology/approachThe article is based on a mixed methods online survey on Italian bisexual people, which included 218 interviews. The questionnaire was made up of closed and open-ended questions, to investigate their behaviours, habits and lifestyles.FindingsSocial pressure and lack of understanding by others sometimes make difficult for bisexual people to show themselves openly for what they are, especially in some contexts, such as the word of work. From a sociological point of view, one can argue that one of the tools when bisexual people face the stigma related to bisexuality is to control, often in an obsessive way, the information they provide about themselves, carefully evaluating the contexts in which they can free themselves and the time when they must expose themselves in line with the expectations of the heteronormative society.Research limitations/implicationsThe non-probabilistic sample limits the external validity of the findings. There are also critical elements that characterise social research when transposed online: first, the profiles of the respondents not always are verifiable; second, the digital divide excludes some groups that cannot access the web or involves an over-representation of those who are more familiar with technologies.Originality/valueThe work presented is the first Italian sociological study aimed at deepening the “invisible B” phenomenon of the LGBT acronym in a systematic way. Nowadays bisexuality remains under-researched in social sciences and overall in sociology. Putting “bisexuality” at the centre of the sociological attention appears important to provide serious and scientifically valid data and information useful both to develop the knowledge on this identity category and to contain forms of discrimination and prejudice.

T1  - 40 Years of Multiple Social Categorization: A Tool for Social Inclusivity
AN  - 2522250449
AB  - We review a 40-year corpus of research that we collectively name “Multiple Categorisation Theory” (MCT). From early illustrations using the minimal group paradigm, through a focus on how people cognitively represent social diversity, to recent models of outgroup “re-humanisation”, this work has revealed much about how we think about inclusivity, exclusion, and intergroup differences. We review research that assessed ways to reduce intergroup bias by attenuating the reliance on simple categorisation via “crossed categorisation”. We describe how this research evolved from a focus on intergroup differences to incorporate self-categorisation, through processes of decategorisation and increased social identity complexity. Finally, we consider contemporary models that reveal the generalised benefits of multiple categorisation in promoting outgroup “re-humanisation” through “cognitive liberalisation”. We conclude by highlighting the theoretical and practical implications of this research programme.

T1  - Modern Antisemitism as Fetishized Anti-Capitalism: Moishe Postone's Theory and its Historical and Contemporary Relevance
AN  - 2515171596
AB  - The enduring legacy of Moishe Postone's work in the fields of intellectual history, sociology, and social theory also finds expression in his influential theory of modern antisemitism and its role in the Holocaust. Grounded in critical reflections on Marxian thought yet unconvinced by Marxist functionalism, Postone theorizes antisemitism primarily from the perspective of (a critique of) political economy. He conceptualizes modern antisemitism as a fetishized form of anti-capitalism that reifies and personifies the abstract features of modern capitalist society. In so doing, Postone founded a new, revised critical theory framework for the study of modern antisemitism and the origins of the Shoah. For Postone, the Holocaust ought to be understood as the violent attempt to destroy "the abstract"-all actual and perceived evils of modern society associated with it-by way of annihilating the Jews. This article critically reconstructs Postone's theory of antisemitism and situates it in its multi-faceted intellectual context. Moreover, the historical and contemporary meaning of Postone's analysis is discussed against the backdrop of its broader reception and critique. It is argued that Postone, limits of his theory notwithstanding, contributes to understanding the relevance and attraction of antisemitic views across various modern political, spatial, and societal contexts-on the Right, the Left, and beyond.

T1  - Between cultural relativism and liberal ethnocentrism: What does Saudi Arabia tell us about cultural variation in moral identity and prejudice?
AN  - 2513964569
AB  - Cultural conceptions of morality are grounded in diverse moral foundations, but moral identity research often assumes that individualizing concerns are the universal basis for morality. Moral identity scales grounded only in individualizing foundations risk liberal ethnocentrism, to the extent that binding foundations emphasized in collectivist cultures are overlooked. Three hundred and ninety‐five Saudi Arabian and UK participants completed prejudice and moral identity measures, which either narrowly measured only individualizing foundations or broadly measured both binding and individualizing foundations. The broader measure had greater power to predict prejudice scores in both countries, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Generally, moral identities grounded in individualizing foundations predicted less prejudice, while moral identities grounded in binding foundations predicted higher prejudice in both countries. Individualizing measures of moral identity may assess ethnocentric concepts, but recognizing morality grounded in binding considerations may taint the category of moral identity with self‐concepts that are associated with greater—not less—ethnocentrism.

T1  - Performance of social integration programs for immigrants and influential factors: Evidence from the Korea Immigration and Integration Program (KIIP)
AN  - 2549948661
AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze by immigrants' characteristics their participation in and social integration performance on the Korea Immigration and Integration Program (KIIP), which the Korean government provides for education in Korean language and basic knowledge about Korea to support the social integration of immigrants; on that basis, it suggests policy implications. For this purpose, I surveyed 1,014 immigrants, including 800 participants and 214 non-participants of the KIIP; among these individuals, 46.1 % had experienced discrimination. There were several reasons they felt they had been discriminated against; general prejudice against immigrants in South Korea and lack of Korean language ability were the most common. The immigrants who participated in KIIP included several groups: visiting relatives, those who had moved to be with their families, immigrants living in Seoul, Vietnamese people, non-Korean spouses, longer-term non-Korean residents, and non-Han Chinese individuals. Those immigrants who participated in KIIP showed a high degree of adaptability to Korean culture. Korean language proficiency, a key output of KIIP, was the most important factor in improving immigrants' cultural adaptation, sense of societal belonging, and economic conditions.

T1  - Responding to hate incidents on university campuses: benefits and barriers to establishing a restorative justice programme
AN  - 2503528570
AB  - This study examines staff and student perspectives of the use of restorative justice approaches to respond to student-on-student hate crime, hate incidents, and hate speech on university campuses. It draws on qualitative data collated over a one-year period, during the design and establishment of a restorative programme entitled ‘Restore Respect’ at two UK universities. Highlighting examples of students’ experiences of prejudice and hate across the two universities, we outline some of the key barriers to reporting associated with conventional university responses, as well as staff and student views of establishing a new restorative approach to addressing incidents. While early-stage evaluation revealed certain cultural and institutional barriers and limitations to the establishment and operation of a restorative programme, the majority of staff and students viewed it as an effective way of addressing hate-based conduct that would provide greater opportunity for more positive interventions and outcomes. The paper concludes by arguing for a renewed effort to move beyond standard institutional responses to student experiences of hate and prejudice at university through the adoption of restorative, needs-centred approaches.

T1  - The Milan Approach, History, and Evolution
AN  - 2500686245
AB  - The two authors intend to underline the continuities and discontinuities that organize the Milan Approach, after the splitting from Selvini Palazzoli and Prata; they intend to tell the teachings of Luigi Boscolo and Gianfranco Cecchin from the beginning of training in 1978 till nowadays. After having spoken of some important stages in the work till the death of the two masters, the article underlines two major new aspects. 1. We speak about the corporeal turn: embodied experience as preconceptual know‐how from which concepts are structured. We speak about the connections between bodies and social issues that enact forms of knowledge and understanding. 2. In this period of war, violence, and tyranny, we speak about epistemology and ontology as complementary stances: the need to let others disclose themselves, by allowing them to speak their own terms of engagement. The therapeutic effort is one of deactivating the dangers of one’s own presuppositions and prejudices that limit one’s capacity to describe and make hypothesis. There are social ontologies, communities with strong moral intensity, historical and social realities that need therapists to take position, since they need to take side and be aware of the categories they utilize. Historical and social ontology deals with the continuous change of symptoms in connection to the continuous change of the social panorama in the context we live in. We live by the bodies we are.Alternate abstract:Los dos autores se proponen subrayar las continuidades y las discontinuidades que organizan la terapia sistémica de Milán después de la separación de Selvini Palazzoli y Prata, y comunicar las enseñanzas de Luigi Boscolo y Gianfranco Cecchin desde el comienzo de la formación en 1978 hasta la actualidad. Después de haber hablado de algunas etapas importantes en el trabajo hasta la muerte de los dos maestros, el artículo subraya dos aspectos nuevos e importantes. 1. Hablamos acerca del giro corpóreo: la experiencia personificada como conocimiento preconceptual desde el cual se estructuran los conceptos. Hablamos acerca de las conexiones entre los cuerpos y los problemas sociales que representan formas de conocimiento y comprensión. 2. En este periodo de guerra, violencia y tiranía hablamos acerca de la epistemología y la ontología como posturas complementarias: la necesidad de dejar que los demás se den a conocer permitiéndoles comunicar sus propias condiciones de participación. El esfuerzo terapéutico es el de desactivar los peligros de las presuposiciones y los prejuicios propios que limitan la capacidad de una persona para describir y elaborar hipótesis. Hay antologías sociales, comunidades con una intensidad moral fuerte, realidades históricas y sociales que necesitan que los terapeutas adopten una postura, ya que deben tomar partido y ser conscientes de las categorías que utilizan. La ontología histórica y social se ocupa del cambio continuo de síntomas en relación con el cambio continuo del panorama social en el contexto en que vivimos. Vivimos según los cuerpos que somos.Alternate abstract:本研究的两位笔者想强调的是在从塞尔维尼·帕拉佐利和普拉塔分离出来之后，组织米兰法的连续性和非连续性;他们打算讲述Luigi Boscolo和Gianfranco Cecchin从1978年开始训练到现在的教诲。在论述了这两位大师去世前的一些重要阶段后，本文着重强调了两个主要的新方面。1. 我们谈论的是身体感知转向: 即具身感知作为构建概念的那些概念形成之前的经验知识。我们讲的是身体和社会问题之间的联系，这些构成了各种形式的知识和理解。2. 在这个战争、暴力和暴政的时期，我们把认识论和本体论作为一种互补的立场: 通过允许他人自己说出他们自己积极参与的条件情况，认识到让他们披露自己的必要性。这种治疗性旨在尽力消除人们自身的预设和偏见的危险，因为这些预设和偏见限制了人们描述和做出假设的能力。有社会本体，有强烈的道德强度的社区，历史和社会现实需要治疗师采取立场，因为他们需要表明一个立场，并意识到他们所使用的分类。历史本体论和社会本体论处理的是症状的不断变化特征，与我们生活的语境中社会全景的不断变化有关。我们依靠我们的身体生存。

T1  - From ‘Chinky’ to ‘Coronavirus’: racism against Northeast Indians during the Covid-19 pandemic
AN  - 2488477765
AB  - The outbreak of Covid-19 has been highly racialised and stigmatised around the world based on the origin of the virus and its highly infectious nature. Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being ‘non-Indian’ with negative affiliation, or worse ‘unwanted Indians’, but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.

T1  - Race, nose, truth: dystopian odours of the Other in American antebellum consciousness
AN  - 2568241759
AB  - It was in 1835, in the wake of the Nullification Crisis that shook the United States with the threat of civil war over federal law, state’s rights and the Slave Power, that Jerome Holgate, under the pseudonym ‘Oliver Bolokitten’, published his dystopian fiction A Sojourn in the City of Amalgamation. It posited the existence of an African body smell that would make anti-odour machines essential if American societies fell prey to the potential ravages of racial miscegenation. Two decades after Holgate offered his dystopian world-view of smell and race, ‘Cephas Broadluck’, a pseudonym for the American author Allen Gazlay, published Races of Mankind: With Travels in Grubland (1856), an allegorical attack on comparable forms of sensory and sexual ‘amalgamation’, also proposing olfactory detection as a racial protection for the white body politic. The antebellum era dystopias of Holgate and Gazlay combined ideas of truth and race through the sensory experiences of the nose, which had previously been socially conditioned to sense racial Others through a false consciousness about the smell of Africans throughout the Atlantic World. Despite the efforts of academics to deconstruct such absurd beliefs and experiences in the modern world, olfactory racism continues in the languages of both current political leaders and within the bowels of the Internet. Because these prejudicial perceptions continue through what seems for many racists to be biological experiences of truth, scholars must focus much more on analysing embodied perceptions of Othering if academic arguments about the social construction of race are to make any inroads against the return of racist, technologized and fascist modernity in the contemporary West.

T1  - The Systemic Turn and Participatory Budgeting: The Case of Rio Grande do Sul
AN  - 2490565053
AB  - Participatory budgeting (PB) has been one of the most popular local democratic reforms in Latin America in recent decades. This article examines what happened to PB when it was scaled up to the state level and integrated in a participatory system in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (2011–14). Using theories of deliberative systems, multichannel participation, ‘venue shopping’ (the practice of seeking the most favourable policy venue) and countervailing power, as well as a multimethod research design, we explain how the systems approach allowed for both deliberation and direct democracy and mobilised new sectors to participate online. However, on the negative side, the different participation channels undermined each other. Social movements migrated to other spaces, leaving the budgeting process open to control by well-established, powerful public-sector groups.Alternate abstract:El presupuesto participativo (PP; ‘PB’, por sus siglas en inglés) ha sido una de las reformas democráticas locales más populares en Latinoamérica en las décadas recientes.

Utilizando teorías de sistemas deliberativos, participación multicanal, ‘venue shopping’ (búsqueda de los foros más favorables) y contrapoder, así como un diseño de investigación multi-método, explicamos cómo el enfoque de sistemas permitió tanto la democracia deliberativa como la directa y movilizó a nuevos sectores para participar en línea. Sin embargo, por el lado negativo, los diferentes canales participativos se socavaron. Los movimientos sociales migraron a otros espacios, dejando el proceso presupuestal abierto al control de grupos bien establecidos y poderosos del sector público.Alternate abstract:Orçamento Participativo (OP; ‘PB’, das suas siglas em inglês) tem sido uma das reformas locais democráticas mais populares da América Latina nas últimas décadas.

No entanto, também trouxe consequências negativas, quando os diferentes canais de participação prejudicaram uns aos outros. Movimentos sociais migraram a outros espaços, deixando o processo orçamentário sob controle de grupos do setor público já bem estabelecidos e poderosos.

T1  - The Nature of Islamophobia: A Test of a Tripartite View in Five Countries
AN  - 2486099367
AB  - This article provides an examination of the structure of Islamophobia across cultures. Our novel measure—the Tripartite Islamophobia Scale (TIS)—embeds three theoretically and statistically grounded subcomponents of Islamophobia: anti-Muslim prejudice, anti-Islamic sentiment, and conspiracy beliefs. Across six samples (i.e., India, Poland, Germany, France, and the United States), preregistered analyses corroborated that these three subcomponents are statistically distinct. Measurement invariance analyses indicated full scalar invariance, suggesting that the tripartite understanding of Islamophobia is generalizable across cultural contexts. Furthermore, the subcomponents were partially dissociated in terms of the intergroup emotions they are predicted by as well as the intergroup outcomes they predict (e.g., dehumanization, ethnic persecution). For example, intergroup anger and disgust underpin Islamophobic attitudes, over and above the impact of fear. Finally, our results show that social dominance orientation (SDO) and ingroup identification moderate intergroup emotions and Islamophobia. We address both theoretical implications for the nature of Islamophobia and practical interventions to reduce it.

T1  - COVID-19 Stigma and Charismatic Social Relationship: A Legitimization Narrative of President Trump’s Status as a Charismatic Leader following a SARS-CoV-2 Infection Reported by the Portuguese Media
AN  - 2612840847
AB  - This concept paper aimed to understand how stigma, a concept usually associated with negative social relationships, in the context of a pandemic threat such as COVID-19 can, in some situations, structure a charismatic social relationship in a perceived positive association between stigma and a specific social characteristic. For this purpose, we used the example of the news selected and highlighted by several Portuguese media about the actions and messages developed by President Trump in the context of his infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent recovery process. These news reports gave visibility to a narrative that can be considered as reinforcing the legitimization of his condition as a charismatic leader in an electoral context marked by the pandemic threat. In conclusion, stigma associated with a pandemic health threat and generally linked to a negative social status can also reinforce admiration, trust, and belief in the charismatic leader by supporters and followers, as demonstrated with the plight of President Trump. Stigma can be a factor in social uplift in affirming an upward trajectory of social status and symbolic power for actors seen as ill, where stigma-motivated discrimination is experienced positively, unlike in most cases.

AN  - 2586551427
AB  - This article examines the plight of migrant Muslim garbage pickers during the COVID-19 lockdown in India and their struggles to return home to Assam. Their financial hardships were exacerbated by social, political, and religious prejudices. Belonging to the Bengali-speaking miya community, deemed "Bangladeshi," government authorities neglected them. The lockdown's hyped-up anti-Muslim propaganda also reduced them to "corona jihadis." The author reads their struggles as a case study of the Muslim condition in India and argues for civic engagement for redressing the condition of the marginal and vulnerable. The research was conducted through telephone and Zoom calls and in-person interviews.Alternate abstract:Članek obravnava stiske migrantskih muslimanskih smetarjev med popolnim zaprtjem javnega življenja v Indiji in njihova prizadevanja za vrnitev v rodno pokrajino Assam. Družbeni, politični in verski predsodki so njihove finančne težave še povečali. Zaradi njihove pripadnosti bengalsko govoreči skupnosti miya, ki izvira iz Bangladeša, se indijske oblasti zanje niso menile, okrepljena protimuslimanska propaganda jih je v času lockdowna obravnavala kot »korona džihadiste«. Avtorica njihov boj za preživetje obravnava v okviru splošnega položaja muslimanov v Indiji, obenem pa se zavzema, da bi civilna družba naredila več za izboljšanje položaja najbolj marginaliziranih in ranljivih skupin. Raziskava je bila izvedena po telefonu, aplikaciji Zoom in z osebnimi intervjuji.

T1  - Obilježja multikulturalizma i sekularizma u indijskom društvu
TT  - Characteristics of Multiculturalism and Secularism in Indian Society
AN  - 2584028117
AB  - U kontekstu istraživanja odnosa sekularizma i multikulturalizma u suvremenoj Indiji u radu se tematizira specifičnost njihove povezanosti, indijski jedinstveni pristup sekularizmu kao ideji principijelne distance, odnosno način prilagodbe religijskom pluralizmu, iz čega proizlazi bliskost s multikulturalizmom. Nasuprot nekim mišljenjima da je sekularizam stran indijskoj civilizaciji, selektivnim odabirom primjera kroz povijest u radu se ilustrira šire značenje »indijske« religijske i sekularne misli te se upozorava na važnost interakcije različitih religijskih kultura i supkultura, posebice doticaja hinduizma i islama/sufizma. Težište je rada na analizi indijskoga ustavnog sekularizma i zakonski zajamčenog multikulturalizma. Rasprave o multikulturalizmu idu u dva smjera: jedan razmatra multikulturalizam kao državnu politiku u obliku federalizacije političkog sustava, dok se drugi bavi značenjem multikulturalizma i njegovim implikacijama na individualna i grupna prava, kulturu, religiju i sekularizam. Rad se dotiče i utjecaja britanske kolonijalne vladavine na formiranje međureligijskih odnosa u nezavisnoj Indiji. U posljednjem dijelu problematizira se jačanje hinduističkog nacionalizma, posebice nakon dolaska na vlast stranke Bharatiya Đanata (BJP) 2014. i usvajanja nove »ideje« Indije, napose hinduističkoga nacionalističkog narativa, što dovodi u pitanje indijsku službenu ideologiju sekularizma te položaj manjina, osobito muslimanske.Alternate abstract:In the context of research into the relationship between secularism and multiculturalism in contemporary India, this paper points to their specific interrelatedness and the distinctive Indian approach to secularism through the idea of a principled distance as a way to adjust to religious pluralism that has a close affinity with multiculturalism. Contrary to opinions that secularism is alien to the Indian civilisation, by a selection of instances through Indian history, the paper illustrates the broader meaning of "Indian" religious and secular thinking and also points to the significance of interaction among various religious cultures and subcultures, particularly between Hinduism and Islam/Sufism. However, the paper focuses on the analysis of Indian constitutional secularism and legally warranted multiculturalism. Debates on multiculturalism follow two distinct directions: the first examines multiculturalism as a state policy in the form of federalisation of its political system, whereas the second is concerned with the meaning of multiculturalism and its implications for the issues of individual and group rights, culture, religion, and secularism. It also touches upon the influence of the British colonial rule on the shaping of interreligious relations in independent India. The last section questions the ascendancy of Hindu nationalism, particularly in view of the rise to power of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014, its appropriation of the new "idea" of India, especially the Hindu nationalist narrative, which endangers India's official ideology of secularism, as well as the position of the minorities, in particular of the Muslim minority. The article is divided into seven sections. The Introduction outlines, in general, the main distinction between secularism and multiculturalism and their relationship, referring to the two principal approaches to secularism: (1) neutrality between different religions, and (2) prohibition of religious associations in state activities. Indian secularism tends to emphasise neutrality in particular rather than prohibition in general. The second section, Traces of the Indian Secular Thought through History, examines the view, particularly pervasive among Hindutva supporters, that secularism is alien to the Indian civilisation from the perspectives of history and philosophy, which both provide evidence that "the constituents of secularism which make up the concept are not alien to Indian thought" (Thapar, 2013: 4). In this context, the most evoked name in connection with religious tolerance is that of Ashoka Maurya, who in his edicts called not only for the co-existence of all religious sects but also for equal respect for those who represented them. Many centuries later, Moghul Emperor Akbar supported dialogue across adherents of different religions, including atheists. He laid the formal foundations of a secular legal structure and religious neutrality of the state. The paper here also points to the significance of interaction among various religious cultures and subcultures, the more so between Hinduism and Islam/Sufism. It focuses on extending the meaning of "Indian" religion in the sense that it includes multiple religions, such as Brahmanism, Buddhism, Jainism, Bhakti, Shakta, Islam/ Sufism, Guru-Pir tradition, which, but for Brahmanism, challenge orthodoxy by giving greater weight to social ethics rather than to prescriptive religious texts. The third section, Multiculturalism in Indian Context, refers to the Indian legally warranted multiculturalism and relating debates followed by two distinct directions. The first examines multiculturalism as a state policy in the form of federalisation of its political system; a process which involves the political accommodation of ethnic identities, which remains the most effective method of management and resolution of conflicts. The second direction is concerned with the meaning of multiculturalism and its implications for the issues of individual and group rights, culture, religion, secularism. According to Rajeev Bhargava (1999: 35, 2007), cultural particularity might undermine the "common foundation for a viable society", and might also lessen individual freedom, thus invalidating the values of liberal democracy. From there follows the question of constitutional protection of personal laws of religious communities, which is, in a way, in collision with the primary secular identity, that of a citizen (Thapar, 2010, 2013). The fourth section, Characteristics of Indian Secularism, analyses in some detail the Articles of the Indian Constitution concerned with the basic understanding of secularism, i.e., that religion must be separated from the state "for the sake of religious liberty and equality of citizenship." The analysis indicates that, while some Articles (Indian Constitution, Articles 25–26) depart from the mainstream western secularism, others are close to the Western liberal leanings, like those stipulating that the state will have no official religion (constitutional amendment 42) or that no religious instruction will be allowed in educational institutions maintained wholly out of state funds, as well as that no person attending any educational institution receiving financial aid from state funds shall be required to take part in compulsory attendance at religious instruction or worship (Articles 27–28/1/). But, more specifically, the idea of a principled distance from religious pluralism points to India's highly contextual, thus distinctively Indian, version of secularism. The fifth section, The Question of Indian Identity, argues that, with the inauguration of democracy in India, multiculturalism was adopted as a policy of recognising and respecting diversity, guaranteeing the protection and rights of minorities and positive discrimination for the historically marginalised, and emphasising intergroup equality, while leaving the issue of intragroup equality somewhat aside. In the last section, Challenges of Hindu Nationalistic Ideology, the author points to some manifestations of the current ascendency of Hindu nationalism, particularly resulting from the Bharatiya Janata Party coming to power in 2014, such as the increasing identification of state leaders with Hindu cultural symbols and, at the same time, decreasing official support for the public festivals of minorities, Mus lims and Christians in the first place. According to Hindu nationalists, most Muslims and Christians are converts from Hinduism and should therefore recognise the precedence of the Hindu culture in India. Anti-Muslim prejudice in India stems not from the ideas of their racial or cultural differences but, above all, from questioning their loyalty to India. Here emerges the question of the "secular nationalism" of the Congress Party as opposed to the "Hindu nationalism" of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which insists on Hinduism as the essential token of the Indian national identity, implying cultural and political pre-eminence of Hindus in India. The Conclusion summarises some of the main points regarding the relationship between secularism and multiculturalism in the Indian context, indicating that despite the present challenges that Hindu nationalism poses to both, "…the Indian experience suggests that some form of moderate secularism will continue to remain necessary as a state framework to check the advance of religious majoritarianism" (Bajpai, 2017: 224). The author assumes that the article offers some constructive avenues for future studies on secularism and multiculturalism, which should not only provide further insights into the Indian case but also enhance the understanding of the varieties of secular trajectories worldwide, as well as their implications for democracy.

T1  - Justice Sensitivity Is Positively and Negatively Related to Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2576370322
AB  - The trait justice sensitivity captures individual differences in the tendency to perceive injustice and to negatively respond to these perceptions. The tendency to negatively respond to injustice to ones disadvantage (victim justice sensitivity) was reliably linked to different measures of antisocial behavior and conservative values. Thus, we assumed that victim justice sensitivity should also be positively related to prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, the tendency to negatively respond to injustice to the disadvantage of others (altruistic justice sensitivity), was reliably linked to prosocial behavior. Hence, we assumed that altruistic justice sensitivity should also show negative relations with prejudice and discrimination. In order to test these assumptions, we surveyed justice sensitivity, prejudices against three different groups, and discrimination experiences among N=343 participants (M=26.61 years, 79 percent women) in Germany. We found that victim justice sensitivity predicted more self-perpetrated discrimination. Altruistic justice sensitivity predicted less total prejudice and self-perpetrated discrimination and mediated the link between self-experienced discrimination and prejudice/self-perpetrated discrimination unless age, gender, and education were controlled for. Discrimination can promote discrimination. Future research on correlates and potential risk and protective factors of prejudice and discrimination should also consider justice sensitivity as a moral-related trait.

T1  - Solidarity Actions Based on Religious Plurality
AN  - 2565667171
AB  - The successive crises experienced recently (financial crisis in 2008, refugees in 2015 and the current crisis resulting from COVID) have led to surges in discrimination, racism and lack of solidarity between groups. However, these same crises have inspired important manifestations of solidarity with a significant social impact (improving people’s lives) for many groups and in very different areas. This article focuses on two solidarity initiatives (interreligious language pairs and a cooperative) that contribute to overcoming inequalities and the social exclusion of the most vulnerable groups, to explore whether religious plurality and the interreligious dialogue present in these initiatives are a favourable element for solidarity.

T1  - Condom-Protected Sex and Minority Stress: Associations with Condom Negotiation Self-Efficacy, “Passing” Concerns, and Experiences with Misgendering among Transgender Men and Women in Brazil
AN  - 2528255188
AB  - This cross-sectional exploratory study aims to verify associations between condom-protected sex, condom negotiation self-efficacy, self-esteem, and four minority stressors (experiences with misgendering, “passing” concerns, anticipated prejudice, and perceived prejudice) among transgender men (TM) and transgender women (TW). 260 individuals (192 TW and 68 TM) residing in two Brazilian states participated in the study. Data was collected online and in two hospital programs for transgender people and included sociodemographic data, condom-protected sex, the Trans-Specific Condom/Barrier Negotiation Self-Efficacy (T-Barrier) Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and four minority stressors. Measures that were significantly associated with condom-protected sex were tested as independent variables in a linear regression model. The main results suggest that lower condom negotiation self-efficacy, higher “passing” concerns, and higher experiences with misgendering were predictors of lower frequency of condom-protected sex. These negative outcomes were found among both TM and TW, which justifies their inclusion in public health policies. Structural strategies and clinical interventions are suggested to address condom negotiation self-efficacy and “passing” concerns in transgender populations.

T1  - Inequality on the Increase: Trajectories of Privilege and Inequality in Madrid
AN  - 2526831499
AB  - In Spain, housing is one of the main axes of social inequality. Its position within Spain’s economic model and welfare system is key to understanding why its financialization at the beginning of the 21st century had such different consequences among residents as well as territorially. In this context, from 2001 to 2011, Madrid became one of the most segregated metropolitan areas in Europe. This article delves into how both housing and its location organise inequality in different social spheres and reproduce it over time. To this end, the geography of this inequality is analysed in different social residential trajectories, along with how segregation produces its own dynamics of inequality. The analysis is based on census data and applies a combination of factor and cluster analyses. The results reveal important processes of social residential marginalisation articulated by the interaction between high international immigration and the spatial manifestation of the housing bubble. The main socio-spatial result of this process is the disappearance of mixed social spaces in Madrid, previously located in the centre of the city. This dynamic produces opposite territories in terms of advantage and disadvantage in different spheres linked to social inequality such as education, health, leisure, care and even prejudice. In the process, impoverished immigrants disperse towards the neighbourhoods that concentrate the greatest disadvantages in each of these spheres.

T1  - Psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2516239068
AB  - We studied the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes of Syrian refugees in Turkey using semi-structured, face-to-face, in-depth interviews among 15 participants. The study explored the themes and issues emerging in the psychological and socio-cultural adaptation processes such as life-satisfaction, contact with the host community and future plans of Syrian adults. Berry's acculturation model (1997) is used to form the theoretical basis of this research. Our findings revealed that psychological and socio-cultural adaptation of Syrian refugees are strongly influenced by economic concerns, pre-migration expectations, religion and perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians. From the perspective of the informants, economic concerns and uncertainty regarding duration of stay have a negative impact on refugees' acculturation, leading to delayed psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. Positive perceptions of Turkish natives' expectations/ attitudes towards Syrians are perceived to increase motivation to seek social support, which promotes well-being and life satisfaction in Turkey. Yet, negative perceptions such as prejudice and discrimination, may pose a risk for psychological health and low socio-cultural adaptation. One major finding of the paper is the two-fold impact of religion on Syrian refugees: Religion can be considered a binding/ equalizing function subsuming refugee and native groups under a superordinate identity. Nonetheless, it also appears to generate social distance when perceived as a threat to the secular national identity. The findings of this research can be used to minimize factors that undermine favorable acculturation outcomes and promote factors that facilitate high levels of psychological and socio-cultural adaptation.

T1  - Koreans' attitudes toward China and Chinese people: The effect of direct contact experience
AN  - 2512819498
AB  - Although the number of Chinese immigrants moving to South Korea has increased in the past decade Koreans still hold negative attitudes toward China and the Chinese populace. To discover whether this prejudice can be reduced, we examined the effect of direct contact with Chinese people on Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people. Participants in our study were 91 Korean university students who were divided into two groups based on their contact experience with people from China. The contact group (n = 43) and the noncontact group (n = 48) both completed a cultural experience questionnaire, the Explicit Attitude Questionnaire, and the Implicit Association Test. According to the results, the contact group displayed more positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people than did the noncontact group. These findings suggest that it may be possible to improve Koreans' perception of China and relations with Chinese people by increasing direct contact experience between the two communities.

T1  - How to Foster Empathy in Anti-discrimination Initiatives? Implication for Social Interventions-A Qualitative Approach
AN  - 2491986183
AB  - L'objectif de cette étude était d'explorer les antécédents de la réponse empathique dans le contexte de la réception des publicités sociales anti-discrimination. Nous avons examiné, par le biais des entretiens de groupe qualitatifs, les antécédents contextuels qui sont susceptibles de faciliter la prise de perspective et le partage émotionnel. 61 personnes ont participé â cette étude, dont 43 femmes et 18 hommes. Les entretiens de groupe semi-dirigés ont duré entre 40 minutes et 2 heures. Les enregistrements ont été transcrits et analysés â l'aide de NVivo. Nous avons effectué un codage mixte des données et nous avons analysé les entretiens selon les principes de l'analyse thématique. Les analyses ont révélé que certains types d'expressions faciales des émotions, deux types de similarité perçue et les éléments mettant en valeur l'humanité commune jouent un röle important dans le déclenchement des réponses empathique dans ce contexte particulier. Bien qu'il soit nécessaire de promouvoir la diversité, nos résultats indiquent que les interventions futures devraient mettre l'accent sur l'humanité commune entre les groupes et la promotion de la diversité devrait étre accompagnée d'un effort équivalent â promouvoir les ressemblances entre les groupes. En outre, les résultats présentés ici peuvent étre utilisés afin de bâtir des interventions plus efficaces et plus appropriées qui cherchent â induire de l'empathie envers les groupes discriminés et marginalisés.Alternate abstract:The purpose of this study was to explore antecedents of empathic responding in the context of antidiscrimination public service announcement (PSA) reception. We sought to qualitatively examine which contextual antecedents are likely to play a role in facilitating the perspective taking and emotion sharing processes. Recruitment through the local university's mailing list and an online classified advertising service yielded 61 participants: 18 men and 43 women. Semi-structured focus group interviews lasted from 40 minutes to two hours. The recordings were transcribed and analyzed using NVivo. We used a mixed approach to coding and analyzed the interviews using the process of thematic analysis. The analyses revealed that certain facial expressions of emotion, two types of perceived similarity and a focus on common humanity play an important role in triggering empathic responses in this type of context. While it is necessary to promote diversity, these findings indicate that future interventions should focus on emphasizing a common humanity between the groups and that the accentuation of differences should also be accompanied by a focus on similarities. The results of the current study can be used to build more appropriate and efficient intervention strategies that aim to foster empathy for discriminated and marginalized groups.

T1  - Multimodal transport and potential encounters with social difference: A novel approach based on network analysis
AN  - 2480631985
AB  - Direct experience of social difference is crucial if lower levels of prejudice and greater social cohesion are to be achieved in our cities. Despite their key role of connecting places and people, transport infrastructures have scarcely been assessed as facilitators of encounters with social difference. Furthermore, urban contexts are progressively more complex due to the increasing relevance of transport multimodality along with the unequal degree of access to different transport modes. Building upon network analysis and consolidated accessibility measures, this study presents multi-accessibility as a concept and quantitative instrument to evaluate the potential encounter of difference in city spaces opened up by multimodal transport infrastructures. Multi-accessibility is also presented as a relevant and complementary policy avenue to enhancing social cohesion through transport planning and land use policies in the future. Two planning scenarios for the case of the Madrid metropolitan area illustrate the application, utility and interpretability of the instrument.

T1  - How the Coronavirus Lockdown Impacts the Impoverished in India
AN  - 2479062934
AB  - In response to the coronavirus pandemic, several countries have imposed curfews, quarantines, and lockdowns to restrict the spread of the infection among people. India had initiated a nationwide lockdown to combat the pandemic starting from the last week of March until the end of May 2020. But, the lockdown had continued subsequently in several red zones across parts of the country for few months. However, scientists have criticized the government’s abrupt lockdown since it prevented people from preparing for the worst aftermath. Besides, the curfews have blocked millions of impoverished migrant workers from leaving cities to return to their homes in distant rural villages. As a result, the destitute workers have endured enormous hardship and outright discrimination desolately leading to their added physical and mental distress, pain, suffering, and death. Most of the victims of the lockdown have belonged to the economically distressed lower social classes of the Indian caste hierarchy. This article outlines their sufferings triggered by the long drawn-out lockdown episode.

T1  - Country-Level Structural Stigma, School-Based and Adulthood Victimization, and Life Satisfaction Among Sexual Minority Adults: A Life Course Approach
AN  - 2478870917
AB  - Country-level structural stigma, defined as prejudiced population attitudes and discriminatory legislation and policies, has been suggested to compromise the wellbeing of sexual minority adults. This study explores whether and how structural stigma might be associated with sexual minorities’ school-based and adulthood experiences of victimization and adulthood life satisfaction. Using a sample of 55,263 sexual minority individuals (22% female; 53% 18–29 years old; 85% lesbian/gay, 15% bisexual) living across 28 European countries and a country-level index of structural stigma, results show that sexual minorities, especially men, reported school bullying in both higher- and lower-stigma countries. Higher rates of school bullying were found among sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries when open about their identity at school. Past exposure to school bullying was associated with lower adulthood life satisfaction, an association partially explained by an increased risk of adulthood victimization. These findings suggest that sexual minorities living in higher-stigma countries might benefit from not being open about their sexual identity at school, despite previously established mental health costs of identity concealment, because of the reduced risk of school bullying and adverse adulthood experiences. These results provide one of the first indications that structural stigma is associated with sexual minority adults’ wellbeing through both contemporaneous and historical experiences of victimization.

T1  - Prejudice and Tolerance in US Presidential Politics: Evidence from Eight List Experiments in 2008 and 2012
AN  - 2475760390
AB  - Using list experiments on the 2008 and 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project, we investigated whether respondents are more likely to vote against presidential candidates from marginalized groups. We show that conservative and Republican respondents are disinclined to support Muslim and gay candidates. However, neither Right- nor Left-leaning respondents are significantly opposed to female candidates. Surprisingly, we uncovered asymmetric prejudices toward Mormons and African Americans. In both 2008 and 2012, Republicans were far more uncomfortable with gay or Muslim candidates than with African American candidates (per se). However, Democrats in 2012 were deeply uncomfortable with Mormon candidates. These findings illustrate that prejudice in presidential politics is not confined to right-wing pathologies alone but is present on both sides of the partisan–ideological divide.

T1  - Heteronormativity, Disgust Sensitivity, and Hostile Attitudes toward Gay Men: Potential Mechanisms to Maintain Social Hierarchies
AN  - 2474584042
AB  - Within a social hierarchy based on sexual orientation, heteronormative ideology serves as a social force that maintains dominant group members’ status (e.g., heterosexual men). Disgust may be an emotional reaction to gay men’s violation of heteronormativity (i.e., same-sex sexual behavior) and motivate hostile attitudes toward gay men to promote interpersonal and intergroup boundaries. Based on this theoretical framework, we hypothesized that sexual disgust—compared to pathogen or moral disgust—would be most strongly associated with antigay hostility and would statistically mediate its relationship with heteronormativity. Heterosexual men in the United States (n = 409) completed an online questionnaire assessing heteronormative ideology, disgust sensitivity, and hostile attitudes toward gay men. Results support the hypotheses and suggest that gay men’s sexual behavior is the most likely elicitor of disgust and antigay hostility, as opposed to a perceived pathogen threat or moral transgression. The findings indicate that heteronormative attitudes and sexual disgust are likely contributors to antigay hostility. Thus, intervention efforts should seek to improve tolerance of same-sex sexual behavior among heterosexual men, which may mitigate emotional reactions and hostile attitudes toward gay men.

T1  - Social Class Competence Stereotypes Are Amplified by Socially Signaled Economic Inequality
AN  - 2470251269
AB  - A number of psychological theories suggest that increased economic inequality may lead to greater social class stereotyping. However, all existing evidence for this claim is correlational. Across three experiments (one exploratory and two confirmatory, N = 2,286), we observed that exposure to socially signaled inequality—operationalized in terms of variation in perceived incomes among groups of target individuals—amplified the endorsement of one key social class stereotype: the perception that higher income individuals are more competent. When judged amid greater inequality, the same high-income targets were perceived as more competent and the same low-income targets were perceived as less competent, compared with when judged amid greater equality. By contrast, we found no consistent effect of exposure to inequality on stereotypes regarding warmth and relatively weak class-based stereotyping on the warmth dimension in general. We discuss implications of these findings for theories regarding the effects of economic inequality.

T1  - Life as an Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Male Prisoner: Poems of Grief, Trauma, Hope, and Resistance
AN  - 2473719170
AB  - For Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, writing is predominantly about articulating their cultural belonging and identity. Published creative writing, which is a relatively new art form among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander prisoners, has not been used as an outlet to the same extent as other forms of art. This is, however, changing as more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander rappers and story-writers emerge, and as creative writing is used as a way to express Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander empowerment and resistance against discriminatory and oppressive government policies. This article explores the use of poetry and stories written by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander male prisoners in a correctional facility located in southern New South Wales, Australia, to understand how justice is perceived by people who are (and have been) surrounded by hardships, discrimination, racism, and grief over the loss of their culture, families, and freedom.Alternate abstract:Pour les aborigènes d’Australie et les insulaires du détroit de Torres, l’écriture consiste principalement à exprimer, et à articuler, leur appartenance culturelle et leur identité. La publication d’une écriture créatrice, qui est une forme d’art relativement nouvelle parmi les prisonniers aborigènes et insulaires du détroit de Torres, n’a pas été utilisée comme un exutoire au même titre que d’autres formes d’art. Cependant, la situation est en train de changer avec l’émergence de rappeurs et d’écrivains aborigènes et des insulaires du détroit de Torres, et l’utilisation de l’écriture créative comme moyen d’exprimer leur autonomisation et leur résistance aux politiques gouvernementales discriminatoires et oppressives. Cet article explore l’utilisation de la poésie et des histoires écrites par des prisonniers de sexe masculin aborigènes et insulaires du détroit de Torres dans un établissement correctionnel situé dans le sud de la Nouvelle-Galles-du-Sud, en Australie. Une exploration qui vise à comprendre comment la justice est perçue par des personnes qui sont (et ont été) entourées de difficultés, de discrimination, de racisme et de chagrin à la suite de la perte de leur culture, de leur famille et de leur liberté.

T1  - Afterword: Between Self and Other
AN  - 2472036533
AB  - In the thought-provoking papers that constitute ‘Stranger Races: Reflections on Alterity in Constructions of the Self’, the authors make clear that our always already social confrontation with alterity is complex, multifaceted and context sensitive. They also make clear that thinking about alterity is a central, if not the central, element of anthropological study, an endeavour that sheds light on such socially destructive forces as primitivism, essentialism, racism, and ethnic and religious discrimination. In the essays, the authors also stress, albeit indirectly, that the dynamic linkages between self and other cannot be reduced a set of rules or an abstract formula. Indeed, the tangled nature of processes that play out in the construction of identity cry out for ethnographic elaboration. For me, the most important contribution that the authors make devolves from their exploration of the turbulent conceptual space between self and other. It is the space between self and other that is important to explore. As the essays in this special issue demonstrate, in the creative space between self and other, we are able to extend anthropological practice to the public domain in order to showcase alternatives to xenophobia and prejudice and to advocate for social practices that celebrate mutual respect. That is a path that leads to a powerfully productive anthropological future.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2471587136
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - Imagined contact with strongly identified outgroup members: Do religious trappings make the man?
AN  - 2460549178
AB  - This research examined the interactive effects of imagined contact and the characteristics of the imagined person on intergroup anxiety and prejudice, among two groups in Israel: Jewish majority and Arab‐Muslim minority. In total, 128 Jewish and 128 Arab‐Muslim participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. They were exposed to an outgroup person wearing either casual clothing or religious‐ethnic trappings. Then they were required to imagine either a pleasant conversation with that person at a cafeteria or a pleasant hike in which the outgroup person was just seen strolling around. Finally, participants filled out questionnaires of intergroup anxiety and prejudice. For Jewish participants in the hiking conditions, higher intergroup anxiety was found after imagining a strongly identified outgroup person rather than a weakly identified person. This effect was eliminated after imagining a pleasant conversation with the outgroup member in the cafeteria conditions. In addition, Jewish participants reported more outgroup prejudice following imagined scenarios which included the strongly identified person compared to scenarios involving the weakly identified person. For Arab‐Muslim participants, however, no effects were found. This study highlights the importance of considering the characteristics of outgroup counterparts in the field of imagined contact. Furthermore, the implications of imagined contact with individuals wearing religious‐ethnic trappings are discussed.

T1  - The unique nature of public stigma toward non‐medical prescription opioid use and dependence: a national study: (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction)
AN  - 2459067609
AB  - Background and AimsOur ability to combat the opioid epidemic depends, in part, on dismantling the stigma that surrounds drug use. However, this epidemic has been unique and, to date, we have not understood the nature of public prejudices associated with it. Here, we examine the nature and magnitude of public stigma toward prescription opioid use disorder (OUD) using the only nationally representative data available on this topic.DesignGeneral Social Survey (GSS), a cross‐sectional, nationally representative survey of public attitudes.SettingUnited States, 2018.Participants/CasesA total of 1169 US residents recruited using a probability sample.MeasurementsRespondents completed a vignette‐based survey experiment to assess public stigma toward people who develop OUD following prescription of opioid analgesics. This condition is compared with depression, schizophrenia, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and subclinical distress using multivariable logistic or linear regression.FindingsAdjusting for covariates (e.g. race, age, gender), US residents were significantly more likely to label symptoms of OUD a physical illness [73%, confidence interval (CI) = 66–80%; P < 0.001] relative to all other conditions, and less likely to label OUD a mental illness (40%, CI = 32–48%; P < 0.001). OUD was significantly less likely to be attributed to bad character (37%, CI = 30–44%; P < 0.001) or poor upbringing (17%, CI = 12–23%; P < 0.001) compared with AUD. Nonetheless, perceptions of competence associated with OUD (e.g. ability to manage money; 41%, CI = 33–49%; P < 0.01) were lower than AUD, depression and subclinical distress. Moreover, willingness to socially exclude people with OUD was very high (e.g. 76% of respondents do not want to work with a person with OUD), paralleling findings on traditional targets of strong stigma (i.e. AUD and schizophrenia).ConclusionsUS residents do not typically hold people with prescription opioid use disorder responsible for their addiction, but they express high levels of willingness to subject them to social exclusion.

T1  - Mainstream Marginalization: Secret Political Organizing Through Social Media
AN  - 2474691648
AB  - Scholars have addressed how the socially marginalized, individuals with fringe viewpoints, or the politically marginalized in authoritarian regimes use social media to organize or connect in secret. Yet intensifying partisan polarization and prejudice in the United States has made it necessary to study how mainstream partisans in liberal democracies use social media to organize in secret. This study explores why mainstream partisans in the United States—average Republicans or Democrats—organize in secret online and analyzes the unique functions of social media for political organizing amid contextual marginalization. Through interviews with group leaders and a digital ethnography of a secret Facebook group in the United States, I find that mainstream partisans use social media to form secret political groups when they are the minority in their local community and that the online secret group serves several unique functions for members. First, the group operates as a community of solidarity for those reticent to disclose their political beliefs and as a community of contention to criticize and revitalize the minority Party in their region. The group also operates as a community of practice, allowing members to learn and rehearse communication among like-minded others. These findings hold implications for how scholars study communication in a digital and polarized era and how practitioners gauge public opinion.

T1  - Religion, Prejudicial Beliefs toward Sexual Minorities and Same-Sex Relations, and Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage: Hate the Sin but Love the Sinner
AN  - 2474284467
AB  - This study employs data from the NORC General Social Surveys to assess the extent, if any, to which the effects of both religious affiliation and personal religiosity on opposition to same-sex marriage are attenuated once effects for prejudice against same-sex relations (hate the sin) and prejudice against sexual minorities (hate the sinner) are controlled. Our results show that an initially robust set of affiliation and religiosity effects are substantially reduced once the effect of prejudice against same-sex relations is controlled but remains relatively unchanged when a control for prejudice against sexual minorities is introduced. The implications of these findings and potential explanations for the persistent religious effect on opposition to same-sex marriage are also discussed.

T1  - Distrust persists after subverting atheist stereotypes: GPIR
AN  - 2451091742
AB  - Antiatheist prejudice appears to be common. This prejudice may stem from distrust. However, the factors influencing distrust are not fully understood. The current research identified common stereotypes about atheists, tested the intuitiveness of those stereotypes, and determined whether distrust toward atheists depends more on the label “atheist” or the attributes atheists are thought to possess. Study 1 (N = 100) and Study 2 (N = 149) identified several attributes thought to be most characteristic of atheists and least characteristic of Christians (or vice versa). Study 3 (N = 219) demonstrated that atheists and Christians are intuitively associated with the respective traits identified in Studies 1 and 2. Study 4 (N = 274) and Study 5 (N = 259) used fake social media profiles to manipulate target religious identification (atheist, Christian, or unspecified) and attributes (stereotypically atheist or stereotypically Christian) to determine the effect on trust ratings. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that atheists and Christians are explicitly and implicitly associated with different attributes and that, even when atheists possess stereotypically Christian attributes, Christians trust atheists significantly less than other Christians. These findings suggest that antiatheist prejudice is relatively insensitive to individual differences of the target.

T1  - <i>Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi</i> and its topicality
AN  - 2449123217
AB  - Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi is a recently released Indian historical biopic of Rani Lakshmi Bai. Through historical re-imagining, the film renders several potential social and political issues, which are topical and timely in contemporary India. The present article attempts to examine the topicality of the film. First, it discusses how it rekindles the female heroic tradition of India, which has been overshadowed due to the patriarchal mindset and historiography. Secondly, it explores how, through cinematic liberties, issues like gauraksha, Hindutva, and patriotism have been propagated. Thirdly, it argues how by foregrounding Dalits and Muslims, the film attempts to neutralise extremist Hindu prejudices, dominant in the hyper-nationalist climate of India. The article concludes that by recreating a crucial historical epoch and a legend, the film attempts to reinstate a secular heritage of India’s heroic tradition to rekindle nationalistic and patriotic sensibility among the contemporary masses.

T1  - US prisms and prejudice through mediating the Middle East: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2447816139
AB  - Mediating the Middle East engages social and political constructions that articulate sentiment within the United States, with consequences not only to foreign policies and relationships, but also to experiences of Arab and Muslim citizens. Engagement with media narratives is expected to become particularly relevant when people do not share a resonating identity or direct experience with the community being projected. I position this research as an entry into how we might understand the primacy of dominant media narratives in shaping norms that contribute to discriminatory practices. Through this analysis, I focus on the concerns of Arab and Muslim Americans, considering the consequences of negative media characterizations of Islam, of Arab communities, and of the Middle East. This study builds on a national survey of adult United States citizens (n = 1416), with a targeted proportion of Arab American residents. These attitudes toward fellow citizens as well as foreign countries are considered in relation to extent of engagement with popular culture, specifically action-adventure given its role in Hollywood narratives featuring the Middle East. Attitudes toward Arab and Muslim communities within the United States as well as in the Middle East are demonstrated to be related to this form of media engagement.

T1  - Evaluating the independence of age, sex, and race in judgment of faces
AN  - 2456878308
AB  - Extracting the dimensions of age, sex, race from faces is fundamental for many aspects of social cognition such as person construal, impression formation, and social interaction. While cognitive researchers consider these dimensions to be independent in processing, social psychology researchers have recently demonstrated the emergence of strong interactive patterns between these categories, especially, when social biases are involved. The current study harnessed the classic Garner's speeded classification task (Garner, 1974) and Stroop task (1935) to evaluate the level of independence between age, sex, and race in a systematic and exhaustive fashion, with an eye on the potential influence of social biases. The degree of separability was evaluated in a pairwise fashion, with each experiment testing one pair. In Experiment 1a and 1b, sex and race were tested with strong (Experiment 1b) or weak (Experiment 1a) social bias. Experiment 2 was set to assess the separability of sex and race. And Experiment 3 was aimed at evaluating the separability of age and sex. The results revealed that neither of the pairs of dimensions produced Garner interferences (and are therefore separable dimensions). However, when strong social bias was present, the dimensions did produce redundancy gains and Stroop-like effects, which reflected the presence of abiding social biases. A holistic-to-analytic model is presented to account for these results, according to which, the dimensions are initially processed as integral dimensions, but then become gradually separable.

T1  - Supporting Older Homeless Persons' Positive Relocations to Long-Term Care: Service Provider Views
AN  - 2451553432
AB  - Background and Objectives This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

T1  - Implicit race attitudes modulate visual information extraction for trustworthiness judgments
AN  - 2445951832
AB  - Black people are still considered to be one of the most stigmatized groups and have to face multiple prejudices that undermine their well-being. Assumptions and beliefs about other racial groups are quite pervasive and have been shown to impact basic social tasks such as face processing. For example, individuals with high racial prejudice conceptualize other-race faces as less trustworthy and more criminal. However, it is unknown if implicit racial bias could modulate even low-level perceptual mechanisms such as spatial frequency (SF) extraction when judging the level of trustworthiness of other-race faces. The present study showed that although similar facial features are used to judge the trustworthiness of White and Black faces, own-race faces are processed in lower SF (i.e. coarse information such as the contour of the face and blurred shapes as opposed to high SF representing fine-grained information such as eyelashes or fine wrinkles). This pattern was modulated by implicit race biases: higher implicit biases are associated with a significantly higher reliance on low SF with White than with Black faces.

T1  - Reaping More Than What They Sow: A Critical Race Perspective on Environmental Microaggressions Toward Latinx Farmworkers
AN  - 2434432884
AB  - There are 3+ million farmworkers in the 132.8-billion-dollar U.S. agricultural industry, most of whom are Latinx. Latinx farmworkers possess at least two marginalized identities, class and ethnicity, which expose them to prejudice and discrimination. Drawing from a critical race perspective, we proposed that prejudice and discrimination are experienced interpersonally and subtly embedded within the social and physical environments for Latinx farmworkers (i.e., environmental microaggressions (EMs)). Further, we hypothesized that farmworker-specific EMs would be associated with health. Data from 90 Latinx farmworkers (Mage = 46.09 years, 63.3% women) partly supported our hypotheses. Results revealed interesting patterns of association with depression and anxiety symptoms, and physical function. Findings underscore the need to examine classism and racism as intersecting systemic forces in the lives of Latinx farmworkers, some of the most vulnerable peoples within U.S. American society.

T1  - The Bidirectional Causal Relation Between Implicit Stereotypes and Implicit Prejudice
AN  - 2429520711
AB  - Although stereotypes and prejudice are commonly regarded as conceptually distinct but related constructs, previous research remains silent on the processes underlying their relation. Applying the balance-congruity principle to the concepts (a) group, (b) valence, and (c) attribute, we argue that the valence of attributes contained in a group-stereotype shapes evaluations of the group, while prejudice toward a group influences which attributes are stereotypically associated with the group. Using fictitious (Experiments 1 and 3) and real (Experiments 2 and 4) groups, the current studies demonstrate that (a) experimentally induced changes in the valence of semantic attributes associated with a group (stereotypes) influence implicit prejudice toward that group (Experiments 1 and 2), and (b) experimentally induced changes in the valence of a group (prejudice) influence implicit stereotyping of that group (Experiments 3 and 4). These findings demonstrate a bidirectional causal relation between prejudice and stereotypes.

T1  - The Legal Struggle of Gujarat Muslims to Access Pre-Matric Scholarships
AN  - 2490264532
AB  - Social and economic backwardness of Muslims in India in various fields, such as employment, education, housing and access to infrastructure, is well-documented, particularly in the Sachar Committee Report. Despite the constitutional promise of equality and non-discrimination, discrimination in various forms is the lived reality of Indian Muslims. Growing anti-Muslim prejudice in society and in the institutions of the State is responsible for Muslims' inability to realise their rights to equality and non-discrimination. Often there is a legal struggle to enforce constitutionally guaranteed rights and access benefits in welfare schemes. This article discusses the legal struggle to access the pre-matric scholarship under the Prime Minister's 15 Point Programme when the State of Gujarat refused to implement the scheme.

T1  - Mobility, familiarity and prejudice: living together in a multiethnic town in southern Laos
AN  - 2417139182
AB  - Research on coexistence and urban diversity (notably in the United Kingdom, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore) has demonstrated the ways individuals of diverse backgrounds routinely manage differences and interact meaningfully in multicultural societies, drawing on shared cultural knowledge and habits. This paper argues for a deeper exploration of societies where intercultural know-how is more limited and the capacity to negotiate difference has not been inculcated. This description fits several Southeast Asian societies wherein the politics of majority-minority is a dominant feature. This article investigates the possibilities of familiarity and friendship in a multiethnic town in southern Laos where the predominant ideology towards cultural diversity has been one of assimilation. In doing so, the paper reveals ways of creating a sense of belonging and community other than the practices of cultural accommodation. These processes draw on competences and dispositions which individuals have acquired through their mobility, producing a sense of togetherness, albeit contingent and fragmented.
