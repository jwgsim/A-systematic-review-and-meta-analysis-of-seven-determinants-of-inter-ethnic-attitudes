T1  - Minority Stress in Older Portuguese Gay and Bisexual Men and Its Impact on Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction
AN  - 2188816548
AB  - By 2050, the elderly population is expected to represent more than one third of the Portuguese population. Previous research demonstrated a significant increase of the LGB population in this age group, and that the needs of these individuals are not being addressed. Elderly LGB people, as both a sexual minority and an older age cohort, are particularly vulnerable to double stigma. The aim of this study was to evaluate how minority status of gay/bisexual men and its association with other psychosocial variables may affect sexual and relationship satisfaction. The sample was recruited online and composed of 110 gay/bisexual men aged 60 years or older (M = 63.5; SD = 3.41). Regression analyses showed that both the concealment of sexual identity in recent years and self-stigma significantly affected sexual and relationship satisfaction. In contrast, age-related discrimination was not associated with sexual satisfaction or relationship satisfaction. Gay and bisexual elderly men in this study tended to maintain their sexual identity hidden from others, possibly due to a lack of openness of the Portuguese society to accept homoaffective behavior. Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - Power, bureaucracy and cultural racism
AN  - 2401678485
AB  - This article critically engages with the voices of South Asian, Muslim women living in Rotherham to provide an emic gaze (Pike, 1967) of the intersectional lived experience of the ‘cultural others’. Everyday voices of South Asian, Muslim women activists living in the UK are marginalised based on prejudicial cultural assumptions. We demonstrate our challenge of negative discourses of the ‘passive and culturally oppressed female’. Our activism confronts racism predicated on cultural stereotypes embedded in state structures in contemporary Britain. This article explores the actions and tensions of confronting racism by South Asian, Muslim women living in Rotherham.

T1  - Signaling Similarity in the Icelandic Labour Market: How Can Immigrants Reduce Statistical Discrimination?
AN  - 2389722810
AB  - The authors discuss the reduction of statistical discrimination of immigrants. They look at the process of hiring immigrants from the point of view of human resource (HR) managers. Management literature has shown that HR managers face significant uncertainties when hiring which can, in turn, lead to statistical discrimination on their part. In this paper, they use qualitative interviews to examine how immigrants can reduce statistical discrimination in the Icelandic labour market by signalling their similarity to employers and divergence from their immigrant group.

T1  - The historical understanding of female premodern possessions. Problematizing some gender assumptions in the historiography on Teresa de Ávila and Jeanne des Anges
AN  - 2333552612
AB  - This paper discusses how to approach the history of female possessions today. By analyzing some recent contributions applied to two well-known historical figures: Teresa de Ávila (1515-1582) and Jeanne des Anges (1602-1665), I will problematize some of the ongoing history of female possessions. I intend a reflection on two of the current conceptual frameworks that feature the way history explains the subjective experience of these premodern possessed individuals. I focus on two kinds of interpretation: one I call the 'neurotic' interpretation, and the other the 'subversive' interpretation. Both constructions underpin explanations of women's divine and demonic possessions, involving historiographical gender prejudices and ahistorical assumptions.

T1  - Articulating language oppression: colonialism, coloniality and the erasure of Tibet's minority languages
AN  - 2316452528
AB  - Roche's article discusses 'language oppression' as a form of domination that is coherent with other forms of oppression along the lines of 'race', nation, colour and ethnicity. Scholars have defined language oppression as the 'enforcement of language loss by physical, mental, social and spiritual coercion'. It is part of an evolving suite of concepts from linguistics, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology that examines issues of language discrimination, or 'linguicism'. Roche explores one aspect of linguicism-language erasure-and how it relates to language oppression, focusing on Tibetans in the People's Republic of China (PRC). He examines how language oppression is produced through practices of erasure: the ways in which certain populations and their languages are systematically rendered discursively invisible. He argues that the erasure of certain languages in the Tibetan context is systematically reproduced by two otherwise opposed political projects: the colonial project of the PRC state; and the international Tibet movement that seeks to resist it. He refers to the contingent cooperation between these two opposed projects as 'articulated oppression'. In concluding the article he examines how the disarticulation of this oppression is a necessary condition for the emancipation of Tibet's minority languages, and discusses the broader significance of this study for understanding language oppression, and its relation to other forms of oppression.

T1  - Dehumanization of African-Americans Influences Racial Shooter Biases
AN  - 2287812314
AB  - Dehumanization, defined as the psychological process through which others are perceived as being non-human, has been of interest to researchers for many years, in part because of its potential to inform our understanding of how human beings justify harm toward out-groups. The current research extends the literature by using a novel experimental manipulation to investigate dehumanization’s effect on automatic behavior toward out-groups (e.g., racial shooter biases) and examined perceived threat as a moderator. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions (African-American dehumanization, white dehumanization, and control). Across two studies (Study 1, n = 290; Study 2, n = 318), those in the African-American dehumanization condition were quicker to correctly shoot armed African-American (vs. white) targets (d = − .21, 95% CI [− .38, − .04]) compared to the other two conditions. This effect was only significant among participants who perceived African-Americans as relatively more threatening.

T1  - Consent, Conjugality and Crime: Hegemonic Constructions of Rape Laws in India
AN  - 2287454836
AB  - ‘Promise to marry cases’ are those in which a victim is deceived into having sex with the defendant, based on a dishonest promise of marriage. Rape laws in India are designed to punish such defendants. These cases represent a significant proportion of rape cases in the legal system but remain under-researched. Drawing from postcolonial feminism and intersectionality theory, this article provides a socio-legal exposition of ‘promise to marry’ cases. This analysis is based on the total population of judgments in promise to marry cases, which were issued by Delhi trial courts from January to June in 2014 and 2016. It is found that courts propagate a heteronormative, intracaste, intracommunal construction of marriage while enforcing seemingly neutral rape laws. Given the prejudicial application of law, it is concluded that the use of criminal law in promise to marry cases is inappropriate.

T1  - Media portrayal of terrorism and Muslims: a content analysis of Turkey and France
AN  - 2220517830
AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue.

TT  - Quelle est la Durée des Chaînes de l'esclavage aux États-Unis? Estimations des effets Intergénérationnels pour les Hommes noirs entre 1880-1930 ¿Cuánto Duran las Cadenas de la Esclavitud en los Estados Unidos? Estimaciones de los Efectos Iintergeneracionales para Hombres Negros entre 1880-1930
AN  - 2471028601
AB  - Alors que l'esclavage négro-américain aux États-Unis a pris fin en 1865, l'inégalité raciale entre les descendants des esclaves noirs et les autres groupes raciaux, en particulier les Blancs, persiste. Bien que les explications des causes de cette inégalité soient nombreuses, la mesure dans laquelle elle est une conséquence de l'esclavage negre lui-meme est une question empirique relativement sous-explorée. Dans cet article, avec des données couplées sur les hommes et leurs peres dans le recensement américain de 1880 - 1930, je considere dans quelle mesure l'esclavage conditionne la mobilité économique et le statut des hommes dont les peres sont nés esclaves environ 65 ans apres l'émancipation des esclaves noirs . Mes estimations des parametres de l'élasticité de la mobilité économique et du statut du fils par rapport au statut d'esclave de leur pere suggerent que jusqu'en 1930, etre un descendant de sexe masculin d'un pere esclave noir avait de importance et était associé å une mobilité économique et un statut inférieurs. J'évalue également le taux de décroissance associé å l'effet intergénérationnel de l'esclavage et je trouve que les chaînes de l'esclavage sont assez longues, car å partir de 1930, il faudrait jusqu'å 175 ans environ pour que les effets de l'esclavage disparaissent completement. Les contrefactuels implicites de mes estimations fournissent un contexte et une base pour les reparations, car ils suggerent qu'en l'absence d'esclavage, la mobilité économique et le statut des descendants esclaves de sexe masculin auraient été plus élevés. La reduction du statut économique/de la mobilité résultant du fait d'etre le descendant d'un esclave masculin peut etre considérée comme le préjudice intergénérationnel «réparable» de l'esclavage des biens negres aux États-Unis.Alternate abstract:Mientras que la esclavitud de los negros en los Estados Unidos terminó en 1865, persiste la desigualdad racial entre los descendientes de los esclavos negros y otros grupos raciales, particularmente los blancos. Mientras las explicaciones de las causas de esta desigualdad son muchas, la medida en que es consecuencia de la esclavitud de los negros es una cuestión empírica que está relativamente poco explorada. En este artículo, con datos vinculados sobre hombres y sus padres en el Censo de los Estados Unidos de 1880-1930, considero hasta qué punto la esclavitud condicionó la movilidad económica y el estado de los hombres que tuvieron padres nacidos como esclavos aproximadamente 65 años después de la emancipación de los esclavos negros . Las estimaciones de mis parámetros sobre la elasticidad de la movilidad económica y el estado del hijo con respecto al estado de esclavo de su padre sugieren que hasta 1930, ser un descendiente negro de un padre esclavo negro importaba y se asociaba con una menor movilidad y estado económico.

T1  - Nation, nature, purity: extreme-right biodiversity in Germany
AN  - 2238519163
AB  - In this article, Forchtner investigates the construction of an 'ideal', extreme-right, ecologically sensitive subject. A concern for the natural environment is in no way new to the extreme right, and has long been part of its ideological make-up. In particular, claims that the laws of nature are applicable to the social world and that a community is embedded in an ecosystem have long been features of a right-wing ecological imaginary. Through an analysis of all the articles on a paradigmatic ecological issue, biodiversity, published in Germany's exemplary extreme-right magazine preoccupied with ecology, Umwelt & Aktiv (Environment & Active), this cultural imaginary is reconstructed. Included in it as key themes are human responsibility for environmental degradation, the ecological value of flora and fauna, and criticism of modernity's levelling tendencies (both biologically and culturally). Taking responsibility for the community's Heimat (homeland) is, consequently, a crucial element for this subject: a subject who aims for purity, order and the stability of ecosystems.

T1  - Abu Ykhiel to Guantanamo Bay and beyond: the paper trials of Omar Khadr 2002-2017
AN  - 2226215615
AB  - This research article critically analyses the photographs and illustrations that have been used to support arguments about Omar Khadr. Khadr was a 15-year-old who was captured by the US in Afghanistan, transferred to Guantanamo Bay where he was charged with murder and submitted to US interrogation. Throughout this process both supporters and opponents of Khadr have used pictures to support their claims. By examining and discussing these images it is possible to detect biases and prejudices that attempt to sway and influence the reader to the particular ideology of the writers. The article studies in depth images both for, and against, Khadr. It shows the different, printing and illustrating techniques that add menace to existing photographs, or soften the image for a more peaceful approach. In particular, it subjects the image of Khadr's damaged body being assisted by soldiers to a critical analysis to reveal what it really shows.

T1  - Promoting intergroup openness and support for equality in a new cultural context: Replicating the effects of internal criticism
AN  - 2224323171
AB  - Exposure to an outgroup member voicing criticism of his or her own group fosters greater openness to the outgroup's perspective. Research suggests that this effect owes its influence to a serial process in which participants' perception of the risk involved in voicing internal criticism leads to an increase in the perceived credibility of the speaker. The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality. Replicating past research, this effect is serially mediated by risk, credibility, and hope.

AB  - While chattel Negro slavery in the United States ended in 1865, racial inequality between the descendants of Negro slaves and other racial groups, particularly whites, persists.

Bien que les explications des causes de cette inégalité soient nombreuses, la mesure dans laquelle elle est une conséquence de l'esclavage nègre lui-même est une question empirique relativement sous-explorée. Dans cet article, avec des données couplées sur les hommes et leurs pères dans le recensement américain de 1880 - 1930, je considère dans quelle mesure l'esclavage conditionne la mobilité économique et le statut des hommes dont les pères sont nés esclaves environ 65 ans après l'émancipation des esclaves noirs . Mes estimations des paramètres de l'élasticité de la mobilité économique et du statut du fils par rapport au statut d'esclave de leur père suggèrent que jusqu'en 1930, être un descendant de sexe masculin d'un père esclave noir avait de l'importance et était associé à une mobilité économique et un statut inférieurs. J'évalue également le taux de décroissance associé à l'effet intergénérationnel de l'esclavage et je trouve que les chaînes de l'esclavage sont assez longues, car à partir de 1930, il faudrait jusqu'à 175 ans environ pour que les effets de l'esclavage disparaissent complètement. Les contrefactuels implicites de mes estimations fournissent un contexte et une base pour les réparations, car ils suggèrent qu'en l'absence d'esclavage, la mobilité économique et le statut des descendants esclaves de sexe masculin auraient été plus élevés. La réduction du statut économique/de la mobilité résultant du fait d'être le descendant d'un esclave masculin peut être considérée comme le préjudice intergénérationnel «réparable» de l'esclavage des biens nègres aux États-Unis.Alternate abstract:Mientras que la esclavitud de los negros en los Estados Unidos terminó en 1865, persiste la desigualdad racial entre los descendientes de los esclavos negros y otros grupos raciales, particularmente los blancos. Mientras las explicaciones de las causas de esta desigualdad son muchas, la medida en que es consecuencia de la esclavitud de los negros es una cuestión empírica que está relativamente poco explorada. En este artículo, con datos vinculados sobre hombres y sus padres en el Censo de los Estados Unidos de 1880-1930, considero hasta qué punto la esclavitud condicionó la movilidad económica y el estado de los hombres que tuvieron padres nacidos como esclavos aproximadamente 65 años después de la emancipación de los esclavos negros . Las estimaciones de mis parámetros sobre la elasticidad de la movilidad económica y el estado del hijo con respecto al estado de esclavo de su padre sugieren que hasta 1930, ser un descendiente negro de un padre esclavo negro importaba y se asociaba con una menor movilidad y estado económico. También calculo la tasa de descomposición asociada con el efecto intergeneracional de la esclavitud, y encuentro que las cadenas de la esclavitud son bastante largas, ya que a partir de 1930, llevaría aproximadamente 175 años, aproximadamente, para que los efectos de la esclavitud desaparezcan por completo.

T1  - Perceived causes of obesity, emotions, and attitudes about Discrimination Policy
AN  - 2210860943
AB  - Rationale Although obesity represents a potential public health crisis, our understanding of public perceptions of obesity, emotional responses to the obese, and related policy preferences is limited. Objective We employed Weiner's attribution theory of controllability (Weiner, 1988, 2011) to examine perceived causes of obesity, emotional responses, and related policy implications. If the perceived cause is controllable (eating and lifestyle habits), we expected less sympathy and greater anger toward obese people and support for prejudicial hiring policies based on weight. If the cause is perceived as uncontrollable (genetic), sympathy is anticipated as well as opposition to such hiring policies. Method We conducted multivariate analyses with data from two nationally representative surveys of U.S. adults. Conclusion Our findings supported the hypotheses, showing that sympathy and lack of anger toward obese people are strongly determined by a genetic attribution for obesity. Moreover, sympathy and the genetic attribution are significant predictors of opposition to hiring policies that discriminate against obese people. Finally, in a second study, chief among several causal attributions for obesity-lack of will power, lack of exercise, marketing of foods, and genetics-we discovered biological attribution functions as the key predictor of perceptions that obese people are frequent targets of discrimination. We suggest governments and the food industry should be more attuned to the underlying beliefs of the public about the causes of obesity when formulating programs and policies to address the issue.

AN  - 2187820600
AB  - David Livingstone's Second Expedition to Africa (1858 to 1863) began with lavish promises and expectations and ended ignominiously, with official Britons castigating the once greatly esteemed explorer of Africa. To what extent did Charles Livingstone, an ordained Congregational minister and David's American-trained younger brother, help to diminish the Expedition's successes? Were David Livingstone's promising exploring and scientific efforts compromised by his seemingly troubled, racist, brother? American-trained and an ordained minister, with a supposed 'ascendancy' over his elder brother, how did Charles' prejudices and actions undermine his brother's leadership and the accomplishments of the Zambezi project?

T1  - The Alexander memorandum
AN  - 2173648769
AB  - British officials knew a good deal about the upsurge in malignity following the terrible euphoria of the Anschluss in March 1938. Word even reached a British consul working under Sir Frederick Leith-Ross in China. Alexander made his way from the Far East to Germany, the place where he had spent contented days as a student, in order to negotiate the release of a Jewish friend from Dachau. Negotiations were progressing nicely until they were interrupted by the outburst of destructive fury against Germany's Jews in November 1938. As talks faltered in a febrile atmosphere of Jew-hatred, Alexander used his connections to gain access to a member of the Nazi aristocracy. The British diplomat got more than he bargained for. The senior Nazi made a shocking proposal. He outlined an incredible scheme that, he claimed, would lead to permanent peace between Germany and Britain. His plan uncannily presaged details of the Final Solution three years before its implementation. This information quickly made its way back to London and indeed to the British Foreign Secretary himself, Lord Halifax. So, how would the Foreign Office react? Wallis's article tells the story of a forgotten memorandum, one that challenges whether theories concerning the limits of the British imagination are sufficient to explain British inaction in the face of massive anti-Jewish persecution and violence.

T1  - Bad Is Stronger Than Good for Stigmatized, but Not Admired Outgroups: Meta-Analytical Tests of Intergroup Valence Asymmetry in Individual-to-Group Generalization Experiments
AN  - 2170272659
AB  - Theories of risk aversion, epistemic defense, and ingroup enhancement converge in predicting greater impact of negative (vs. positive) experiences with outgroup members on generalized evaluations of stigmatized outgroups. However, they diverge in predictions for admired outgroups. Past tests have focused on negative outgroups using correlational designs without a control group. Consequently, they have not distinguished between alternative explanations or ascertained the direction of causality/generalization, and they have suffered from self-selection biases. These limitations were redressed by a meta-analysis of experimental research on individual-to-group generalization with positive and negative outgroups (59 tests; 3,012 participants). Controlling for modest confounds, the meta-analysis found a generalization advantage of negative experiences for stigmatized outgroups and a generalization advantage of positive experiences for admired outgroups. These results highlight the centrality of valenced expectations about outgroups, consistent with epistemic defense and ingroup enhancement and inconsistent with risk aversion. Implications for positive changes in intergroup dynamics are discussed.

T1  - Jeitinho as a Coping Strategy Used by Brazilian International Students for Dealing with Acculturative Stress
AN  - 2287891166
AB  - This mixed-method study examined whether Brazilian students in the US use an indigenous problem-solving practice, jeitinho, as a coping strategy for acculturative stress. Forty-two participants answered an online survey, which was a culmination of demographic information, the Acculturative Stress Scale for International Students, BriefCOPE, jeitinho questionnaire, and three open-ended questions about how Americans may perceive jeitinho. Results showed that a negative dimension of jeitinho was associated with nonadaptive coping strategies, but it was not a significant predictor of acculturative stress. Qualitative themes highlighted the multidimensionality of jeitinho, which could help in students' adjustment (positive) or reinforce stereotypes and prejudices (negative) against Brazilians. Findings elucidate the complexity of jeitinho Brazilian students can be mindful about and when to use it to avoid stereotyping.

T1  - Disclosing Lesbian and Gay Male Sexual Orientation in Later Life: Attitudes of Younger and Older Generations in Eight Latin American Countries
AN  - 2266703691
AB  - The purpose of this research was to explore attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men disclosing their sexual preferences in eight Latin American countries. The sample consisted of 1,539 participants belonging to three age groups (18-29 years, 60-69 years, and 70 years and over). Their answers to two open-ended questions were content-analyzed, and binary logistic regressions were run on the extreme attitudinal categories. Results showed that although most attitudes were positive, a solid percentage of participants still expressed different kinds of derogatory attitudes. Men (as compared to women) and participants who were more religious and less educated tended to hold more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Both older samples were more prejudiced than the younger one, and attitudes also varied according to country. There was a general trend showing more positive attitudes toward older lesbians and gay men in those countries where sexual minorities' rights are better assured, which suggests that measures to protect sexual minorities and to make sexual diversity in older age visible could be advisable.

T1  - Narrating events and imputing those responsible: Reflexivity and the temporal basis of retrospective responsibility
AN  - 2158243886
AB  - By showing how a number of temporal assumptions shape three mutually exclusive narratives, the article argues for a mediated and reflexive understanding of events, one that is more open and less likely to fall into the pitfalls of a confrontation between different versions of retrospective responsibility. The article begins by looking beyond the agency and structure debate and into the temporal dimension of narrative, mainly for the sake of understanding the relationship between continuity and change. The article covers three potential narratives, focusing on their influence on the study of events, policy, and retrospective responsibility. It then illustrates their impact on mainstream understandings of the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014. Upon describing the problems of positing strict continuity and change, both of which impact accounts of retrospective responsibility, the outline of a more reflexive, mediated approach to events and temporality is introduced, based on Hans-Georg Gadamer’s hermeneutics. In doing so, the article demonstrates the disadvantages of Erlebnis, an approach that unreflexively applies a limited set of temporal assumptions, highlighting instead the advantages of Erfahrung, an approach that strives for a mediated understanding of events.

T1  - Shedding New Light on the Evaluation of Accented Speakers: Basic Mechanisms Behind Nonnative Listeners’ Evaluations of Nonnative Accented Job Candidates
AN  - 2154458989
AB  - The present research unites two emergent trends in the area of language attitudes: (a) research on perceptions of nonnative speakers by nonnative listeners and (b) the search for general, basic mechanisms underlying the evaluation of nonnative accented speakers. In three experiments featuring an employment situation, German participants listened to a presentation given in English by a German speaker with a strong versus native-like accent (in Studies 1–3) versus a native speaker of English (in Study 1). They evaluated candidates with a strong accent worse than candidates with a native(-like) pronunciation—even to the degree that the quality of arguments was of no relevance (Study 1). Study 2 introduces an effective intervention to reduce these discriminatory tendencies. Across studies, affect and competence emerged as major mediators of hirability evaluations. Study 3 further revealed sequential indirect influences, which advance our understanding of previous inconsistent findings regarding disfluency and warmth perceptions.

T1  - The Christian impact on the shaping of the First Republic of Korea, 1945-48: anti-communism or vision for a new nation?
AN  - 2135273606
AB  - Although Christianity was a new and small religion in Korea at the time, in 1945-48 Christian politicians and church leaders were prominent in establishing an independent South Korea as the Cold War began. Kang In-cheol and others argue that this was because Christians were prejudiced against communists and acted out of self-interest, and they hold them complicit in the subsequent Korean War. We shall argue that many Christian leaders were willing to work with communists to preserve the unity of the nation but their experience convinced them that communist aims were incompatible with religious freedom and with their own vision of a democratic nation founded on Christian principles. Our argument contributes not only to an understanding of Korean nationalism, but also to the broader literature on the roles of Christianity in democratisation. It reveals the significant influence of Christian actors at this critical juncture in Korean and world history, the impact of which is still being felt today.

AB  - This study investigates Americans’ attitudes toward the four major accents of South African English (SAfE) and several of their subvarieties in a hypothetical U.S. employment scenario. Participants perceived that SAfE accents possess positive language personality traits in comparison with standard American English; however, respondents identify SAfE speakers as foreign and perceive specific SAfE-accented varieties to be superior and more dynamic (e.g., General/Cultivated White SAfE and Indian SAfE) in relation to other SAfE-accented speakers (e.g., Mesolect Black SAfE and Cape Flats SAfE), even when they do not correctly identify the speaker’s country of origin.

T1  - Anatomy of Judicial Backlash: Southern Leaders, Massive Resistance, and the Supreme Court, 1954–1958
AN  - 2091009270
AB  - Exploiting a range of archival materials, we argue that state‐level variation in judicial backlash to Brown was as much the result of strategic choices by southern political elites as it was the ingrained prejudices of the region's white voters. Presenting case studies of massive resistance in Mississippi, Louisiana, Virginia, and Arkansas, we show that elite agency profoundly shaped the patchwork development of grassroots resistance to integration across the South. These findings challenge the prevailing view that backlash to Brown signaled the unequivocal triumph of racial conservatives. Rather, we argue that the region's response offered individual members of the southern elite significant autonomy to direct massive resistance in their home states. We also argue that southern lawmakers were responsible for the South's embrace of popular constitutionalism post‐Brown, and thus that it may not have been “popular” at all. We conclude that studies of judicial backlash would do well to reevaluate the assumption that backlash is necessarily a grassroots phenomenon.

T1  - For public (and recontextualized) sociology: The promises and perils of public engagement in an age of mediated communication
AN  - 2089865186
AB  - This article argues for the analysis of public engagement as an essentially mediated activity. Although recent studies note that academic knowledge is increasingly available for consumption by nonacademic audiences, they tell us little about how it gets recontextualized while passing through the hands of media professionals on its way toward such audiences. In Burawoy's (2005) influential call for the rebirth of public sociology, as in the debates his work provoked, the media is treated solely as a means for the transportation of knowledge. But as this article demonstrates, the media does not simply transport knowledge; it also, and at the same time, translates that knowledge in various, rhetorically consequential ways. Focusing on the mediated trajectory of an attempt by a group of academics to connect with audiences beyond academia, their initial contribution is compared to its subsequent translation(s) across various British newspapers. A discursive analysis reveals the techniques via which a classic form of public sociology came to be recontextualized such that, remarkably, these authors were left appearing to voice nothing but their own petty prejudices. The article concludes by noting that where public engagement involves mediation, public sociology should pay more attention to the recontextualizing affordances of media discourse.

T1  - The Co-Evolution of Education and Tolerance: Evidence from England
AN  - 2430651377
AB  - Using data from several periods of English history and building on the literature on culture and institutions, we analyze the co-evolution of education and attitudes toward women’s and minority rights. First, we establish a strong association between the size of twenty-first-century educational institutions in a given location and the attitudes prevalent there: the proximity of a large college or university is associated with individual support for women’s and minority rights, regardless of whether the individual has been to university. Second, we present evidence for high inter-temporal persistence in the geographical variation in the density of educational institutions over several centuries. Third, we show that the geographical distribution of later educational institutions depends not only on the distribution of medieval institutions, but also on correlates of medieval exposure to ethnic and religious diversity that are likely to have influenced attitudes. Institutions and culture co-evolve, and the inter-temporal persistence of the density of educational institutions is one mechanism (though probably not the only one) that explains the association between medieval exposure to diversity and twenty-first-century attitudes.

T1  - Noxious geopolitics, festering populaces and transmutable pasts: reframing the limits of acceptable politics through European refugee crises
AN  - 2031358306
AB  - Pavlovich's article sheds light on how recent interventions in Libya and Syria have facilitated a mass influx of Others in Europe (that is, refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers from the Middle East and Africa), thereby exacerbating already-existing frustrations and anxieties among local populations. This scenario is prompting many Europeans to look to their own collective pasts-through the prism of the present-where they find meaning in far-right, nationalist or populist narratives. These narratives are then used to legitimate political platforms that threaten the foundations of a multi-ethnic, multiracial and multiconfessional cosmopolitan society. Applying insights gleaned from ethnographic fieldwork in the Balkans, Pavlovich sheds light on how geopolitical manoeuvrings have sparked refugee crises, and subsequently impacted local politics across Europe. Ultimately, foreign intervention, refugee crises and the rise of right-leaning populism can be utilized as a heuristic prism to better understand the processes of social and political transformation in Europe. The lessons that can be learned import a sense of gravity in facing the future, given that the bounds and limits of international order and acceptable political action that were shaped in the post-Second World War era are becoming unhinged.

T1  - The Gendered and Commodified Female Body in Contemporary Nigerian Fiction
AN  - 2264150962
AB  - Although African feminist scholarship has grown diverse and dynamic over the years, it seems that little attention is paid to the discursive corporeality of the female body. It is often implied that discourses about the fate of the woman under a patriarchal system already caters for the body of the woman. There is however the need to stage or foreground the female body, by way of giving it much closer attention, its discursive formation, its use and abuse, its process of inscription, and its genderisation as it often fails to escape the exertions of patriarchy. Reading three contemporary Nigerian novels: Zaynab Alkali's The Descendants, Unoma Azuah's Sky-High Flames, and Lola Shoneyin's The Secret Lives of Baba Segi's Wives, this article examines the representation of the female body in fictional narratives with specific focus on how the body is gendered, sexualized and commodified. The article argues that in the process of inscribing gender and sexuality on the body and commodifying it, the question of body aesthetics is thrown up – the ironic privileging of the beautiful body, the place of the ugly body, the implications of the deformed body, and the entire artificial way of making the body what it is not. The article, after an analysis of the gendered and commodified female body in the novels mentioned above, concludes that the body is a victim of patriarchal and institutional power that inscribes positions and prejudices on it and gestures it towards what one may call self-inferioritisation, although the novelists offer hope of self-emancipation.Alternate abstract:Les études féministes africaines se sont diversifiées et dynamisées au fil des ans, mais il semble que peu d'attention ait été accordée à la corporalité discursive du corps féminin. Il est souvent sous-entendu que les discours sur le sort de la femme dans un système patriarcal prennent déjà en charge le corps de la femme. Il y a cependant nécessité de mise en scène ou de mise en avant, d'accorder beaucoup plus d'attention au corps féminin, à sa formation discursive, à son utilisation et aux mauvais traitements qui lui sont infligés, à son processus d'inscription et à sa sexo-spécification, car il n'échappe pas toujours au patriarcat. A travers trois romans nigérians contemporains: The Descendants de Zaynab Alkali, Sky-High Flames d'Unoma Azuah et The secret life of Baba Segi's wives de Lola Shoneyin, cet article examine la représentation du corps féminin dans des récits de fiction sur le corps sexo-spécifié, sexualisé et marchandise. L'article soutient que dans le processus d'inscription du genre et de la sexualité sur le corps et de sa marchandisation, la question de l'esthétique corporelle est soulevée – l'ironique mise en avant du beau corps, la place du corps laid, les implications du corps déformé, et tous les artifices utilisés pour faire du corps ce qu'il n'est pas. Larticle, après une analyse du corps féminin sexo-spécifié et transformé en marchandise dans les romans susmentionnés, conclut que le corps est victime d'un pouvoir patriarcal et institutionnel qui y inscrit des positions et des préjugés et le dirige vers ce que l'on pourrait appeler l'auto-infériorisation, quand bien même les romancières offrent des espoirs d'émancipation.

T1  - Trust in Police Motivations During Involuntary Encounters: An Examination of Young Gang Members of Colour
AN  - 1977601223
AB  - Problems related to distrust of police, including aggressive and prejudicial police behavior, continue to raise concerns. Using a procedural justice model, the present study examines perceptions of trust or the lack thereof among a subpopulation of young disadvantaged minority youth that routinely come in contact with the police: drug-dealing gang members. In this article, we examine 253 qualitative in-depth interviews comprised primarily of African American and Latino male and female drug-involved gang members, utilizing a comparative analysis, to examine how participants discuss interactions with law enforcement and describe situations where they trust the police or situations where they do not. The findings suggest that the context in which they were stopped operates as a primary differentiating component that shapes their perceptions of trust in the motivations behind police engagement. When stopped by the police for "justifiable" reasons, the participants expressed a trust in the motivations that necessitated the encounter. However, when stopped for reasons, which appeared as unreasonable, our participants voiced a strong sense of distrust in the motivations of the police. These findings suggest that procedural justice scholars should consider the extent to which the type or context of the encounter with the police plays an important role in influencing feelings of trust.

T1  - The blind spots of liberal citizenship and integration policy
AN  - 1973044763
AB  - Governments across Europe have stepped up their efforts to manage social diversity politically, often specifically targeting Muslim populations. Lewicki interrogates the policy tools that the British and German governments deploy to 'integrate' an increasingly stigmatized and racialized population, zooming in on whether and how they problematize patterns of inequality. Complicating the 'one country, one citizenship' rationale of the citizenship regime literature that assumes a one-dimensional interpretation of history, cultural identity, political institutions or legal norms, she points to four salient liberal citizenship discourses that currently frame policies of diversity management. These are civic republicanism, multiculturalism, civic universalism and cosmopolitanism. Her analysis demonstrates that all four liberal citizenship discourses have blind spots when it comes to problematizing structural hierarchies and the logics of racism. Over the last two decades, liberal citizenship and integration policy frameworks have thus contributed to the retention of binary distinctions between superior citizens and inferior Others, distinctions that can now easily be exacerbated and used for mobilization by right-wing populist movements.

AB  - The authors conducted a content analysis of 1,159 images of male models published on high-traffic gay male-oriented blogs. They focused on a range of body image-related variables, as well as the race of models. Results showed that most models were White and, almost uniformly, models had low levels of body fat. Models' level of muscularity varied significantly by race: Black models had the highest levels of muscularity, Asian models had the lowest levels of muscularity, and White and Latino models had moderate levels of muscularity. Drawing on existing research about race and body image, implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - The Effectiveness of Foreign Aid on Economic Development in Developing Countries: A Case of Zimbabwe (1980-2000)
AN  - 2110228601
AB  - This paper focused on the effectiveness of foreign aid in the developing countries with particular emphasis on Zimbabwe. The background of the paper is that, Zimbabwe as a developing country received and continues to accept foreign aid but is still underdeveloped. The investigation was based on a historical narrative of foreign aid in Zimbabwe between 1965 and 2000. It argued that the idea of granting and withholding of aid were and is still being used to influence the macro-economic policies of developing countries. This paper is essential largely due to the fact that many developing countries clamor for more foreign aid yet little economic growth is being achieved. The paper argues that foreign aid’s effectiveness can only be seen if people’s livelihoods are changed for the better. The paper discovered that, foreign aid was granted to the Zimbabwean government and it made tremendous contributions to the economy although it was largely tied to certain stipulations by donors which impacted negatively to its purpose resulting in the Zimbabwean government becoming dependent on foreign aid. The authors concluded that foreign aid is beneficial though its effectiveness is prejudiced by donor’s control.

T1  - Affective and Cognitive Orientations in Intergroup Perception
AN  - 1898548151
AB  - Three studies examined the role of need for affect (NFA) and need for cognition (NFC) in intergroup perception. We hypothesized that NFA predicts a preference for stereotypically warm groups over stereotypically cold groups, whereas NFC predicts a preference for stereotypically competent groups over stereotypically incompetent groups. Study 1 supported these hypotheses for attitudes toward stereotypically ambivalent groups, which are stereotyped as high on one of the trait dimensions (e.g., high warmth) and low on the other (e.g., low competence), but not for stereotypically univalent groups, which are seen as high or low on both dimensions. Studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations. Together, these findings help integrate and extend past evidence on attitude-relevant individual differences with research on intergroup perception.

T1  - Predicting punitive attitudes to sentencing: Does the public's perceptions of crime and Indigenous Australians matter?
AN  - 2425632921
AB  - In English-speaking western cultures the punitive attitudes towards law-breakers is well documented. The present study examines the utility of predictors of punitive attitudes with online survey data obtained from a convenience sample of 566 Australian residents. After controlling for demographic variables, the study examines the utility of two theoretical models; the Crime–distrust model and the Racial–animus model, in predicting punitive attitudes. All three factors of the Crime–distrust model significantly predict punitive attitudes. The study extends the current literature through identifying the significance of negative perceptions of Indigenous Australians in predicting punitive attitudes to sentencing. Results suggest that community perception of Indigenous Australians is a significant predictor of punitive attitudes in addition to factors of the Crime–distrust model. Future research using a more representative sample of the Australian population is recommended to increase the confidence with which findings are interpreted.

T1  - A century of victimhood: Antecedents and current impacts of perceived suffering in World War I across Europe
AN  - 1906667295
AB  - The present study addresses antecedents and consequences of collective victimhood in the context of World War I (WWI) across 15 European nations (N=2423 social science students). Using multilevel analysis, we find evidence that collective victimhood is still present a hundred years after the onset of the war and can be predicted by WWI-related objective indicators of victimization at national and family levels. This suggests that collective victimhood is partly grounded in the actual experience of WWI. In addition, we show that sense of collective victimhood positively predicts acknowledgment of the suffering inflicted by one's nation on other countries during WWI. This is consistent with a social representation of WWI as involving a vast massacre in which nations were both victim and perpetrator. Finally, we find that objective indicators of victimization predict pacifism in divergent ways, with an indicator at the national level associated with more pacifist attitudes and an indicator at the family level being associated with less pacifist attitudes. This finding suggests that war-torn societies may have developed social representations favouring peaceful coexistence whereas, at the family level, victimization may still foster retaliatory tendencies.

T1  - Pictorial stereotypes and images in the Euro debt crisis
AN  - 1862143832
AB  - In the Euro debt crisis, it is hardly surprising that reciprocal stereotyping is carrying the day in the national media reviving old images of the respective 'other'. The study asks how covers of German news magazines are shaped by the use of national stereotypes and images when reporting about this crisis. The paper seeks to build a bridge between the seemingly distanced disciplines arts and political science by offering a lean framework for analysis. It uses some cover images taken from two German weeklies and modifies Panofsky's semiotic model revealing traditional stereotypes and images of Greece.

T1  - Feeling the pulse of the Greek debt crisis: affect on the web of blame
AN  - 1862143791
AB  - This article examines the affective content of Greek media representations of the debt crisis, from 2009 to 2012. We analyze the content of opinion pieces from journalists, experts and public intellectuals published in Greek newspapers, and identify their affective tone towards political actors and institutions. We focus on anger, fear and hope, and identify blame attribution frames, which underpin the public's trust and confidence in domestic and European Union institutions. This article contributes to the systematic understanding of the impact of the debt crisis as a traumatic event on public opinion, and considers its implications for attitudes towards European integration.

T1  - A nation under attack: perceptions of enmity and victimhood in the context of the Greek crisis
AN  - 1862143310
AB  - The economic crisis signifies a turning point for Greek national self-image. The present paper explores the ideological function of interpretative repertoires in relation to the reproduction and contestation of national identity. We focus on two basic repertoires: a victimizing and a self-blaming one. Even though connotations of victimhood are not homogenous, its association with an external enemy is very popular. This paper demonstrates that discourses of victimization are not unambiguous and solidified; they interact with self-blaming discursive patterns, thus leading to hybrid perceptions of the national self-image that are adjusted to particular political actors' strategies.

T1  - 'Between a rock and a hard place': Bulgarian highly skilled migrants' experiences of external and internal stereotypes in the context of the European crisis
AN  - 1862142591
AB  - The intensification of intra-European migration has more recently coincided with the negative socio-economic consequences of the European economic crisis. The latter has revitalised dormant national stereotypes, employed into the scapegoating of migrants across Europe. Drawing on multi-sited ethnographic research, this article focuses on young, highly skilled Bulgarian migrants in the UK. Their experiences of internal and external national stereotypes are examined in detail. This article argues that this results in a process of double-sided othering, which has implications upon the identities of young skilled Bulgarians as they employ various strategies to make sense of their migratory choices.

T1  - The Southern Nicobar Islands as Imaginative Geographies
AN  - 1850015568
AB  - The southern Nicobar, an isolated archipelago in the eastern Indian Ocean, is the southern most territory of India. The Shompen and the Nicobarese were the sole inhabitants in the archipelago until the Government of India settled 330 ex-servicemen families in Great Nicobar. The ex-servicemen families, who came from an entirely different socio-cultural milieu of mainland India, perceived the cultural practices of the indigenes as odd and developed strong prejudices against them. This article juxtaposes two diametrically opposed discourses on the indigenous cultural practices--the settlers' and the indigenes'--and explores how the indigenes make sense of their cultural practices that the settlers find problematic. It also explores if such cultural practices hold any special significance for the isolated tribal communities that live in a fragile island ecosystem. The article elaborates its analyses against the backdrop of the issues that the indigenes have been facing due to the changes brought in their societies through external interventions.

T1  - Homosexuality and Pro-Gay Ideology as Pathogens? Implications of a Disease-Spread Lay Model for Understanding Anti-Gay Behaviors
AN  - 1827535789
AB  - Negative behaviors targeting gay men and lesbians range from violent physical assault to casting a vote against gay marriage, with very different implications for those targeted. Existing accounts of such actions, however, are unable to differentially predict specific anti-gay behaviors, leaving a large theoretical hole in the literature and hindering the design of effective interventions. We propose (a) that many sexually prejudiced laypersons conceptualize homosexuality and pro-gay ideology as "contaminants" analogous to infectious pathogens and (b) that anti-gay behaviors can thus be viewed as strategic attempts to prevent, contain, treat, or eradicate the "pathogens" of homosexuality and pro-gay ideology. By considering analogues to disease-spread processes (e.g., susceptibility of specific subpopulations, inoculation procedures, prevalence in the local environment, interconnections among community members), we derive novel predictions regarding the incidence and nature of anti-gay behaviors and provide leverage for creating more tailored interventions to reduce such discrimination.

AB  - The psychiatrists and health professionals who 'updated' the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 changed how 'autism' is meant to be interpreted. For example, Asperger's disorder merged into an overall collective of 'autism spectrum disorders', rendering Asperger's non-existent as a separate disorder. Yet the terms 'Asperger's', 'autistic' and 'autism', in general, are used on a daily basis by people who have been diagnosed/labelled in this way over the course of their lives, or indeed are used by people to label others in stereotypical and prejudicial ways that leads to their marginalisation. With this thought in mind, the author briefly reflects on his own experiences of being labelled with 'Asperger's' or as being 'autistic' (a label he rejects), whilst thinking from a 'dis/human' perspective, a viewpoint that seeks to unpack and challenge the dominant concepts of what it means to be human in the twenty-first century. While it is difficult to avoid being labelled in ways that lead to discrimination and rejection, a dishuman perspective offers a viewpoint against the narrow versions of what it means to be human, relating to how disability can trouble the notion of what it means to be human and indeed inform the very meaning of what it means to be human.

T1  - 'PRIMITIVE, CRUEL AND BLOOD-THIRSTY SAVAGES': STEREOTYPES IN AND ABOUT THE WESTERN BALKANS 1
AN  - 1841723051
AB  - This paper focuses on national stereotypes in the area of former Yugoslavia used by members of one ethnic community to describe members of other ethnic communities. The countries in the Balkans have a long history of ethnic fragmentation so it is no surprise that its ethnic groups are often stereotyped based on Western perceptions of the Balkans and the relationship between oppressors and the oppressed, which led to the development of stereotypes. The theoretical framework of stereotypes and prejudices and research on these topics show that stereotypes in former Yugoslavia have developed in relation to socio-political circumstances and that the stereotypes have been used for a long time, even after the potential reasons for their initial application ceased to exist.

T1  - Does imagery reduce stigma against depression? Testing the efficacy of imagined contact and perspective-taking
AN  - 1788507158
AB  - While the stigma surrounding mental illness has been well-established, less is known about methods for reducing that bias. In both laboratory (Study 1) and community (Study 2) samples, we tested the efficacy of imagined contact and perspective-taking for reducing stigma against depression. Participants first read a vignette about an individual with depression and then imagined either interacting with the individual (imagined contact), putting themselves in the individual's shoes (perspective-taking) or a neutral scene (control). In both samples, imagined contact was more effective in reducing stigma against depression than perspective-taking. The findings suggest that different prejudice reduction strategies should be used for different stigmatized groups.

T1  - Routine Activities and Perceived Homophobia Among Older Lesbians
AN  - 1758097720
AB  - Research on experiences of perceived homophobia among the older lesbian population has been limited. Using data from a national, online survey of 456 lesbians over the age of 51, the authors explore the correlates of perceived homophobia using a routine activities approach. Potential correlates explored include both risk and protective factors experienced in the daily lives of the women surveyed. The findings indicate that risk and protective factors affect personal and systemic homophobia differently. Risk factors such as being "out" to family were related to all forms of homophobia, while protective factors seem to impact systemic and personal homophobia differently. Findings suggest a need for further research examining potential protective factors for older lesbians.

AN  - 1888938759
AB  - La présente étude axée sur le thème « L’embouteillage dans les grandes villes de l’Afrique de l’Ouest et ses problèmes: cas de Cotonou au Bénin » a pour objectif d’étudier les causes et les conséquences économiques et socio-environnementales de la congestion au niveau des grandes artères de la capitale administrative du Bénin surtout aux heures de pointe. Et pour y parvenir, la collecte des données a été effectuée à travers la recherche documentaire, l’observation directe et participative, l’entretien et l’enquête de terrain. Après le traitement des données, l’analyse des résultats est réalisée suivant le modèle PEIR (Pression, Etat, Impacts, Réponse). En effet, de ces différents résultats, il résulte que la concentration des services administratifs dans la ville de Cotonou, l’exode rural, la défection du réseau routier et la prolifération des engins à deux roues dans ce milieu d’étude constituent les principales causes de l’embouteillage communément appelé « Go Slow » avec pour pôle principal, le carrefour d’Akossombo. Cette situation occasionne de graves préjudices non seulement à l’environnement mais également aux populations du Bénin. Au nombre de ces nuisances, figurent entre autres, la perte de temps et par ricochet d’importantes recettes financières sans oublier la baisse du Produit Intérieur Brut (PIB) pour l’Etat béninois ainsi que pour les entreprises et les sociétés. A toute cette vague de conséquences, s’ajoutent la pollution atmosphérique et sonore, le développement persistant de certaines pathologies comme les céphalées, les infections respiratoires aiguës, le cancer des poumons, le stress, etc. Enfin, pour réduire un tant soit peu les différents problèmes relatifs à ce phénomène dans la ville de Cotonou au sud du Bénin, il importe que les autorités à divers niveaux pensent à la construction de nouvelles infrastructures routières, la délocalisation des services administratifs, des entreprises et sociétés vers des villes secondaires, la subvention des véhicules neufs, la création et l’encouragement du transport en commun, etc.Alternate abstract:This study focused on ""The congestion in the major cities of West Africa and its problems: Case Cotonou in Benin"aims to study the causes and socio-economic and environmental consequences of the congestion at the major arteries of the administrative capital of Benin especially during peak hours. And to achieve this, the data collection was conducted through desk research, direct and participatory observation, interview and field survey. After data processing, analysis of results is carried out following the PEIR model (Pressure, State, Impact, Response). Indeed, these different results, it follows that the concentration of administrative services in the city of Cotonou, the rural exodus, the defection of the road network and the proliferation of twowheeled vehicles in this study environment are the main causes bottling commonly called "Go Slow" with the main pole, the crossroads Akossombo. This situation causes serious harm not only the environment but also to the people of Benin. Among these nuisances, include among others the loss of time and in turn significant financial revenue not to mention the decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the State of Benin and for companies and societies. A whole wave of consequences, add air and noise pollution, the continuing development of certain diseases such as headaches, acute respiratory infections, lung cancer, stress, etc. Finally, to reduce a little bit different problems related to this phenomenon in the city of Cotonou in southern Benin, it is important that the authorities at various levels think about the construction of new road infrastructure, outsourcing of administrative services, businesses and companies to secondary cities, the grant of new vehicles, the creation and promotion of public transportation, etc.

T1  - Attachment security and intergroup contact
AN  - 1727469495
AB  - The contact hypothesis suggests that the interaction between members of different groups decreases prejudice. Moderators and mediators shaping this link have been investigated. However, research about the factors that facilitate contact is not frequent. This article examines secure attachment as an antecedent of contact. Three studies provide information about various aspects of the relationship between secure attachment and contact: security is positively associated with (a) intergroup contact, which in turn is related to reduced prejudice (Study 1); (b) implicit approach tendencies toward the outgroup (Study 2); and, once again, (c) with contact through the indirect effect of openness to exploration (Study 3). In the discussion, we recommend priming both secure and insecure schemas to investigate their unique effects on intergroup contact.

T1  - Do Politically Non-conservative Whites "Bend Over Backwards" to Show Preferences for Black Politicians?
AN  - 1700928334
AB  - The current study examined whether politically non-conservative (i.e., liberal and moderate) Whites demonstrate an explicit bias in favor of Black versus White politicians on measures of political support and whether these assessments are influenced by implicit racial bias against Blacks. To address this, 671 non-conservative Whites were presented with political speeches paired with a photograph of either a Black or a White politician implied to have given the speech and were then asked to read the speech and evaluate the politician on a number of dimensions. Results showed that participants rated Black politicians more favorably than White politicians on measures of political support, including a willingness to vote for, donate money to, and report confidence in the politician. Importantly, the favorability bias observed on these measures was not influenced by implicit racial biases. When evaluating Black politicians' intelligence, however, an explicit favorability bias (higher overall ratings of Black compared to White politicians) was moderated by implicit racial bias. Implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias was associated with lower ratings of perceived intelligence of Black politicians, but not White politicians, such that the favorability bias was effectively eliminated for intelligence ratings. Our findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that although White non-conservatives may go out of their way to demonstrate outward support for Blacks, deep-rooted negative attitudes about Blacks may remain, which can potentially undermine true support for Blacks in politics.

T1  - Challenging Race-Based Stereotypes about Gay and Bisexual Men's Sexual Behavior and Perceived Penis Size and Size Satisfaction
AN  - 1698327333
AB  - Racial prejudice and stereotyping in gay and bisexual communities may be important contextual factors that contribute to racial disparities in HIV. In an effort to challenge race-based stereotypes regarding gay and bisexual men's sexuality, we sought to determine the extent to which race and ethnicity were associated with (1) racial homophily (i.e., same-race partnerships), (2) sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, condomless anal sex (CAS), sexual position (top/versatile/bottom)), and (3) perceived penis size and size satisfaction. Data were taken from a survey of 1,009 gay and bisexual men recruited using a street-intercept method at gay, lesbian, and bisexual community events in NYC in 2006--15 % Black, 61 % White, 18 % Latino, and 6 % Asian/Pacific Islander (mean age, 35.7). There was strong evidence of racial homophily (i.e., having a partner of the same race) among men who were in relationships, particularly for White and Black men. Race and ethnicity was largely unassociated with multiple dimensions of sexual behavior (e.g., number of partners, CAS, sexual positioning). Although we observed some racial and ethnic differences in perceived penis size that were consistent with stereotypes, the magnitudes of the differences were insufficient to justify the stereotype. As well, there were no significant differences with regard to satisfaction with penis size or lying to others about penis size. The disproportionate HIV prevalence among Black and Latino men does not appear to be as a result of differences in sexual behavior (e.g., CAS, number of partners) and race-based sexual stereotypes were largely unsupported by empirical data.

T1  - Intervening in the Media's Influence on Stereotypes of Race and Ethnicity: The Role of Media Literacy Education
AN  - 1708527329; 201528954
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Intervening in the Media's Influence on Stereotypes of Race and Ethnicity: The Role of Media Literacy Education
AN  - 1662632097
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Biases in the Perception of Barack Obama's Skin Tone
AN  - 1640528037
AB  - White Americans higher in prejudice were less likely to vote for Barack Obama than other Americans. Recent research also demonstrated that supporters and opponents of Mr. Obama engaged in skin tone biases, i.e., they perceive Mr. Obama's skin tone as lighter or darker in line with more positive or negative views of him. Across two studies we hypothesized that skin tone biases occur as a function of two independent sources: racial prejudice, which is always related to skin tone bias, and political partisanship, which is related to skin tone bias primarily during elections. Study 1 assessed perceptions of Mr. Obama's skin tone shortly before and after the 2008 Presidential election, and shortly after the first inauguration. Study 2 assessed perceptions in the middle of his first term, immediately prior to the 2012 Presidential election, and 1 year into his second term in office. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that partisan skin tone bias was limited to the election period, whereas prejudice-based skin tone biases occurred independent from any election.

T1  - Reflecting on Heterosexual and Male Privilege: Interventions to Raise Awareness
AN  - 1634405107
AB  - Gender-focused college courses seek to increase understanding of the systematic advantages associated with dominant group membership. These courses attempt to reduce prejudice and raise awareness of male and heterosexual privilege. Inclusion of privilege content within gender-focused courses has increased, but research to test interventions to increase privilege awareness and reduce prejudice remains sparse. The current studies provide experimental information about awareness of heterosexual privilege (Study 1) and male privilege (Study 2) and specific interventions for use in education, professional development, and community settings. Study 1 found the video intervention was effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Study 2 found that male privilege awareness was significantly increased and modern sexism was reduced by the video intervention. Findings provide information for applied practices such as pedagogical strategies when designing diversity courses and training workshops.

T1  - Confronting and Reducing Sexism: A Call for Research on Intervention
AN  - 1634405014
AB  - This article presents the current state of research on confronting and reducing sexism. We first provide a systematic overview about prior work on confronting sexism. We identify gaps in the literature by outlining situational and contextual factors that are important in confronting sexism and introduce how these are addressed in the current volume. Second, we review prior work on reducing sexism. Compared to research on reducing other forms of prejudice, research on interventions to reduce sexism is rare. We explain why mechanisms that are successful in reducing other forms of prejudice cannot simply be adapted to reducing sexism. We then outline how the articles of this issue promote research, theory, and policy on reducing sexism. In conclusion, the aim of this issue is to bring together novel theoretical approaches as well as empirically tested methods that identify key antecedents and consequences of diverse ways of confronting and reducing sexism.

T1  - Racial Wage Disparity in US Cities
AN  - 1616080961
AB  - This paper estimates the conditional wage gaps between black and white full-time male workers at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level using data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses. The magnitudes of the wage gaps are found to vary substantially across location. As predicted in Becker's (The economics of discrimination, University of Chicago Press, Chicago,  1957 ) seminal theory on wage discrimination, we find that the wage gaps are greater in MSAs that have a larger proportion of black workers in the labor force. This is the most consistent result across all specifications and years. We also find the gaps to be greater where there is an overrepresented black population in jail and a more segregated population if the MSA is in the South. The proportion of workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement in the private sector is associated with greater relative black earnings. We find that although the relationship between race and wages has diminished over time as famously suggested in Wilson (The declining significance of race: Blacks and changing American institutions, University of Chicago Press, Chicago,  1978 ), the significance of race remains.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Solzhenitsyn and the February 1917 Revolution
AN  - 1681107823
AB  - Maslov discusses the Revolution of February 1917. Enough time has passed to attempt to look at their history and the people who made it without prejudice and not from the viewpoint of present-day mentality. They do not intend, reading the polemics between Cicero and Marcus Antonius, to judge from the vantage point of modem ideology what is better, dictatorship or democracy. And of course one should not lay blame on historical figures of the past from the positions of modem morality or politics. Solzhenitsyn also quotes these words of Prince Lvov. But he "delves still deeper into our history." He begins his search for the culprits who triggered the February Revolution from afar and, tike Pushkin's Yevgeny in The Bronze Horseman, blames everything on Peter the Great. According to Solzhenitsyn, Tsar Peter 1 "trampled under, foot the soul of the people" and "erected his somber creation in the north-western corner of our land."

T1  - Tolerance and the Politics of Identity in the European Union
AN  - 1544201846
AB  - Objectives              The basic research problem in this article is whether hostility toward out-groups is a product of events or whether the degree of hostility toward out-groups exists independently of such events in the form of a generalized bigotry.              Methods              We examine two countries that experienced threatening violent events from an unassimilated minority in order to determine if their levels of intolerance increased in the period between two runs of the World Values Survey when these violent events occurred. This article also examines six additional EU countries that did not experience such violent events.              Results              In the six countries that did not experience violent events, the level of tolerance increased between the two waves of the World Values Survey while tolerance decreased in the two countries that experienced violent events.              Conclusions              The strongest factor in fostering intolerance toward out-groups is a perception of a violent, existential threat to one's way of life. Our analyses tentatively suggest the following factor may exacerbate levels of intolerance: the presence and strength of a nativist or populist party of identity mobilizing a rejection of out-groups.

T1  - 'Black Horror on the Rhine': Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War
AN  - 1767327855; 201605092
AB  - In the aftermath of the First World War, a storm of protest met the stationing of colonial African troops in the occupied German territories. The campaign, spearheaded by legendary Congo reformer Edmund Dene Morel, influenced a broad spectrum of leftists, feminists, anti-imperialists, and pacifists in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. In the United States and Canada the mainstream labour movement-the American Federation of Labor in the United States and its Canadian affiliate the Trades and Labour Congress-generally did not respond to Morel's appeal. In contrast, idealistic leftists, feminists, anti-imperialists, and peace activists-men and women most committed to the creation of a world without war, racial prejudice, and gender inequality-took up Morel's anti-imperialist and blatantly racist campaign. This article seeks to explain how this seeming contradiction came to be. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RACE OF ATHLETE-SPOKESPERSON AND IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT RESPONSES TO ADVERTISING
AN  - 1534013475
AB  - In this study, the authors investigated racial vs. athletes from other countries, bias and differences in attitude of South Koreans toward advertisements featuring Korean vs. foreign athletes and White vs. Black athletes by implementing explicit and implicit measures. The results suggest that Koreans have implicit preferences for Korean athletes over foreign athletes; implicit attitudes that are more favorable toward advertisements featuring Korean athletes than toward those featuring foreign athlete-spokespersons; implicit preferences for White athletes over Black athletes; and implicit attitudes that are more favorable toward advertisements featuring White athlete-spokespersons than toward those featuring Black athlete-spokespersons. The explicit measures revealed several contradictory results; therefore, the authors have discussed implications for the discrepancy between implicit and explicit measurement methods and the usefulness of implicit measures in the context of racial bias research.

T1  - Relationships Between Religion and Intolerance Towards Muslims and Immigrants in Europe: A Multilevel Analysis
AN  - 1962748563
AB  - This paper examines relationships between religiosity and intolerance towards Muslims and immigrants among Europeans living in non-Muslim majority countries by applying multilevel modeling to European Values Study data (wave four, 2010). Thus relationships across 44 national contexts are analyzed. The analysis found large between-country differences in the overall levels of intolerance towards immigrants and Muslims. Eastern Europeans tend to be more intolerant than Western Europeans. In most countries Muslims are less accepted than immigrants,—a finding which reflects that in post-9/11 Europe Islamophobia is prevalent and many still see Muslims with suspicion. A key result is that believing matters for the citizen’s attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants. Across Europe, traditional and modern fuzzy beliefs in a Higher Being are strongly negatively related to intolerance towards immigrants and Muslims, while fundamentalism is positively related to both targets of intolerance. Religious practice and denominational belonging on the other hand matter far less for the citizen’s propensity to dislike the two out-groups. With the only exception of non-devout Protestants who do not practice their religion, members of religious denominations are not more intolerant than non-members. The findings are valid for the vast majority of countries although countries differ in the magnitude of the effects.

T1  - Islamophobia, Euro-Islam, Islamism, and Post-Islamism: Changing Patterns of Secularism in Europe
AN  - 2189986102
AB  - Modern secularism, as theorized by such prominent liberal philosophers as John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas, prescribes that the state should treat all religions equally on the condition that they and their adherents relinquish their theocratic aspirations and recognize the political sovereignty and superiority of man-made law. Convinced that the secular bargain undermines the moral virtue of society and its members, a small, fragmented, but nevertheless conspicuous number of Islamists in Europe prefer to observe Islamic law in all walks of life, private and public. Alarmed by Islamists and informed by Orientalist readings of Islam, an increasingly vehement and vociferous contingent of Islamophobes avers that Islam is inherently incompatible with democracy and urges European governments to treat neither Islam nor Muslims equally, but rather suspiciously as real or potential threats to the wellbeing of European societies. In contrast, advocates of EuroIslam insist that Islam can be reformed, like Christianity, to meet the requirements of modern secularism. This article contends that elements of all three of these vying ideological positions have found their way into policymaking targeting Muslims in several European lands. The resulting inconsistency and contradiction - what I call policy "messiness" - corroborate the process of "mutual fragilization" theorized by Charles Taylor, in which actors facing radical value pluralism develop solicitude regarding their own principles as well as greater tolerance for ambivalence. The latter, in particular, creates what Homi Bhabha terms a "third space" from which actors confronting cultural pluralism can freely and constructively explore cross-fertilizations and hybrid combinations with the potential to yield yet unimagined approaches and solutions to the problems of "super-diversity." I identify just such a creative hybridity among a younger generation of European Muslims whom many observers dub "post-Islamists."

T1  - THE EFFECT OF PERSPECTIVE TAKING ON NEGATIVE COGNITIVE RESPONSES INDUCED BY INTERGROUP THREAT
AN  - 1507593130
AB  - In two related studies, the authors explored the influence of perspective taking on the moderation of negative cognitive responses induced by intergroup threat. In Study 1, they recruited undergraduate students at Southwest University who came from rural areas in China. Participants were randomly assigned to either a threat condition group or a control group. They presented to all participants a policy advantageous to urban students and measured their level of opposition. Participants in the threat condition were more opposed to the policy than were the participants in the control condition. In Study 2, the authors manipulated perspective taking and again measured the level of opposition of a group of students from rural areas to a policy advantageous to urban students. Participants in the perspective-taking condition were less opposed to the policy than were those in the control condition. In summary, perspective taking positively influenced the moderation of negative cognitive responses induced by intergroup threat.

T1  - Housing among Persons of International Protection in the Slovak Republic
AN  - 1547935755
AB  - The present study2 analyses the conditions and housing opportunities for Persons of Concern (PoCs) to the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees), specifically refugees and persons who have been granted subsidiary protection in Slovakia. This study follows recent pilot studies conducted in Poland and Hungary, which examine the risks of homelessness for PoCs. However, the scope of this paper is wider and deals with issues of housing more thoroughly. The analysis includes risk assessment and the impact of housing policies and legislation is assessed and key issues are identified. It is also the first comprehensive analysis of housing issues among PoCs in Slovakia. Since 2010 the provision of their basic needs were passed from the state to an NGO which became the main service provider of their accommodation. Lack of education and an insufficient knowledge of Slovak language supported by stereotypes and prejudices of employers and the majority to foreigners (especially from Africa and Arab countries) greatly reduce their chances to find a job and support an adequate housing.

T1  - Disambiguating discriminatory acts of typical versus atypical perpetrators: the moderating role of need for cognitive closure
AN  - 1433108665
AB  - Three studies tested the interaction of the prototype effect, the notion that ambiguous behavior is more likely to be perceived as discriminatory when the executor is prototypical; and the need for cognitive closure, the tendency to seize on an answer. Study 1 provided bolstering evidence of the prototype effect's moderation by need for cognitive closure. Ambiguously sexist behavior enacted by a prototypical (male) executor was perceived as more discriminatory than the same behavior exhibited by a nonprototypical (female) executor, and this effect was exacerbated by higher trait levels of need for cognitive closure. In Studies 2 and 3, via situational induction, prototype reliance again was exacerbated, such that it overrode the influence of individual-difference levels of need for cognitive closure.

T1  - Discrimination between the rich and the poor under contrasting conditions of wealth stratification
AN  - 1433108663
AB  - Using minimal group procedures, 2 studies investigated money allocations made by rich/poor group members in wealth stratifications based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit. Study 1 participants were assigned to rich or poor groups based on a coin toss (group-chance) or on performance of each group on a test (group-merit). Study 2 participants completed a test ostensibly distinguishing between high/low effortful individuals. High-effort individuals were assigned to the rich group, low-effort individuals were assigned to the poor group (individual-merit). After personally receiving play money, participants distributed their money to the rich and the poor. Results show that wealth based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit yielded contrasting patterns of parity and discriminatory behaviors.

T1  - Psychopathy and machiavellianism predict differences in racially motivated attitudes and their affiliations
AN  - 1433108475
AB  - Different forms of racism and racist groups should be differentially attractive to politically motivated members of the Dark Triad. Study 1 showed that high levels of both Machiavellianism and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) predicted modern racism, whereas high levels of psychopathy and RWA predicted old-fashioned racism. In Study 2, those high in Machiavellianism and RWA wanted to join a traditional Ku Klux Klan (KKK) group, emphasizing nonviolence and political strategies. However, those high in psychopathy and RWA wanted to join a violent, Neo-Nazi militia group. The studies highlight differences between Machiavellianism and psychopathy in expression of antisocial tendencies and dispositions. In addition, when combined with RWA endorsement, these traits can lead to the support of destructive organizations.

T1  - The measurement of mistrust among religious group members in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1433108461
AB  - Cultural mistrust is a protective mechanism employed by minority group members when risk of victimization from majority group members is high. In Northern Ireland, depending on the context, both Catholics and Protestants may perceive themselves at risk of discrimination, and use similar protective strategies. This study examined the appropriateness of the Cultural Mistrust Inventory in assessing mistrust among members of different religious groups within Northern Ireland. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses resulted in an 11-item, 3-factor measure of religious mistrust. Mistrust appears to be experienced by both Catholics and Protestants, regardless of group status; with males reporting significantly higher levels of mistrust of the "other" group. Higher levels of mistrust were associated with higher psychological distress.

T1  - Which name unlocks the door? The effect of tenant race/ethnicity on landlord response
AN  - 1433108402
AB  - Two Internet experiments investigated how the race/ethnicity and gender of prospective tenants impacted landlord response. Among males, Asian American tenants fared best, receiving 45.2% positive responses. Hispanic and White tenants received a similar number of positive responses (34.7% and 34.0%, respectively), while the African American tenant received the fewest (16.0%). In general, female prospective tenants received more positive responses than did male prospective tenants (40.8% vs. 27.1%); among females, White and Asian American women received more positive responses (67.3% and 60.8%, respectively) than did Hispanic (43.1%) and African American (41.2%) women. The experiments indicated that prospective tenants were more likely to receive positive responses when their race matched that of the neighborhood in which the apartment is located.

T1  - Does policy name matter? The effect of framing on the evaluations of African American applicants
AN  - 1433108401
AB  - Affirmative action continues to be one of the most contentious policies in the U.S. The current study examined the effect of hiring policy framing on the evaluation of African American applicants. Participants (N=204) reviewed the résumé of an African American man either hired under an affirmative-action or a diversity-initiative frame. Results indicated that the applicant was evaluated as more competent under the diversity-initiative frame than the affirmative-action frame. This was especially true for White and conservative raters. The findings suggest that shifting to an emphasis on diversity instead of affirmative action may decrease negative attitudes toward affirmative-action beneficiaries.

T1  - Reconciliation responses, blame, and expressions of guilt or shame
AN  - 1433108393
AB  - Recipients of intergroup apologies have been found to prefer expressions of shame over guilt. However, there is little research comparing the responses of a wronged group with those of a blamed group. Kenyans/Britons evaluated guilt/shame statements about colonialism, with blame measured as the assignment of collective guilt to Britain. Among Britons, there was a significant interaction, with high in-group blamers expecting more reconciliation from shame than from guilt, and vice versa for low in-group blamers. Among Kenyans, there was no main effect of blame, but more reconciliation was expected from shame than from guilt. Wronged groups thus appear to prefer shame over guilt, whereas preference for guilt/shame among members of a blamed group depends on the level of in-group blame.

T1  - To confront or not to confront: non-targets' evaluations of and responses to racist comments
AN  - 1433108370
AB  - The current studies explore situational and individual factors affecting non-target perceivers' reactions and behavior following a racist comment, focusing on verbal confronting behavior. Two studies were conducted in which participants reported about recent situations in which they witnessed a racist comment that was not directed specifically at their own racial group. Results indicated that only one third of participants directly confronted the commenter. Strength of verbal confrontation was predicted by affective reactions and judgments of the offensiveness of the prejudicial comment. Analyses also revealed that strength of confrontation for females was predicted by the experience of negative emotions, but that males confronted more with stronger ratings of the offensiveness of the racist remarks. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

T1  - White ancestry in perceptions of Black/White biracial individuals: implications for affirmative-action contexts
AN  - 1433108333
AB  - The present studies examine how White ancestry influences perceivers' minority categorization of Black/White biracial individuals, as well as the implications of minority categorization for distribution of minority resources and stereotype use. Study 1 suggests that people are less likely to categorize those of Black/White biracial descent as minority and thus are less likely to view them as appropriate recipients of affirmative action than those of Black monoracial or Black/Native American descent. Study 2 tests a model in which Black/White biracial individuals with a greater amount of White ancestry are perceived as experiencing less discrimination and are less likely to be categorized as minority; therefore, they are judged as less appropriate for minority resources.

T1  - The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1433108267
AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

T1  - Natural law and critical theory: Bringing rights back in
AN  - 1933647427
AB  - This paper re-assesses the significance of the idea of 'right' in the tradition of critical theory. Focusing on the work of Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno, especially their confrontation with totalitarianism, it addresses their conceptualization of rights, their engagement with the philosophies of right created by Kant and Hegel, and the ambivalent place of Marx in their thinking about rights. My argument is that critical theory turned to natural rights in response to the perceived difficulties positive sociology had in confronting the barbarities of fascism and Stalinism. Critical theory steered a path between philosophies of right that acknowledged the idea of right within an unacceptably naturalistic frame of reference, and a sociological consciousness that de-natured the idea of right at the cost of its devaluation. Arendt and Adorno both confronted the contradictions of an age in which the rights of the individual were elevated as a supreme value while individuality was subjected to the forces of technological and economic determination. Both understood the barbarism of their times in terms of the disintegration of mediations between freedom and determination. Both recognized the gulf that separates the concept of rights from the material interests, inequalities and prejudices concealed behind them. And both drew on the critical substance of natural right theory to distinguish between the critique of rights, which has as its end their revaluation , and the trashing of rights, which serves to reinforce their devaluation . I argue that there is much to be gained, in terms of our understanding both of rights and of critique, from critical theory's engagement with the natural law tradition.

T1  - The senior discount: biases against older career changers
AN  - 1433107847
AB  - This study examined age discrimination in between- vs. within-career job transitions. We expected that older workers transitioning into a new field would experience greater age discrimination than those who change jobs within the same field, particularly when amount of prior job experience is not made salient, and particularly when decision-makers were highly prejudiced. Results suggested that younger job applicants received higher suitability ratings than older job applicants, and job applicants making a within-career transition were rated higher than those making a between-career transition. As hypothesized, older job applicants making between-career transitions would receive the lowest ratings of suitability for hire when no information regarding experience was presented, and when decision-makers were highly prejudiced. Implications for the aging workforce are discussed.

T1  - Using Intergroup Contact Theory to Reduce Stigma Against Transgender Individuals: Impact of a Transgender Speaker Panel Presentation
AN  - 1433106934
AB  - Sexual minorities experience significant stigma and prejudice. Much research has examined sexual stigma and prejudice impacting gay and lesbian individuals, but limited research has examined other sexual minorities, such as transgender persons or individuals whose gender identity or expression is incongruent with their assigned gender or anatomical sex. Research has found that interpersonal contact with sexual minorities is associated with lower sexual stigma and prejudice. Intergroup contact theory predicts that interaction between groups can reduce stereotyping and improve intergroup relationships. Using a randomized crossover design, this study compared the impact of exposure to a transgender speaker panel vs. a traditional transgender lecture presentation on transphobia. Results indicated greater immediate reductions of transphobia following the transgender speaker panel than traditional lecture.

T1  - Glasswing Butterflies: Gay Professional Football Players and Their Culture
AN  - 1905838891
AB  - Only one association football (soccer) player in history has declared his homosexuality during his professional active playing career. Before or since that player's death in 1998, no other professional footballer player has come out. The prohibitively traditional culture of association football is popularly regarded as being responsible for this. Fans habitually use homophobic epithets to abuse players. In recent years, England's governing organizations have cautiously addressed this state of affairs, though ineffectually. The present study uses online methods to explore fans' and industry professionals' perspectives on gay players and the impact their failure to come out has had on the sport. The article, which is based on the responses of 3,500 participants, seeks to answer three questions: (1) Why do fans, who urge gay players to come out, use homophobic language to barrack players? (2) If gay players disclosed their sexual orientations publicly what effect would this have on them personally, on football culture generally and on conceptions of masculinity in sports? (3) What prevents gay football players coming out? The overwhelming majority (93%) of participants in the study oppose homophobia and explained the homophobic abuse as good-humored banter or, in their argot, "stick." An unusual logic is employed to make this intelligible. Participants argue that an athlete's ability to play football is the only criterion on which he is judged and his sexuality is of little consequence to their evaluations. Although few participants encourage forcible outing, the majority welcome openly gay players, whose impact would be transformative. Football clubs and agents are cited as the principal impediments to a more open and enlightened environment: participants argue that they pressure gay players to keep their sexuality hidden and so contribute to a culture of secrecy, which permits and perhaps commissions continued homophobic abuse. Participants speculate that the continued absence of openly gay players actually reproduces the apparent prejudices. One fan concludes, "The homophobia in football will remain for longer if no gay players come out."

T1  - The Role of Attitudes in Reactions Toward Diversity in Workgroups
AN  - 1545060969
AB  - The present study examined attitudes toward diversity as a moderator of outcomes of diversity in workgroups. Two studies were conducted that focused on the development of the Attitudes Toward Diverse Workgroups Scale (ADWS) and on the impact of diversity attitudes on task performance and psychological reactions in actual face-to-face diverse brainstorming groups. The first study supported the internal consistency and stability of the ADWS and revealed that it was related, in the predicted way, to the Big Five and general prejudice. The second study revealed that high scores on the productive and affective dimensions of the ADWS enhanced brainstorming performance (quality of ideas) in actual diverse groups and positive psychological reactions to the group experiences, respectively.

T1  - What's in a Name? The Effects of the Labels "Fat" Versus "Overweight" on Weight Bias
AN  - 1545064598
AB  - This research examined the effects of the labels "fat" vs. "overweight" in the expression of weight bias, with the prediction that the label "fat" biases individuals to respond more negatively than does the label "overweight." In Study 1, participants' attitudes toward people labeled as fat were less favorable than were their attitudes toward people labeled as overweight. In Studies 2 and 3, although participants chose similar-sized figures to depict fat and overweight targets, weight stereotypes and weight attitudes were more negative toward people labeled as fat than those labeled as overweight. In addition, the endorsement of weight stereotypes mediated the biasing effect of the "fat" label on weight prejudice. Implications of this work for prejudice researchers and for public attitudes are discussed.

T1  - THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF PRIOR CRIMES EVIDENCE AND OTHER MYTHS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS
AN  - 867687005
AB  - This Article argues that there is very good reason to believe that the misshapen stone should indeed be extracted and that the result would be a considerably less grotesque structure. There is abundant empirical evidence that prior criminal convictions weigh heavily in jurors' decisions about acquittal and conviction. That same empirical work suggests that jurors' learning directly through the evidence that defendant has been convicted of prior crimes makes very little difference to conviction rates. This seeming paradox is examined in considerable detail. Understanding how and why it arises suggests that the tendency in American law to suppress information about prior crimes (except under special circumstances) is a self-defeating strategy that not only lacks a convincing epistemic foundation but may also be responsible for the inadvertent conviction of innocent defendants. Arguably, it is often not the admission of prior crimes evidence that is unfairly prejudicial so much as its exclusion. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Welcoming dogs: Levinas and 'the animal' question
AN  - 1928321624
AB  - According to Levinas, the history of western philosophy has routinely 'assimilated every Other into the Same'. More concretely stated, philosophers have neglected the ethical significance of other human beings in their vulnerable, embodied singularity. What is striking about Levinas' recasting of ethics as 'first philosophy' is his own relative disregard for non-human animals. In this article I will do two interrelated things: (1) situate Levinas' (at least partial) exclusion of the non-human animal in the context of his markedly bleak conception of 'the state of nature', and (2) drawing on Orwell, Wittgenstein and Gaita, argue that, despite his more positive evaluation of animality (specifically a dog named Bobby), Levinas is guided by a number of anthropomorphic prejudices; not least that the epithet 'the animal' can be used in the general singular.

T1  - Survivalism and Public Opinion on Criminality: A Cross-National Analysis of Prostitution
AN  - 754040730; 201050385
AB  - Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism & racial prejudice. In contrast, this article hypothesizes that public opinion is linked to the strength of a general cultural axis of nations: survivalism vs. self-expressionism. Data are from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Hierarchical modeling techniques are used to sort out the bi-level effects of survivalist culture on the approval of prostitution. Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index. Unlike previous investigations, which relied on specific symbolic orientations, the present results suggest that attitudes about criminality are linked to a generalized cultural axis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial discrimination and health: A systematic review of scales with a focus on their psychometric properties
AN  - 743049702; 201029642
AB  - The literature addressing the use of the race variable to study causes of racial inequities in health is characterized by a dense discussion on the pitfalls in interpreting statistical associations as causal relationships. In contrast, fewer studies have addressed the use of racial discrimination scales to estimate discrimination effects on health, and none of them provided a thorough assessment of the scales' psychometric properties. Our aim was to systematically review self-reported racial discrimination scales to describe their development processes and to provide a synthesis of their psychometric properties. A computer-based search in PubMed, LILACS, PsycInfo, Scielo, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted without any type of restriction, using search queries containing free and controlled vocabulary. After initially identifying 3060 references, 24 scales were included in the review. Despite the fact that discrimination stands as topic of international relevance, 23 (96%) scales were developed within the United States. Most studies (67%, N = 16) were published in the last 12 years, documenting initial attempts at scale development, with a dearth of investigations on scale refinements or cross-cultural adaptations. Psychometric properties were acceptable; sixteen of all scales presented reliability scores above 0.7, 19 out of 20 instruments confirmed at least 75% of all previously stated hypotheses regarding the constructs under consideration, and conceptual dimensional structure was supported by means of any type of factor analysis in 17 of 21 scales. However, independent researchers, apart from the original scale developers, have rarely examined such scales. The use of racial terminology and how it may influence self-reported experiences of discrimination has not yet been thoroughly examined. The need to consider other types of unfair treatment as concurrently important health-damaging exposures, and the idea of a universal instrument which would permit cross- cultural adaptations, should be discussed among researchers in this emerging field of inquiry.

T1  - Muslim Discrimination: Evidence From Two Lost-Letter Experiments
AN  - 1866473440
AB  - Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there has been considerable concern about whether Muslims living in Western countries are targets of prejudice. A considerable amount of survey-based evidence suggests that Muslims are victims of discrimination. This paper tested this hypothesis. Two lost-letter experiments were conducted to test whether the difference in returned letters would be attributable to whether the addressee was Muslim or Swedish. The results show that Muslims receive far fewer letters than do Swedes. However, this discrimination only appears when the lost letters contain money; in which case, the finder gains by not posting the letter.
