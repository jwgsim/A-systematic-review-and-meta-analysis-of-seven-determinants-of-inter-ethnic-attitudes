T1  - Studying Friendship in Housing the MIT School of Architecture at MIT in the Postwar Years
AN  - 2699692910
AB  - The architect Burnham Kelly hired social scientist Leon Festinger to analyze friendship among residents living in veteran housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1946. Festinger accomplished this by linking friendship to mundane social events—such as neighbors chatting in common courtyards—and he attributed these events to the subtle but meaningful ways that architecture organized people in space. In studying social relations between neighbors, Festinger wondered if class or racial attitudes played a role in whether or not tenants became friends. Festinger framed his housing study in apolitical terms, but his research provided a methodological framework for later analyses of desegregated public housing that had major political consequences. These studies of racially integrated housing found their way into the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education, where they provided evidence for the plaintiff’s claim that desegregation could be accomplished peacefully.

T1  - Social integration of people with a migration background in Swiss sport clubs: A cross-level analysis
AN  - 2652518403
AB  - Sport clubs are considered an ideal setting for the social integration of people with a migration background. However, they can also be a place of social closure practices, where assimilative ideas and ethnic boundaries are present. Besides the individual characteristics of the members, adequate club organizational structures are relevant for preventing social closure and facilitating social integration. Thus, the role of organizational structures for social integration might differ between natives and people with a migration background. Based on data from 42 Swiss sport clubs and 780 sport club members, with and without a migration background, we analyzed individual (migration background and membership biography) and structural factors (situational, club goals, and club culture) using multilevel models and tested cross-level interactions between structural variables and migration background. The results reveal that membership biography (e.g. membership duration and volunteering) and migration background are relevant for social integration. The estimated cross-level effects reveal that, unlike for natives and second-generation people with a migration background, structural conditions are especially relevant for first-generation people with a migration background. For example, social integration increases with a higher proportion of people with a migration background in the club or a less assimilative club culture.

T1  - In search of a religion: the making of Dalit-Identity in Jammu and Kashmir, India
AN  - 2678584657
AB  - The Dalits in Poonch, a borderland district situated along the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir, belong to the multi-religious Pahari-ethnic-group. The partition of the Indian subcontinent in 1947 affected the community and displaced them across the cease-fire line – the boundary that bisected the erstwhile Poonch fiefdom and has since then stood as the de facto disputed border. Their displacement to the Poonch on the Indian side added another layer of marginality to an already stigmatised community (also referred to as Harijans/Bhangis) as the processes of their rehabilitation failed to rise above the narratives of exclusion and discrimination in a post-partition scenario. For the Dalits of Poonch, the journey has been different from the Dalits who have been subjected to oppression and exclusion elsewhere in India. The ethnic-Dalits in quest of ‘a religious identity’ where they can exist as an equal, have belonged within three different religious folds. Through an ethnographic inquiry, the research while exploring the lived experiences of Dalits here also looks at keeping in mind the role of partition and religion in the evolution of identities here. Besides the changing inter-community interactions between the Dalit community and dominant-caste groups in Poonch, the research analysis layers of marginality by looking at how one exists as a Dalit, living between and with multiple identities: religious identities, the larger Pahari-ethnic-identity, both of them at crossroads with the identity of being a borderlander, dwelling in a zone of conflict and dispute.

T1  - Immigration and the sociocultural divide in Central and Eastern Europe: Stasis or evolution?
AN  - 2647921729
AB  - Immigration has historically been of low salience in Central and Eastern Europe. Yet, the region has consistently higher levels of ethnocentrism than the rest of Europe. Scholars argue that the East's limited politicization of immigration is due to its status as a region of emigration and the presence of ethnic minority ‘others’. I argue that this is changing. The politicization of the European refugee crisis by domestic elites has begun to refocus the sociocultural dimension on the immigration issue. Using structural equation models, I compare European Values Study data from 2008 and 2017 across 10 East European EU member states. I find evidence that traditionalist attitudes are more strongly related to anti‐immigration attitudes since the crisis, particularly for those who are interested in politics. Further, immigration attitudes are polarizing across the GAL‐TAN dimension and by education. Hence, immigration is bolstering a pre‐existing, socially structured divide around both nationalist and traditionalist values.

T1  - A Panel Study of Attitudes toward Ethnic Minorities and the Role of Changes in Individuals’ Economic Situations
AN  - 2649170228
AB  - This study applies the dynamic perspective of realistic conflict theory to assess whether and the extent that individuals’ negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities changed and were linked to changes in individuals’ economic situations. Employing Dutch panel data, we found that negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities were remarkably stable. Differences in attitudes toward ethnic minorities were more pronounced between individuals than within individuals. The small changes that did occur over the 10-year study period were hardly explained by economic characteristics. Only increased individual dissatisfaction with the national financial situation was associated with more negative attitudes. These results cast doubt on whether attitudes toward ethnic minorities are susceptible to change and raise questions about realistic conflict theory’s relevance in explaining attitudinal change.

T1  - Using a social marketing approach to develop a pro-diversity intervention
AN  - 2600347126
AB  - PurposeDespite more than half a century of academic research, relatively few methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in the real world. This paper aims to use a social marketing approach to design a pro-diversity intervention in a university setting.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted extensive qualitative, quantitative and observational background research to identify elements that would increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Focus groups and surveys allowed us to identify a target audience, target behaviors and the relevant barriers and benefits.FindingsThe background research suggested increasing inclusive behavior would have a greater impact than reducing discriminatory behavior. Based on this research, this paper determined an optimal target audience was students who had relatively positive attitudes toward diversity but engaged in few inclusive behaviors. This paper used relevant theories from the behavioral sciences to design an intervention that promoted a small set of inclusive behaviors and that addressed the relevant barriers and benefits. The intervention took the form of a single page of targeted messages that instructors can add to their course syllabi. The page communicates injunctive and descriptive norms, highlights the benefits of behaving inclusively and provides concrete behavioral advice.Originality/valueThe research applies the social marketing approach to a novel domain. This approach represents a new way to advance diversity, equity and inclusion through promoting inclusive and reducing discriminatory behavior.

T1  - COVID-19 and the Political Framing of China, Nationalism, and Borders in the U.S. and South Korean News Media
AN  - 2585804470
AB  - Using an inductive framing analysis of news coverage, we examine how the most popular liberal and conservative news media in the United States and South Korea mobilize different nationalist narratives on China in responding to social, economic, and political upheavals during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We identify three major areas of political cleavage in both Korean and U.S. media discourse on nationalist identities vis-à-vis the construction of the national or racialized “Other.” This includes (1) imagined solidarity against China as an adversary; (2) political disputes over boundary-making; (3) and the construction of ethnonational belonging and exclusion. Our research underscores how intrastate and interstate shifts during periods of crisis can heighten political cleavages along racial and ethnic fault lines and complicate dominant frameworks of civic and ethnic nationalism in both countries.

T1  - "The mind may go, but the heart knows": Emotional care by ethnic minority carers of people living with dementia
AN  - 2586552578
AB  - Drawing on the sociology of emotions, this article investigates the socially and culturally mediated nature of emotions and emotional care within 93 ethnic minority carers' narratives of dementia care. Adding to the cross-cultural literatures on the sociology of emotions and dementia care respectively, our analysis showed that 'signals' of dementia to family carers were often emotional outbursts of anger by the person with dementia. These displays, in turn, created conflict, and aroused emotions such as shame, anger, and depression among carers. To mitigate these tendencies, carers enacted emotional management, which centered on reducing the gravity of negative emotions felt by the person with dementia, and affording them the social space to maintain a positive disposition. To create this positive emotional space, carers deployed different strategies. Some mobilized medical discourses to diffuse the emotional and moral significance of their relative's behavior and enable emotional distantiation. Others conceived of people with dementia as 'childlike' and requiring their protection from emotional negativity. Although, such efforts work took a toll on carers' emotional energies, it was considered enabling, therapeutic, and integral to care. Such emotional work departs from academic and advocacy efforts that see such behavior as patronizing and infantilizing, and underscores the need for more nuanced discussion around emotions and dementia care in ethnic minority families.

T1  - Social Exclusion Among Official Language Minority Older Adults: A Rapid Review of the Literature in Canada, Finland and Wales
AN  - 2569488143
AB  - It has been suggested that older adults from minority linguistic and ethnic communities face higher risks of being socially excluded. The aim of this review was, therefore, to explore and review social exclusion studies conducted among official language minority older adults in three countries, namely Canada, Finland and Wales. A rapid review approach was used to review scientific literature in line with six social exclusion domains. The literature searches were made in Finnish, Swedish, English, French and Welsh and were restricted to research published within the timeline of 2001 – September 2019 and yielded 42 articles. The included studies were categorized into three different domains: socioeconomic influences, social participation and societal conditions. Converging and diverging patterns of social exclusion in old age were identified between the linguistic minorities. Linguistic barriers regarding access to health care and receiving health information were common across the three linguistic contexts, whereas exclusion from social participation was noticed amongst the linguistic minorities in Canada and Wales. Some connections between belonging to a linguistic minority and being exposed to a lower socioeconomic status and higher poverty risk were made, however, these findings were not robust across all three countries. The findings indicated that experiences of exclusion could be considered fairly common among linguistic minority older adults. We conclude that the research evidence presented in the review sheds light on issues of social inequality in old age between linguistic majorities and minorities, thus identifying important aspects of social exclusion to guide future research as well as policy and practice.

T1  - African and Indigenous games and activities: a pilot study on their legitimacy and complexity in Brazilian physical education teaching
AN  - 2557933183
AB  - Although the teaching of African-Brazilian and Indigenous history and culture is mandatory in primary and secondary schools, there has been a lack of proper contextualizing in PETE programs [Corsino, L. N., & Conceição, W. L. (Eds.). (2016). Educação física escolar e relações étnico-raciais: Subsídios para a implementação das leis 10.639-03 e 11.645-08 [School physical education and ethnic-racial relations: Subsidies for the implementation of laws 10.639-03 and 11.645-08]. CRV, v. 11]. There is also a need to study how the recognition of African-Brazilian and Indigenous ethnic-racial issues in primary and secondary physical education is mandated by the law. The purpose of this research – framed as a pilot study – is to address the invisibility of African-Brazilian and Indigenous history and culture in schools. The objective is to analyze both the teachers’ knowledge and the law application in physical education classes concerning African and Indigenous games and activities. We have addressed the invisibility of Black and Indigenous people in Brazil, connections to the African diasporas and Indigenous cultures, ethnic-racial inequalities in physical education, and the African-Brazilian and Indigenous complexities as challenges for PETE. The research method is qualitatively oriented and descriptive. Data was generated from an online questionnaire responded to by physical education teachers who work in primary schools. Findings suggest that there is a lack of discussion on ethnic-racial issues in PETE or in permanent teacher education programs. Despite the law, there is a discrepancy in its application in Brazilian education. Physical education opens space to reflect upon the African-Brazilian and Indigenous cultures in the schools. Even teachers who do not teach ethnic-racial issues at their schools affirm the importance to teach. In conclusion, it is necessary to decolonize the curriculum, emphasizing the ethnic-racial complexity in PETE. Transform pedagogies and prompt the construction of new paths for social justice practices do require a more culturally diverse physical education curriculum.

T1  - COVID‐19, nationalism, and the politics of crisis: A scholarly exchange
AN  - 2478233459
AB  - In this article, several scholars of nationalism discuss the potential for the COVID‐19 pandemic to impact the development of nationalism and world politics. To structure the discussion, the contributors respond to three questions: (1) how should we understand the relationship between nationalism and COVID‐19; (2) will COVID‐19 fuel ethnic and nationalist conflict; and (3) will COVID‐19 reinforce or erode the nation‐state in the long run? The contributors formulated their responses to these questions near to the outset of the pandemic, amid intense uncertainty. This made it acutely difficult, if not impossible, to make predictions. Nevertheless, it was felt that a historically and theoretically informed discussion would shed light on the types of political processes that could be triggered by the COVID‐19 pandemic. In doing so, the aim is to help orient researchers and policy‐makers as they grapple with what has rapidly become the most urgent issue of our times.

T1  - Extending a Hand in Perilous Times: Beneficial Immigration Policy in the Fifty States, 2005–2012
AN  - 2455185247
AB  - ObjectiveThe passage of Arizona SB 1070 in 2010 focused national attention on punitive, state‐level immigration legislation. Largely ignored is the increasing number of beneficial, state‐level policies passed during the same period. We seek to understand whether beneficial immigration policy making amounts to reversing the factors underlying punitive immigration policy making, as is implied by current literature.MethodsWe utilize data from the National Conference of State Legislatures from 2005 to 2012 to uncover the puzzling enactment of beneficial state immigration laws during a period of high anti‐immigrant sentiment and budgetary declines in the 50 states.ResultsBeneficial immigration policy making is not a reversal of the process that underlines punitive immigration policy making and is particularly responsive to the need generated by immigrant population size, regardless of the documentation status of the beneficiary.ConclusionThe passage of beneficial immigration policies requires further analysis, as it is not as simple as reversing the process that produces punitive immigration policies.

T1  - Mali’s peace networks: the role of Islamic religious leaders in conflict resolution
AN  - 2421220092
AB  - The article highlights the involvement of Muslim leaders in Mali’s conflict resolution process from January 2012 to the French intervention the following year. Built upon extensive fieldwork conducted throughout 2017, it discusses the mechanisms at play as religious mediators seek cooperation amongst three separate fault lines of potential conflict: between the state and the people, between ethnic communities, and amongst rival armed groups. Indeed, while most discussion of the role of Islam in Mali has focused on the jihadist strains threatening to tear the country apart from the North, our central conclusion is that it is in fact the more moderate, locally embedded religious forces that are partly responsible for holding the country together. Their ability to act across these three interfaces is derived from their organic ties to, and moral legitimacy with, a cross cutting matrix of ethnic and social groups that often find themselves in conflict with each other, yet nonetheless mutually acknowledge the moral power of Islam, and its local authorities, to set the terms of social interaction.

T1  - "Light-skinned people always win": An Autoethnography of Colorism in a Mother–Daughter Relationship
AN  - 2491989775
AB  - Meghan Burke defines colorism as "the allocation of privilege and disadvantage according to the lightness or darkness of one's skin" (International Encyclopedia of the Social Social Sciences, 2nd ed.). The intraracial practice can be heightened in familial interactions. This collaborative autoethnography utilizes Alice Walker's framework of womanism to explore the narratives of colorism in a mother-daughter relationship when the two do not share the same skin hue. Womanism instructs us to break our silence around practices that denigrate us and seek ways to survive and thrive in our blackness. Four specific incidents experienced by my adolescent daughter are shared to critique colorism and consider strategies for navigating this practice and sustaining a mother-daughter relationship.

T1  - A large-scale test of the link between intergroup contact and support for social change
AN  - 2391206105
AB  - Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size—and at times, direction—of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change—willingness to work in solidarity— that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.Using data from 69 countries, Hässler et al. show that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups, but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Being Friends with or Rejected by Classmates: Aggression Toward Same- and Cross-Ethnic Peers
AN  - 2375654156
AB  - Whereas previous research suggests that adolescents’ aggressive behavior in itself does not highlight ethnic boundaries, it remains unclear whether classmates’ responses to same- and cross-ethnic aggression strengthen ethnic boundaries. This study examined how adolescents’ aggression toward same- and cross-ethnic peers relates to the positive (friendship) and negative (rejection) relationship nominations they receive from same- and cross-ethnic classmates. Cross-sectional peer nomination data on 917 Dutch and 125 Turkish adolescents in 56 secondary schools were analyzed (mean age = 14.9 year; 51.4% boys). Adolescents received more friendship nominations from same-ethnic than from cross-ethnic classmates, but were not more rejected by cross-ethnic than same-ethnic classmates. Multilevel Poisson and negative binomial regression models showed that, irrespective of aggressor’s ethnic background, adolescents’ aggressive behavior was related to rejection by classmates from the ethnic group that was the target of aggression and to being befriended by classmates from the ethnic group that was not the target of aggression. Specifically, both Dutch and Turkish adolescents who were aggressive toward Dutch peers were rejected by Dutch classmates and befriended by Turkish classmates and vice versa. These findings suggest that classmates’ positive and negative responses to adolescents are related to adolescents’ aggressive behavior based on the ethnic background of the victim, not on the ethnic background of the aggressor. This suggests that integration between ethnic groups in schools relates to aggression in general, not only cross-ethnic aggression.

T1  - The Easter Sunday Bombings and the Crisis Facing Sri Lanka’s Muslims
AN  - 2352015769
AB  - This paper primarily examines the Easter Sunday bombing plotted and executed by a group of Sri Lankan Muslims and post-war Sri Lankan conditions among Sri Lankan Muslims, also known as Moors. The article will attempt to argue that (a) the post-war violence and organized Islamophobia among non-Muslim communities in general and the Sinhalese in particular increased fears and distrust among Sri Lankan Muslims in general; and (b) state concessions to Muslim political leaders, who supported successive Sri Lankan ruling classes from independence through the defeat of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, have meant an isolation of the community from the other two main ethnic communities. The concessions that the Muslim community has won actively helped the Muslim community to be proactive in its religious practices and thus paved the way for exclusive social and political choices. The rise of Islamic movements and mosques in the post-1977 period galvanized Muslims. In time this isolation has been reinforced by socio-religious revival among Muslims whose ethnic identity has been constructed along the lines of the Islamic faith by Muslim elites. Despite this revival it has been clear that the Muslim community has been reluctant to use Islamic traditions and principles for peace building, which could have helped to ease tensions, brought about by the 30-year-old ethnic conflict. Finally, some pragmatic ways to ease tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in the greater discipline of conflict resolution are explored using traditions within Islam.

T1  - Notes on the complexity of neoconservatism and its impact on social policies
AN  - 2460599145
AB  - It is impossible to discuss neoconservatism without highlighting its importance in the current Brazilian economic, political and cultural context. It is worth stating that the intensity and pace of neoconservative manifestations further involve social workers in the task of analysis, critical positioning and intervention in social relations. The effort to think about them must always be plural and complex. Neoconservatism is deeply related to neoliberalism and the need to build a conservative morality in the present moment of capitalism. There are multiple incidents that operate in the construction of this conservative morality and of a docile “new man”. In Brazilian specificity, the rise to power of the extreme right is analyzed as an expression of neoconservatism and its simultaneous manifestations in gender, ethnic-racial relations and in the field of sexual rights and its search for hegemony. Understanding it is a sine qua non condition to overcome economic analysis of the contemporary Brazilian scene.

T1  - How Cross-Cutting Discussion Shapes Support for Ethnic Politics: Evidence from an Experiment in Lebanon
AN  - 2356703659
AB  - It is widely believed that ethnic politics and conflict are less pronounced in countries with cross-cutting rather than reinforcing social cleavages. We argue that one possible explanation is that cross-cutting cleavages facilitate cross-cutting social interaction among individuals from different ethnic and/or class groups. This article examines whether such cross-cutting interaction, relative to homogeneous interaction, can reduce support for ethnic politics and increase support for a cross-ethnic, programmatic alternative. We conduct an experiment in Lebanon in which 720 lower- and upper-class Christians, Sunnis, and Shia were randomly assigned to participate in discussions that varied in their sectarian and class compositions. Our evidence suggests that cross-sectarian discussion resulted in less support for sectarian politics but only when individuals also belonged to the same economic class, driven by greater learning about shared preferences and reduced coethnic social pressure. We also demonstrate the limitations of other forms of cross-cutting discussion, showing that interaction among coethnics or non-coethnics from different classes did not weaken support for ethnic politics. These findings reveal when and how interaction that leverages a second dimension of interest or identity can help shift political preferences, shedding new light on the foundations of support for cross-ethnic politics in ethnically divided societies.

T1  - Corruption, patronage and illiberal peace: forging political settlement in post-conflict Kyrgyzstan
AN  - 2328366385
AB  - This article engages critically with recent literature on political settlements through a case study of inter-ethnic conflict in southern Kyrgyzstan. The case study traces how a new political settlement emerged in the aftermath of conflict, despite a rejection of international proposals on conflict resolution. Instead, local elites constructed an exclusionary form of social order, forged through dispossession and violence, maintained by informal institutions of patronage and clientage. The article explains why this new political settlement appeared remarkably resilient, despite its failure to address traditional liberal concerns regarding transitional justice and minority grievances. The case study highlights two major problems with the political settlements literature. First, it contests a widespread conceptualisation of political settlements as indicating a cessation of conflict, instead pointing to how a political settlement can be initiated and maintained through different forms of violence. Second, it questions notions of inclusivity in political settlements, noting that many political settlements combine logics of both inclusion and exclusion. In many cases, they are marked by exclusionary, authoritarian practices that together constitute a form of 'illiberal peace'. These findings caution against a simplistic use of political settlements theory to inform policies aimed at resolving internal conflicts.

T1  - The value of reproduction: multiple livelihoods, cultural labor, and immigrants in Iowa and North Carolina
AN  - 2316331910
AB  - In the US South and Midwest, early immigrant populations consisted primarily of young, Latinos recruited to work in low-wage jobs. After six or seven years, family members from Mexico and Central America began joining early arrivals, changing the character of immigrant interactions with host residents and institutions. While many natives viewed the single men as migrant workers, important for economic services, the arrival of women and children stimulated ambivalent reactions in North Carolina and Iowa rural communities. This suggests that native perceptions of immigrants can be traced, in part, to immigrants' roles in local economies, including their participation in multiple livelihoods and their deployment of cultural labor. The contradiction between anti-immigrant sentiments and the need for immigrant labour can be understood as a reaction to increasingly precarious economic conditions facing both natives and immigrants in the twenty-first century and the changing values of productive and reproductive economies.

T1  - A Sometimes Hidden Economic Dimension to Individual Immigration Preferences: Cross-National Evidence in Support of the Labor Competition Hypothesis
AN  - 2315490820
AB  - This paper seeks to restore labor competition as an explanation for anti-immigration attitudes, recognizing that education may proxy both individual-level skill and cultural socialization. We thus need new tests to distinguish the effect of education based on skill from that due to socialization. If the education effect is consistent with these relationships, then we can have greater confidence that it is capturing the former and not simply the latter. This paper thus develops and conducts a new test, using data from the International Social Survey Program’s National Identity Survey fielded in 2013 across thirty-two countries. From a factoral framework, our test identifies three national-level factors that should influence how much labor market pressure lower skilled citizens feel from immigration: the quantity of immigrants, the direction of capital/investment flows, and the amount of trade protection. These national-level factors are interacted with individual-level education, showing that the attitudinal differences based on education increase with more immigrants but decrease with greater investment inflows and increased trade protection. These results demonstrate why this economic dimension may sometimes be hidden: in national contexts where there are few immigrants, capital follows labor, and/or there is trade protection, labor competition as a driver of anti-immigration preferences should lessen.

T1  - Repertoires of industrial conflict in a modern city. Lódz, Central Poland 1861-1921
AN  - 2306244190
AB  - This article examines the changing patterns of industrial conflict in a rapidly modernizing Eastern European city, focusing on a multi-ethnic industrial hub. I follow repertoires of contention in four crucial moments characterized by shifting scales of the geopolitical embeddedness of the city: (1) an early Luddite riot of 1861 in the Polish autonomous sub-state within the Russian Empire, (2) the first massive labor protest and the following pogrom of 1892 in the city already fully subsumed under the imperial governance, (3) a failed revolution of 1905 with a sophisticated feedback loop between party politics and street emotions, (4) mobilization practices during the German military occupation during the IWW culminating in the tram workers strike of 1917, (5) developing forms of industrial bargaining in the early Polish state after 1918. This broad picture spanning over 60 years (1861-1921) is grounded in the existing secondary literature, extensive queries of primary sources such as administration reports, court proceedings and petitions, and the analysis of political leaflets and biographical testimonies of the working class militants. Such a cross temporal comparison brings a broader outlook on the labor unrest in Russian Poland and beyond, which before was researched only in a fragmented manner.

T1  - Aspirations for Ethnonationalist Identities among Religious Minorities in Iraq: The Case of Yazidi Identity in the Period of Kurdish and Arab Nationalism, 1963–2003
AN  - 2389774436
AB  - The aspirations of religious minorities in Iraq for becoming recognized ethnonationalist entities have rarely been investigated from a historical perspective, particularly in the case of the Yazidis. This article addresses changing attitudes about the Yazidi religious minority identity across different historical periods. Yazidi identity is examined as an ancillary undercurrent to the ethnonationalist identity conflict between the central government of Iraq and the Kurdish movement. This contrasts with identity as a religious minority in prior eras, when religious minorities preserved their distinct core identities based on their own social and religious customs and idiosyncrasies, making them self-defining communities bound together by coherent religious identities. In the case of the Yazidi minority, despite the multiplicity of theories and hypotheses about the origins of the Yazidi people and their national and ethnic affiliations and increasing rumors about Yazidis related to their existence as a potential sub-ethnicity or ethno-religion, the important truth is that Yazidis consider themselves religiously, culturally, and historically distinct from other ethnonationalist groups and communities in Iraq.

T1  - Displacement contexts and violent landscapes: How conflict and displacement structure women's lives and ongoing threats at the Thai-Myanmar border
AN  - 2317026090
AB  - Chronic conflict and displacement carry consequences for personal and social violence. How is violence embedded in displacement-related histories and ongoing circumstances? How might it underlie social and health inequities in host countries? For addressing these questions, I offer a new approach to conceptualizing and measuring displacement contexts and the structural violence embedded therein. I present the empirical case of the Thai-Myanmar border. Myanmar's civil conflict has fueled one of the largest and most chronically displaced populations globally. Thailand's border population has consequently grown with people displaced from the varied conflict-related circumstances within Myanmar. I administered a novel survey in two sub-districts along Thailand's northern border with Myanmar in 2016–17. With data from 520 respondents, I used clustering of life events and circumstances to uncover displacement-related contexts and violence. I uncovered livelihood- and security-based threat contexts, which disproportionately affected ethnic minority women. Among women from Myanmar, past military occupation and acute violence co-occurred with unexpectedly low perceived past oppression-indicative of covert everyday violence. In contrast, women who fled home destruction or deprivation, but often less overt military violence, were more likely to perceive oppression. Women born in Myanmar also experienced acute potential violence at the border, including severe livelihood and security threats. These threats were most prevalent among women that experienced the most forceful and abrupt displacement. This study uses a person-centered perspective to characterize and measure violence embedded in displacement, including the structural violence against women that is perpetuated across displacement contexts and embodied over time.

T1  - Rueang Khong Faen Phleng (Story of Fans): Social Politics in the Vintage Thai Music Revival
AN  - 2316403676
AB  - From 2005 to 2015, an upsurge of interest in vintage Thai music recorded on 78 rpm records between 1948 and 1969 created a succession of vibrant yet short-lived online communities made up of collectors and fans, mainly focused on the traditionally working-class genre luk thung (Thai country song). This surge of nostalgia for luk thung from the 1950s and 1960s by middle-class professionals can be interpreted as a reflection of the social trauma purportedly experienced by Bangkok's middle class during a decade of class and ethnic-based political turmoil. These fan websites were characterized by obtrusive regulation, boom and bust price cycles, military-style ranking systems and conflict over status. Despite the seeming egalitarian aura of fandom and the Internet, and despite being set up as refuges from political turmoil, online communities such as baanfasai (clear sky house) ultimately reproduced the political and social disorder, disunity and chauvinism of the 'real' Bangkok.

T1  - Public spirit on immigration issues and tax morale in Italy: An empirical investigation
AN  - 2278882864
AB  - Tax evasion is undoubtedly a pervasive phenomenon likely to impact negatively on equity, social capital and social cohesion. A growing body of research has started to investigate the role of "tax morale," as the intrinsic motivation to pay taxes, in driving individual tax compliance decisions. Given the increasing anti-immigration sentiment among Italian taxpayers, triggered by recent continuous migrant inflows from North African countries, the aim of this paper is to shed light on the relationship between tax morale and public spirit on immigration issues. Drawing on the European Value Survey longitudinal dataset, a large-scale, cross-national and longitudinal survey research program on basic human values and belief systems among people in Europe, we derived an index capturing the degree of perceived threat from immigration inflows (IBTS) and a tax morale indicator (TM). Controlling for a set of widely investigated tax morale determinants, we found that the IBTS coefficient is always negative and statistically significant at the highest significance level. This means that an increase in the degree of perceived threat among taxpayers always crowds out tax morale, reducing their willingness to comply with the law.

T1  - Reflections on Grant Evans’ <i>The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975</i>
AN  - 2267647901
AB  - In this article I reflect on Grant Evans’ landmark and influential The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance: Laos since 1975, the way in which this book relates to the transformation from socialism to post‐socialism in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (LPDR), to the crisis of legitimacy of the communist regime, and to issues of social memory, Buddhism, nationalism, iconography, and ethnic minorities. I also consider how other scholars have engaged with The Politics of Ritual and Remembrance both critically and supportively since the publication of the monograph in 1998. I include in my analysis some observations on Evans’ quite radical change in political views over his career as a student, journalist and academic, culminating in his critique of socialism in general and the LPDR in particular and his controversial sympathy for the Lao monarchy.

It argues that the educational underperformance of second-generation students is to some extent a product of an inequality in different students’ abilities to materialise educational opportunities provided by the destination country’s education system. This inequality in abilities is generated by the human diversity of the different groups: immigrants vs. non-immigrants; voluntary immigrants vs. refugees. Depending on the integration context, the human diversity may exacerbate the inequality and cause the performance gap to get wider. The article uses data from two qualitative studies with the Somali community in Finland and employs the capability approach. Due to their background as the children of refugees from Somalia and the attitude of people in mainstream society, Finnish-Somali students face more challenges in materialising educational opportunities. The Finnish context in which they find themselves puts these students in a less encouraging position for two reasons. First, prejudice and discrimination may weaken their will and confidence to learn and reduces their parents’ will to cooperate with their schools. Second, their parents—due to their lack of knowledge of the school system and proficiency in the Finnish language—are also relatively less effective in the Finnish schooling system. To deal with the performance gap between immigrant and native children in schooling, public policy should focus on how the integration context is shaping diverse students’ abilities (capability sets) to succeed.

T1  - Ethnicity, nonviolent protest, and lethal repression in Africa
AN  - 2252080274
AB  - Why do governments use deadly force against unarmed protesters? The government’s threat perception may be a function of the mobilization potential of the opposition and/or the size of the ruling elite’s support coalition. Given the high salience of ethnicity in African politics, governments that depend on small ethnic coalitions will see peaceful protests as more threatening, as the opposition may be able to draw on larger numbers of potential dissidents and excluded groups. Alternately, governments with larger, more homogeneous ethnic coalitions will find nonviolent mobilization less threatening and will be less likely to respond with deadly force. Using the Social Conflict Analysis Database, we demonstrate that as the size – and to a lesser extent homogeneity – of the ethnic ruling coalition grows, governments are significantly less likely to use deadly force against nonviolent protesters. This finding is robust to several operationalizations of the size of the government’s support coalition, the inclusion of other measures of ethnic demographics, and estimators that account for the hierarchical nature of the data. Threat perception hinges not only on dissident tactics but on their demands, their mobilization potential, and their capacity to impose costs on the government. This article demonstrates that the size and composition of the government’s ethnic support base matters as well.

T1  - Varieties of Indigeneity in the Americas
AN  - 2427332829
AB  - We examine sources of indigenous identity in the two countries with the largest indigenous populations in the Western Hemisphere—Mexico and Peru. We find that the size of the indigenous population varies dramatically depending on the measure of indigeneity used, and that using multiple measures captures distinct modes of indigeneity. Using latent class analysis, we find that contemporary indigenous classification clusters around four types, which we characterize as Traditional Indians, Indigenous Mestizos, New Indians, and Non-Indigenous. Traditional Indians tend to be indigenous on virtually all indicators, and they are especially poor, dark, and rural. Indigenous Mestizos tend to speak an indigenous language, but self-identification as indigenous is tenuous. New Indians assert an indigenous identity despite their frequent lack of linguistic knowledge and close indigenous ancestry, and they are as urban, educated, and light-skinned as the Non-Indigenous. The analysis addresses sociological concepts of ethnic boundaries, assimilation, mestizaje, and symbolic ethnicity and discusses the implications of distinct modes of indigenous ethnicity.

T1  - Outgroup Contact, Anti-Foreigner Attitude, and Social Cohesion in the Caucasus: Evidence from a Population-Based Survey
AN  - 2302762888
AB  - A substantial literature has emerged examining the relationship between ethnic diversity due to immigration and social cohesion in the host country. Empirical evidence concerning this relationship, however, remains inconsistent, if not contradictory. Aside from rare exceptions, the bulk of evidence is also based on North American and European countries. The present study focuses on a novel empirical context: Georgia, a country located in the South Caucasus. Based on multilevel modeling of population-based data, it examines the associations between outgroup contact and attitude toward immigrants and two measures of social cohesion: generalized trust and civic engagement. Results show that net of controls at individual and regional levels, a negative orientation toward foreigners significantly predicts lower trust in generalized others. Frequency of outgroup contact, on the other hand, is positively related to civic participation. This linkage is also weaker in geographic areas with higher levels of anti-immigrant attitude. A major policy implication from this study is to encourage more intergroup contact through effective residential integration, amongst other measures.

T1  - Policing Memory in Bosnia: Ontological Security and International Administration of Memorialization Policies
AN  - 2131036859
AB  - Using a case from Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), this article seeks to uncover how structural division along ethnic lines and external pressures to adopt memorialization policies relate to ontological security seeking. To provide securitization of memory, external memorialization policies, understood as the offsprings of the growing organizational power of human rights ideology, are constantly clashing with the nationalist understanding and usage of memory because, through particular pretext of victim-perpetrator-bystanders, they displace deeply contextualized historical memory from its national setting. The securitization of memory is understood here as the part of ontological security which refers to the need of a political elite governing a sovereign polity to have a secure identity by maintaining distinctiveness and through routinizing their relationships with other polities. The main claims of this paper are twofold. Firstly: external attempts to secure memory are actually designed to secure the moral boundaries of those who impose and mandate the memorialization policies, meaning the international community, and not the Bosnians. Secondly, and closely interlinked with the previous claim: the attempt to enforce one set of memories may backfire—that is, fail to secure against the repetition of violence while also cementing divisions along ethnic lines. These ethnic divisions, thus continually mobilized, may then contribute to further conflict. Those claims are illustrated with three different realms of memorialization policies securitization in the case of BiH.

T1  - Ethnography and the Making of “The People”: Uncovering Conservative Populist Politics in the United States
AN  - 2227365671
AB  - The election of Donald Trump, the Brexit vote, and rise of conservative populism in countries around the world has led to an abundance of scholarship on populism and the white working class. Much of this work seeks to explain the underlying cause of this conservative populist politics, focusing on globalization and economic precarity, racism and anti‐immigrant sentiment, or failures of political leadership. Survey data and polling analyses, in particular, explain relationships between demographics, political opinions, and voting results. Though quantitative data on the social groups or activists most involved in populist politics are important, missing from this research are ethnographies of populism that explore how local, state, and national actors influence the meaning of “the people.” In this article, I will argue that ethnography is particularly well‐suited for exploring the coming together of local and national politics and the subtle ways that economic insecurity, racism, sexism, and Islamophobia intersect in the making of “hard working taxpayers” or “ordinary folks.” I draw from research in a predominantly white, former manufacturing town in central Maine to illustrate the significance of this ethnographic approach to populism.

T1  - Why size matters: Majority/minority status and Muslim piety in South and Southeast Asia
AN  - 2214948650
AB  - The differences in the socio-economic outcomes of majorities and minorities have been well studied in sociology. This article breaks new ground by investigating the effect on religiosity of majority/minority status in two Muslim-majority and two Muslim-minority countries of South and Southeast Asia. Religiosity is conceptualised as a multidimensional phenomenon. The article critically discusses this conceptualisation through an analysis of survey data. The findings show significant differences in the sociological profiles of religiosity in Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority countries. The architecture of religiosity is significantly more orthodox in Muslim-majority countries. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for understanding the nature and dynamics of religious orthodoxy, the nature of civil society, religious reform and the role of collective religious social movements.

T1  - The Role of Language in Anti-Immigrant Prejudice: What Can We Learn from Immigrants’ Historical Experiences?
AN  - 2302691511
AB  - Prejudice remains an unpleasant experience in immigrants’ everyday lives, especially for those of stigmatized groups. In the recurring struggle of various immigrant groups, historical and contemporary events reveal the important role of language in the creation, transmission, and perpetuation of anti-immigrant prejudice. Living in an anti-immigrant climate, immigrants are frequently exposed to stigmatizing language in both political and social discourse. This may be a more significant and frequent experience for immigrants since the beginning of the 2016 United States presidential election. Although it has long been understood that language is inextricably linked with prejudice, the investigation of the role of language in creating, transmitting, and perpetuating anti-immigrant prejudice remains undeveloped in social work research. This paper provides a theoretical explanation of anti-immigrant sentiment by discussing how stigmatization has allowed for immigrants to be subjected to various forms of prejudice throughout history. Building upon prior theoretical concepts of stigma, this paper argues that being an immigrant is a stigma. This paper reviews historical and contemporary cases of prejudice against immigrants to provide evidence for how stigmatizing language transmits and perpetuates anti-immigrant prejudice in the United States and building upon prior stigma theories, defines one’s status of an immigrant to be form of stigma itself. The paper concludes with a call for appreciable attention to the role of language in anti-immigrant prejudice and the need for social workers to advocate for immigrants within higher education and in our communities to reduce such stigma though social work practice, education and research.

T1  - Dynamics and Diversity in Epistemic Communities
AN  - 2177544169
AB  - Bruner (Synthese, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-017-1487-8) shows that in cultural interactions, members of minority groups will learn to interact with members of majority groups more quickly—minorities tend to meet majorities more often as a brute fact of their respective numbers—and, as a result, may come to be disadvantaged in situations where they divide resources. In this paper, we discuss the implications of this effect for epistemic communities. We use evolutionary game theoretic methods to show that minority groups can end up disadvantaged in academic interactions like bargaining and collaboration as a result of this effect. These outcomes are more likely, in our models, the smaller the minority group. They occur despite assumptions that majority and minority groups do not differ with respect to skill level, personality, preference, or competence of any sort. Furthermore, as we will argue, these disadvantaged outcomes for minority groups may negatively impact the progress of epistemic communities.

T1  - LANGUAGE POLICY IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA AND ITS ETHNO-LINGUISTIC CONTEXT: DO LANGUAGES CAUSE INTER-ETHNIC TENSION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA?
AN  - 2493533129
AB  - After the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991, the new independent state of Bosnia and Herzegovina was inundated by a horrible ethnic conflict, which led to inhumane violence and mass killings that ended with genocide. The Bosnian war resulted in the death of about 100,000 people, over half of whom were Bosnians. Two decades later, the violence has stopped, but the conflict in Bosnia has not yet come to an end; hasty social segregation, undertaken as a result of the 1995 Dayton Accords, which intended an immediate stopping of the violence, is still in force. The current distribution of population and languages is evidence of this segregation. Two different ethnic minorities live in two Bosnian political units, the Srpska Republic and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Serbs in the first and Bosnians in the second. In these circumstances, which are very sensitive, the government was recently worried that the ordinary publication of statistical data on ethnic groups might lead to violence. The languages representing these two groups are important indicators of social presence and power. Signboards in the main streets of the capital cities of both countries (Sarajevo in the Federation and Banja Luka in Serbian Republic) were scrupulously photographed for the purpose of assessing the presence of Serbians and Bosnians. The presence of the English language in Bosnia was also documented. An assumption was made that the linguistic majority would correspond to the ethnic majority in both main streets, and that English would be used in advertising. The number of photos in which each language was used was calculated to determine the frequency and the situations in which the languages are commonly used. An analysis of these results showed that English is the second most used language in both streets after Bosnian, while comparatively little presence of the Serbian language in both streets showed that the language environment in Bosnia does not facilitate peace and making peace.

T1  - An Inverted Quest: Cosmopolitanism and Religion in Baladeva Comics
AN  - 2343435928
AB  - As demonstrated by Benedict Anderson, media are powerful means in creating imagined community, and accordingly, mighty poles of both nationalism and cosmopolitanism. While the former gains much popularity in scholarly analysis, the latter needs to be considered as well, in understanding religious expression in present-day Indonesia, and both in particular with regard to the tensions of "nationalism" (often appeared in term of neo-tribalism and political populism) and religious transnationalism. The present article takes Anderson's insight and through it explores the rhetoric represented in the series of historical comic entitled Baladeva, published by Tantraz Comics Bali, Denpasar. The analysis sought inspiration from the notions of micro-cosmopolitanism and cosmopatriotism. A micro-cosmopolitanism is a cosmopolitanism from below that is concerned with freedom, openness, tolerance, and respect for difference, while cosmopatriotism is a double articulation of patriotism and cosmopolitanism that grapples with the condition of territorialism and de-territorialism in the context of postmodern society. Through those conditions and framing, the analysis might reveal the complicated meaning of cosmopolitanism, beyond the popular understanding of the celebration of being the global citizen and the transcendence of traditional and national boundaries. Taking the last period of the Medang Kingdom (Hindu-Buddhist Mataram) as the historical context of the comic's plot, the author consciously portrayed the glory and power of the pre-Islam, pre-colonial 'Indonesian' past. This narrative directly and indirectly became a critical position against the present condition of Indonesia, which is presumably Westernized, modernized, and implicitly Islamicized. Balinese socio-political and religious dynamic as the immediate context for the author is also part of the equation. Hence, the analysis might touch upon where the pressing questions of nationalism and cosmopolitanism, counter-transnational religious discourse, and religious minority are played out.

T1  - CHANGE IN THE PARTY SYSTEM FROM LIBERAL - TO ETHNIC-BASED POLARISATION - THE CASE OF MACEDONIA
TT  - SPREMINJANJE STRANKARSKEGA SISTEMA OD LIBERALNO DO ETNIČNO ZASNOVANE POLARIZACIJE - PRIMER MAKEDONIJE
AN  - 2272174256
AB  - Although party systems (PSs) have been studied a lot, there is still insufficient research into the transition from a PS characterised by the predominance of liberal-based political parties into a PS in which ethnicor religious-based parties dominate. The article helps rectify this deficiency by combining a quantitative approach using numerical measurements of PSs and a qualitative approach for determining the characteristics of PSs and how they change. This combination of approaches in the empirical study of the PS and the way it developed in Macedonia between 1990 and 2018 proved crucial for revealing the growing polarisation within the PS based on the stronger ethnic polarisation, an aspect uncapturable by the usual quantitative measurement of PS change.Alternate abstract:Navkljub obšírnemu študiju strankarskih sistemov so prehodi iz sistemov s prevladujoče liberalno zasnovanimi strankami v sisteme s prevladujoče etnično ali religiozno zasnovanimi strankami še vedno premalo raziskani. S člankom prispevamo k zmanjševanju tega manka na podlagi kombinacije kvantitativnega pristopa vključno z uporabo numeričnih mer za opis strankarskih sistemov in kvalitativnega pristopa za opredeljevanje značilnosti strankarskih sistemov in njihovega spreminjanja. Kombinacija obeh pristopov v empiričnem raziskovanju se je izkazala za ključno pri razumevanju dinamike strankarskega sistema v Makedoniji med letoma 1990 in 2018 in razkrivanju stopnjevanja polarizacije znotraj strankarskega sistema na podlagi medetnične polarizacije. Zgolj kvantitativni raziskovalni pristop z običajnimi merami spreminjanja strankarskih sistemov takšne spremembe ne zmore razkriti.

T1  - Current State of Interethnic Communication in Latvia and Estonia
AN  - 2188185167
AB  - The article shows the nature of inter-ethnic communication in modern Latvia and Estonia in the areas related to the implementation of identity of ethnic minorities. For the authors it was important to determine whether ethnic majorities (Latvians in Latvia and Estonians in Estonia) are ready to discuss the related issues. It was also important to realise whether Russians as the largest ethnic minority in these countries are ready to accentuate these issues in their communication with Latvians and Estonians. The authors relied on materials of two research projects, one in Latvia and one in Estonia. These research projects revealed a mixed assessment by the respondents of the values of ethnic minority identities in Latvia and Estonia, and thus the significance of inter-ethnic communication on the issues directly affecting the preservation and development of ethnocultural identities of ethnic minorities. The recognition of equality of people with different ethnic identities in various spheres of social life coexists with the recognition of different roles that collective ethnic and cultural identities of Latvians/Estonians and ethnic minorities play in the society. The current state of inter-ethnic communication in Latvia and Estonia suggests differences in the status of identities of ethnic majorities and ethnic minorities in public and political life and absense of policies to accomodate these statuses through an active interethnic diaolgue. There is a clear evidence of the collision of the proclaimed liberal principles and the existing ethnic division in Lativa and Estonia.

T1  - Refugees, ethnic power relations, and civil conflict in the country of asylum
AN  - 2170232032
AB  - Many countries that face forced migrant inflows refuse to admit these uprooted people premised on negative externalities such as increased insecurity associated with refugee presence. Also, the academic literature on civil conflict identified refugee movements as a factor contributing to the regional clustering of war. Case-based evidence suggests that refugees can disturb the ethnic setup in the country of asylum and thereby trigger instability. To enhance the yet limited systematic understanding of the role of refugees in violent conflicts, this study examines the linkage between forced migrants, transnational connections, and ethnic civil conflict in the country of asylum with a large-N analysis, 1975–2013, arguing that ethnic power politics in the asylum state are determinant for intrastate conflict onset after a refugee influx. Statistical analysis finds that groups are particularly prone to conflict if they are excluded from governmental power and simultaneously host ethnic kin refugees, because a co-ethnic refugee influx enlarges the demographic and political leverage of the kin group, possibly resulting in clashes with other groups in the country. Hence, refugees alone do not consistently influence armed violence – only in combination with political tensions in the receiving country. Therefore, host governments should pursue inclusionary policies towards their population, to prevent dangerous instability, instead of closing borders or blaming refugees for domestic problems.

AB  - Introduction Externalizing disorders are more prevalent in rural than urban settings and account for disproportionately high mental health service costs for rural adolescents. Although cultural stressors such as discrimination have been associated with externalizing problems in ethnic minority youth broadly, this relationship is understudied in Latinos, particularly those in rural settings. Further, though the associations of family processes such as familism and family conflict have been studied in relation to youth externalizing symptoms, whether these processes change in the face of adolescent discrimination stress remains unknown. Methods A moderated multiple mediation model was used to examine the association between perceived discrimination, externalizing symptoms, and the indirect effect of family factors (familism, and family conflict) in a large sample (n = 455) of rural Latino youth. We also evaluated whether indirect and direct effects of discrimination on externalizing symptoms differed in boys versus girls. Results Familism and family conflict each independently mediated the relationship between discrimination related stress and externalizing symptoms. However, discrimination had a direct effect on externalizing symptoms for boys only. In girls, this association held only when family factors were accounted for. Post-hoc analyses reveal that the moderating effect of sex on discrimination is driven by differences in rule-breaking behavior, as opposed to aggressive behavior. Conclusion Findings suggest that discrimination is associated with changes in the family environment which in turn invoke elevated risk for externalizing problems. Further, family-focused interventions that address externalizing problems may be especially effective for adolescent girls.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect of positive and negative online contact between groups involved in high-intensity conflict
AN  - 2170891467
AB  - Israeli Jews and Palestinians are involved in a high-intensity, overt, violent conflict, in which Israeli Palestinians can be considered a mediating group, which shares a citizenship with Israeli Jews and an ethnicity with non-Israeli Palestinians. The current research examines (1) the primary effects of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards the Israeli Palestinians; (2) the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes of the former toward non-Israeli Palestinians. The study was conducted through an online survey of 450 Israeli Jews aged 18–35. It revealed direct positive effect of online contact with Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards them, if this contact was defined by respondents as positive, and negative effect if the contact was defined as negative. We found evidence of STE of online contact with Israeli Palestinians (primary out-group) on attitudes toward non-Israeli Palestinians (secondary out-group) for positive contact, but no evidence of STE was found when the contact was negative. The relationship between the frequency of online positive contact with the primary out-group and attitudes toward the secondary outgroup was fully mediated by attitudes toward the primary, encountered out-group, namely, via a process of attitude generalization. This paper adds to a growing body of research on STEs of intergroup contact considering a previously unexplored STE of positive and negative online contact. The study revealed that the potential of Internet and online contacts might be used to increase solidarity and understanding within and between nations.

T1  - Does the superdiversity label stick? Configurations of ethnic diversity in Dutch class rooms
AN  - 2124337157
AB  - Superdiversity has become a popular term to depict the societal impact of migration in Europe, but does its heuristic value justify its popularity? The term superdiversity seems to be important to many scholars, but is it relevant to the lived experiences and applicable to the reality of migrants and non-migrants in societal institutions like education? This article aims to assess this heuristic value by applying superdiversity’s connotations to findings of 125 interviews with students and teachers of a Dutch university of applied sciences. The two different configurations of diversity found, i.e. commonplace diversity and essentialist diversity, question superdiversity’s heuristic value. First, students do not experience diversity as something exciting or ‘super’ or positive, as superdiversity authors suggest. Their main concerns, i.e. to enjoy education and to construct their identities in line with institutional demands, are not covered by the notion of superdiversity. Second, key descriptive meanings associated with superdiversity do not make sense to these configurations of diversity, i.e. discarding the ethno-focal lens and expectations of more or new and multilayered complexity. Findings point to conviviality, creolization, ethnic boundaries and groupism, not to superdiversity.

T1  - Action Research at the Intersection of Structural and Family Violence in an Immigrant Latino Community: a Youth-Led Study
AN  - 2089013902
AB  - The current study addresses the lack of research exploring the social and emotional impact of anti-immigrant policy on Latino communities, and the intersection of anti-immigrant climates with other family stressors, like domestic violence (DV). In this paper we describe a qualitative study led by the participatory action research group La Voz Juvenile de Caminar Latino. Youth researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with Latino men, women, and youth participating in a domestic violence program. Using an inductive approach to thematic analysis, researchers identified themes that reflect how Latino families with histories of DV experience an increasingly anti-immigrant climate. All participants in this study described emotional stress, fear, and restrictions in their day-to-day life attributed to the anti-immigrant sociopolitical climate, and adults also spoke to work-related stress and economic insecurity. Both adults and children described harassment by strangers, coworkers, and/or peers. With regard to DV, women tended to describe immigration stress as exasperating family conflict, while men viewed these external stressors as discouraging DV. Distrust of police and other formal supports was a key theme underlying adult and youth perceptions of help-seeking for DV. The findings of this study suggest that anti-immigrant sentiment and policy creates undue stress for Latino families and barriers to formal help-seeking for DV. The participatory research process provided a corrective experience for youth witnesses of DV and prioritizes the voices of those most affected by immigration policies and violence.

T1  - Describing the Politics of Sovereignty in Postcolonial Africa: Rereading Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o's Matigari and Alobwed'Epie's The Death Certificate
AN  - 2298155625
AB  - The 1960s in Africa are usually described by historians and political scientists as the era of the "wind of change" because it was during this period that most African countries gained political independence from their colonial masters. In fact, this "wind of change" gave African countries the legitimacy and legality to be the custodians of their own progress and destiny. However, the African continent since then has been a furnace for social revolution, ethnic conflict, and martial dissension. The reasons for this political uproar in most postcolonial African states are wide and varied. However, a principal reason is that the ruling African elites have confiscated the sovereignty of the postcolonial African state for their own individual benefits thereby leaving the masses in desperate conditions. This tragic situation is reflected in the literary and cultural discourses of post1960 Africa as seen in the novels of Ngügí wa Thiong'o and Alobwed'Epie. Using Ngügí's Matigari and Alobwed'Epie's The Death Certificate, this article analyzes the relationship between postcolonial African citizens and their political leaders and also shows how these leaders manipulate the dynamics of political or sovereign powers to the detriment of development in their societies. The article supports the view that the political leadership of the postcolonial fictional states, as seen in the novels, is the archetype of the misuse and abuse of state power in contemporary Africa. Using social semiotics as a theoretical paradigm, the paper affirms that postcolonial Africa is unprogressive, fragmented, and dismembered because of the mismanagement of political power for personal aggrandizement. This mismanagement of state powers has exacerbated the politicization of ethnicity in postcolonial Africa and is also responsible for the political tyranny, corruption, and ethnic conflict for which most contemporary African states have been noted.

T1  - Much more than airtime: radio strategies to foster an inclusive Latino identity in the Basque country
AN  - 2076977929
AB  - New opportunities for launching media projects targeting minority migrant audiences have emerged in the wake of international migration [Georgiou, Myria. 2001. "Mapping Diasporic Minorities and their Media in Europe. Studying the Media." A working paper for the EMTEL project "Diasporic Minorities and Their Media: A Mapping." http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/EMTEL/minorities/papers/]. However, most start-up enterprises in this category fail to develop effective strategies for establishing a dialogue between the minority audiences they serve and the native-born local populations. This paper, which examines the role radio plays in the integration of newcomers to the Basque Country, analyses the successful programming and outreach initiatives of Candela Radio in Bilbao, Spain, as well as the barriers to multiculturalism that must be overcome in complex societies like the Basque Country, in which deeply rooted traditions and values [Shafir, Gershon. 1995. Immigrants and Nationalists: Ethnic Conflict and Accommodation in Catalonia, the Basque Country, Latvia and Estonia. New York: State University of New York Press] are inextricably bound to language. The results of this qualitative study indicate that publically funded Radio Candela has not only managed to construct an audience that bridges the traditional gap between local migrant and native communities but is also actively fostering the development of a hybrid Latino-Basque identity.

T1  - The factor structure of a short acculturation scale for Filipino Americans in an adult U.S.‐born sample
AN  - 2054170640
AB  - The influx of non‐European immigrants since 1965 ushered the development and use of acculturation measures in immigrant health studies. A Short Acculturation Scale for Filipino Americans (ASASFA) represents a validated, unidirectional ethnic‐specific measure used with first‐generation FAs. ASASFA's psychometric properties with adult U.S.‐born children—the second generation—remain unexplored. This study determined (a) the factor structure of ASASFA with adult U.S.‐born FAs and (b) the predictors of their acculturation scores. A secondary analysis was conducted on ASASFA data from a mental health survey of 116 U.S.‐born FAs. Exploratory factor and parallel analyses showed a two‐factor solution: language use and preference (Factor 1) and ethnic social relations (Factor 2). Ordinary least squares regression indicated gender and ethnic self‐identification predict Factor 1 scores; self‐identification solely predicts Factor 2 scores. Results demonstrate ASASFA's validity and parsimony, supporting its use in FA health studies when lengthy bidirectional acculturation measures become impractical.

T1  - The Muddy Waters of Multicultural Acceptance: A Qualitative Case Study on Antisemitism and the Israeli/Palestinian Conflict
AN  - 2131780858
AB  - The Jewish peoples have endured thousands of years of discrimination and subjugation, yet during this new millennium, Jews and antisemitism are conspicuously absent from university ethnic studies classroom discourse in the United States. Those scholars, determined to penetrate the walls of the multicultural education stronghold, are met with an ebb and flow of silence and vociferous resistance. A primary rationale for multiculturalists ignoring antisemitism appears to be the Zionist question and how they, themselves, perceive Israel's relationship with Palestine. This qualitative case study analyzed interviews of six prominent scholars in the areas of multiculturalism, history, and Judaism through a critical pedagogical lens. Throughout this paper, the author explores his personal experiences in regard to educational multiculturalists and the dismissal of Jews as a persecuted group. From discourse analysis of themes and recurrent meanings in the data, it is evident that the majority of study participants believe that Israel's behavior toward the Palestinians is unacceptable, yet that does not justify the large-scale generalizations of the Jewish people in the United States. As a result, this paper argues for the inclusion of the Jewish experience into university multicultural discourse.

T1  - Looking into the Past to See the Future? Lessons Learned from Self-Management for Economies in Post-Conflict Societies of the Former Yugoslavia
AN  - 2088005340
AB  - Even though it was largely ignored in interventions after the 1990s conflict, the experience of post-World War II socialist Yugoslavia can offer useful directions for better understanding the ways in which economy can contribute to peacebuilding. The economic system, based on self-management achieved remarkable socio-economic development, as well as unprecedented of levels of inter-ethnic cohesion. This article argues that even with many limitations of the system, workers' participation in decision making and opportunities for socialising through the workplace were crucial for the role that the economy played in fostering inter-ethnic cohesion in the country.

T1  - The tie that divides: Cross‐national evidence of the primacy of partyism
AN  - 2023180993
AB  - Using evidence from Great Britain, the United States, Belgium and Spain, it is demonstrated in this article that in integrated and divided nations alike, citizens are more strongly attached to political parties than to the social groups that the parties represent. In all four nations, partisans discriminate against their opponents to a degree that exceeds discrimination against members of religious, linguistic, ethnic or regional out‐groups. This pattern holds even when social cleavages are intense and the basis for prolonged political conflict. Partisan animus is conditioned by ideological proximity; partisans are more distrusting of parties furthest from them in the ideological space. The effects of partisanship on trust are eroded when partisan and social ties collide. In closing, the article considers the reasons that give rise to the strength of ‘partyism’ in modern democracies.

T1  - White Nationalism in Congress and Gatsby
AN  - 2491993285
AB  - Now, more than ever, we need to find a way to be sure that all of the diverse students we teach can engage in difficult conversations in our classrooms about racism, religious prejudice, and white nationalism. These conversations, however, can be risky work in our current political climate, particularly as higher education is identified by critics like AttorneyGeneral Jeff Sessions as an "echo chamber of political correctness" (Ruiz 2017). We would argue that many of our great canonical American texts offer us remarkably interesting material with which to enable conversations about inequality and injustice in the United States and that teachers must seize the opportunity to use these texts to foster these conversations in our classrooms.1 We offer the following discussion of The Great Gatsby as a model for undertaking this important work.

T1  - Diversity, Conflict, and Recognition in Hospital Medical Practice
AN  - 2015463647
AB  - The hospital is a place of encounter between health care providers, patients and family members, the healthy and the suffering, migrants and non-migrants, as well as social and cultural minorities, and majorities of various backgrounds. It is also a space where multiple conceptions of care, life, quality of life, and death are enacted, sometimes inhibiting mutual understanding between caregivers and the cared for, a scenario that in turn may provoke conflict. Through the lens of conflict, we explore in this article the theme of Otherness within the clinic, basing analysis on an ethnographic study conducted in recent years in three cosmopolitan Canadian cities. Daily practices and—on a larger scale—the social space of the clinic become material here for reflecting on recognition (and non-recognition) of the Other as actors in the clinical encounter. The examination of structural and situational conditions that contribute to the emergence of conflict offers an understanding of the diversity of values that pervade the clinic. By way of conclusion, we argue that recognition of diversity, at least on the part of practitioners, is a key condition for the emergence of a pluralist normativity in the social space of the clinic.

T1  - The New Wave of Mobilisation in Kashmir: Religious or Political?
AN  - 2009772298
AB  - The intractability of the Kashmir conundrum continues despite the success of counter-insurgency operations carried out by the Indian state which can be seen in militancy levels climbing down since the early 2000s. While in part, this is because India and Pakistan are unable to break new ground on Kashmir, a key factor is that alienation still runs deep among Kashmiri people despite duly elected governments being in place. It does not help when their anxieties are further stoked by religio-political mobilisation, such as the Amarnath land agitation in Jammu in 2008, when Hindutva forces enforced a blockade of essential supplies to the Kashmir Valley. A spate of protests have since wracked Kashmir with stone-pelters confronting security persons who use disproportionate violence to quell them. Though each street protest, whether in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2013 or 2016, had a different trigger, the underlying restlessness and alienation are constants which pose a very real danger of breeding anarchy. This article seeks to explore whether this new wave of mobilisation in Kashmir is religious or political or both in nature, its causal factors and how it is different from the armed insurgency that erupted in 1989. It contends that the state must address and fix such alienation urgently to prevent things going further downhill in the Valley.

T1  - The systematic study of how subtle forms of bias related to prosocial behavior operate in racial and gender relations
AN  - 1991122341
AB  - Psychological research and theory have traditionally focused on bias and conflict between separate groups. Our central thesis is that the processes that shape hierarchical group relations within a society are distinctive and typically operate in ways that are frequently subtle rather than blatant. The challenges of detecting new subtle forms of bias are receiving considerable attention in the field of social psychology, internationally. Although explicit hostility toward minority groups seems to have faded in modern societies, cross-cultural data show that the status, resources, and the power of women and ethnic/racial minorities remain unequal. The present literature review integrates the findings of cross-cultural research showing the role of paternalistic legitimizing ideas and behavior for establishing, maintaining, and reinforcing group hierarchy and the disadvantage of members of traditionally underrepresented groups. Specifically, we explain how intergroup helping relations can be used as a mechanism to maintain social advantage in racial and gender relations. These theoretical and experimental insights help illuminate the dynamics of relations between socially linked groups and the nature of contemporary bias. We also highlight how this perspective suggests novel and productive directions for future research.

T1  - Ethnic boundaries and everyday understanding: The case of Malay and Chinese parental choice of National and National Type School in Peninsular Malaysia
AN  - 2488682285
AB  - Since the pre-independence era, the Malaysian schooling system has remained ethnicized by two cultural boundaries: language and religion. To explain this situation, this article focuses on how these ethnic boundaries work within Malay and Chinese parents’ decisions for National and National Type of Schools, respectively. Thirty Malaysian Malays and 25 Chinese students born between the 1970s and the 1990s were interviewed in this research. The data showed that the majority of them had been enrolled in a primary and secondary school which could be associated with their ethnic identity. Analysis of the findings also suggested that despite the importance of future career planning, regionality and family socioeconomic background in the choice of schooling, it was the language and religious factors which had determined their parents’ final decision. It also suggested that a schooling pattern based on the factors of language and religion has been sustainably maintained for three decades. The parental decision was not a simple action as it is also related to the ‘everyday’ understanding of what kind of school is appropriate to a particular ethnic group. The results of this study offer a theoretical explanation of ethnicity in everyday life from the constructivist perspective. This study also highlights how ethnic boundaries are the end-product of a social process rather than a taken-for-granted, natural and primordial fact of life ascribed through birth.

T1  - "The world's best minority": Parsis and Hindutva's ethnic nationalism in India
AN  - 2051179118
AB  - There is an assumption that nationalist movements which are constituted by an ethnic majority are hostile towards all minorities, so how does one account for such a movement's affection for one minority and hostility for another? In this paper I explore this question using the case study of a Hindu nationalist movement in India called Hindutva which simultaneously expresses hostility towards Muslims and affection for another minority known as the Parsis. I argue in societies that imagine themselves as plural there is a type of nationalist thought premised upon the existence of both exemplary and threatening minorities. An exemplary minority is imagined as loyal and acculturating, illustrating both how a minority should relate to the majority and why other minorities are threatening. While an historical argument enables the distinction between the majority and minorities, a plural hierarchy of minorities is enabled by mythical stories of coexistence and conflict.

T1  - THE ETHNIC DIMENSIONS IN SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
AN  - 2003019179
AB  - This article draws on work in the social construction of race and ethnicity to explain why racial/ethnic divisions are so often axes of domination and why these divisions are central to social movements. Racial/ethnic groups are constructed in political processes that are intertwined with state formation and social movements. Processes of state formation and collective action create racial/ethnic groups, define majorities and minorities, and create racial/ethnic structures of domination. Physical and social segregation in tandem with intergenerational inheritance creates network cliquing that reinforces group boundaries, group differences, and group interests. Movements by members of dominant racial/ethnic majorities differ from movements by members of subordinate racial/ethnic minorities in key ways, including access to democratic processes for achieving group goals, experience of repression, need for allies, identity construction, processes of consciousness raising, and bases of mobilization. These “ethnic dimensions” matter for all social movements.

T1  - Decomposing the Household Food Insecurity Gap for Children of U.S.-Born and Foreign-Born Hispanics: Evidence from 1998 to 2011
AN  - 1933465220
AB  - Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-K, multivariate analysis, state fixed effects, and regression decomposition, we examine changes in food insecurity for Hispanic kindergarteners between 1998 and 2011, a time period of rapid immigration and political/socio-economic changes. During this time the household food insecurity gap between children of U.S.-born and foreign-born mothers increased by almost 7 percentage points. The factors--child, family, and state--that contributed to the nativity gap differed over time. In both periods, lower familial resources among immigrant families, i.e. endowment effects, contributed to the gap; this was the main component of the gap in 2011 but only one component in 1998. In 1998, heterogeneity in state effects was positively associated with the nativity food insecurity gap. This means that children of foreign-born mothers experience higher household food insecurity than do children of U.S.-born mothers in the same state, even after controlling for child and family characteristics. In 2011, almost half of the gap remained unexplained. This unexplained portion could be driven by differential effects of the Great Recession, growing anti-immigrant sentiment, and/or the relatively large share of unauthorized immigrants in 2011.

AB  - This paper investigates the predictors of natives' perception of the immigrant threat in Romania, an interesting site given immigrants' marginal presence in the total population and the sizeable proportion of co-ethnic immigrants. Yet the interplay between nationalism and religion shapes an ideological frame that favours unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants that challenge the Romanian identity forged along ethnic and religious ties. The authors used regression to analyse immigrant threat according to several dimensions: cosmopolitanism, group conflict and intergroup contact. In order to reflect specificities of this particular context, the latter dimension is conceptualized so as to include active and passive contact with immigrants. This distinction is relevant because of immigrants' low presence in Romania. Findings suggest that variables from conflict theory explain more of the variation in the perceived threat, while indirect contact through mass-media exposure to immigrant content has the potential to reduce the perception of immigrant threat.

T1  - Violence and the Crisis of Meaning in a Neo-Liberal World
AN  - 2097835880
AB  - The struggle for meaning is central to human existence. Beyond material needs meaning offers purpose and hope to our lives. The present context of our existence is now shaped by the powerful influence of global capitalism which disrupts the communal bonds of traditional communities leaving an atomized individualism in its place. In the more developed world capitalism offers a shallow and endless desire for more things, a technocratic rationality that speaks only of efficiency and productivity, and a culture that erodes communal solidarity with an invidious competitiveness among individuals. Schooling, in the main, reproduces and reinforces subjects’ desires, beliefs and values of a neo-liberal world-view. It defines education in ways that connects it to jobs and conformity to the culture of capitalism. Little there now speaks to a civic culture and the dispositions of a critical democracy. Within this global context it becomes possible to understand the way that autocratic religious beliefs or aggressive forms of nationalism and ethnic identity emerge to provide alternative cultures to satisfy the human demand for meaning and purpose. Each constructs imaginary communities of meaning that offer narratives of purpose and connection among individuals. Of course such communities are ones connected around a binary understanding of the world in which others are viewed as enemies who seek their destruction. The author suggests that education now has an immense responsibility addressing this existential global crisis in ways that affirm the human need for meaning and community but in ways that are reparative of our collective and environmental bonds.

T1  - Janus-faced nature of colorblindness: Social dominance orientation moderates the relationship between colorblindness and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 1929388540
AB  - Colorblindness is a popular diversity ideology promoted as a means to intergroup harmony in ethnically diverse nations. While some research suggests that colorblindness reduces intergroup bias, other work suggests that colorblindness may increase it. The present research utilizes a national sample of European New Zealanders to examine whether the relationship between colorblind endorsement and outgroup attitudes is moderated by perceivers' individual differences in social dominance orientation (SDO). Data revealed that for participants low in SDO, colorblind beliefs predicted more negative attitudes toward ethnic minorities. However, for those high in SDO, colorblind beliefs predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities. Taken together, these findings suggest that colorblindness is not all good or bad for intergroup relations--instead, its effects may depend on perceivers' own egalitarian sentiments.

T1  - Nationalism, Ethnic Identity, and Jews in the Socialist Ideology of Otto Bauer
AN  - 1899818289
AB  - This paper examines the ideas of Otto Bauer (1881-1938) on national identity as a theoretical concept, the nationalities question in the Habsburg Monarchy, and the concept of a civic Austrian national identity. Additionally, it demonstrates that the experience of assimilation in Bauer's family background affected most directly the way he wrote about Jewish identity, and finds that some of his writings reveal a degree of doubt about his own identity as a German.

T1  - Acculturation of Indian Subcontinental Adolescents Living in Australia
AN  - 1892535457
AB  - Objective 
The aim of this study was to explore the preferred acculturation strategies adopted by Indian subcontinental adolescents living in Australia. The study also examined the demographic, ethnocultural, and psychological factors that could influence subcontinental migrant groups' attitudes towards acculturation and their acculturation strategies. 
Method 
A cross-sectional design was used in which the dependent variables were the four acculturation strategies. Multivariate data analysis was conducted. Pearson's correlation, analysis of variance, and step-wise multiple regression analyses were performed to establish the relationships among the study variables. 
Results 
Integration was the most preferred strategy and marginalisation was the least preferred strategy for all ethnic groups. Acculturation preferences are predicted partly by the adolescents' ethnicity, their ethnic identity, friendship choices, acculturative stress, sense of mastery (self-concept) and gender. The findings provide significant information on the acculturation practices of Indian subcontinental adolescents, including their ethnic identity search and commitment, their psychological well-being and their integration strategies. 
Conclusions 
Educational institutions could benefit from increased awareness of the needs of these culturally diverse groups, especially if this information is incorporated into teacher training materials. The inclusion of intercultural relations courses in the academic curriculum would promote harmonious relations between culturally diverse ethnic groups.

T1  - Russian nationalists in the Komi Republic: a case study of the Frontier of the North
AN  - 2697558391
AB  - The article examines some generic traits of the “new” Russian ethnic nationalism, namely, de-ideologization of the nationalist milieu and its inclination for civic activism. It results from a case study of the Frontier of the North (FN – Syktyvkar), an ideologically ambivalent organization that combines dual Russian/Komi ethnic nationalism, anti-migration sentiments, white racism, and fragments of other ideologies. The article demonstrates that, unlike nationalists of the previous generation, FN is not hostile to public authorities and is ready to cooperate with them. FN's grassroots activism, as well as sports and healthy recreational activities, attracts young people. The organization tackles the most acute social problems, often neglected by everyone else, and has become a working civil society institution. The authors argue that these tactics win the “new” nationalists sympathy among ordinary people and makes the groups politically stronger and more influential than the previous nationalist generation. However, state anti-extremist policy hampers the advancement of nationalists into mainstream politics.

T1  - Conflict about Natural Resources and the Prospect of Development in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
AN  - 2110228761
AB  - As a departure from the general debate on the nexus between natural resources endowment and conflict in Africa, which focuses on the authoritarian nature of African states, the rise of ethnic militias, corruption and the policies and activities of foreign oil multinationals, the objective of the paper is to trace and explain the cause of conflict and underdevelopment in DRC as a product of history. Using secondary data and a qualitative analytical framework, the paper argues that the prevailing conflict on natural resources in DRC has its roots in colonial history. It found that, as in the past, there are state and non-state interests behind the exploitation of natural resources whereby groups and citizens excluded from the accumulation process resort to violence. The paper then suggests the deployment and utilization of indigenous knowledge and practices with modern approaches to the resolution of conflict and management of resources in the country.

T1  - The identity crisis in Jordan: historical pathways and contemporary debates
AN  - 2697556834
AB  - This study aims to identify the attempts to form a Jordanian national identity from the establishment of the Jordanian state in 1921 to date. This study reviews the efforts of the Jordanian state, which was subject to internal, external, political, social, economic, and cultural circumstances, and variables that led to change the Jordanian national identity to incorporate religious, national, regional, ethnic, and tribal aspects. The regime has been unable to address and resolve the issue of national identity; instead, it has tried several means to circumvent the problem of national identity. The identity card is a means that the regime has used to achieve its goals. These policies led to the state's failure to define, establish, and maintain a comprehensive national identity for its citizens. The formation of a national identity has been a dilemma for Jordan since the establishment of the state; there is almost no known national identity. This situation calls for the construction of the Jordanian national identity on a fixed and clear basis to prevent its disintegration, to facilitate the process of social integration, and to build a final national identity that is both inclusive and representative. Without this identity, division and conflict may prevail in Jordanian society.

T1  - “Oil and Water”? Latino-white Relations and Symbolic Integration in a Changing California
AN  - 2406943817
AB  - Existing research on race relations between racial/ethnic groups in the United States highlights how personal contact can lead to increased harmony or conflict between groups and may reduce intergroup prejudice. This study engages this literature and draws from more than 20 months of ethnography and 66 interviews in a Spanish/English dual-language school in Los Angeles to qualitatively examine Latino-white relations in diverse settings. Interactions between Latino and white adults of varying class statuses are characterized by politeness and civility, yet parents segregate within the school and rarely form meaningful cross-racial relationships that transcend the campus. Despite regular interpersonal contact, a shared goal of bilingualism, and shared class status for some, divisions between Latino and white parents persist, and interactions between them are characterized by what the author terms symbolic integration. Symbolic integration refers to polite, but surface-level, interactions between racial/ethnic groups that are enjoyable, voluntary, and additive. This type of integration nuances our understanding of race relations and elucidates how sustained regular contact and the absence of negative racial stereotypes do not ensure lessened racial stratification between racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - The global-local negotiation: between the official and the implemented history curriculum in Israeli classrooms
AN  - 2008935275
AB  - Globalisation and technological advances in the twenty-first century have caused a blurring of national lines, which in the past were the basis of a nearly indisputable model of civic identity. This process has led to a noticeable trend of the globally oriented pressures within the national curricula, on top of the existing locally oriented demands. By employing an interpretative, qualitative methodology, this study offers a multidimensional analysis of the tensions and power relations within the global-local nexus in history teaching. We reveal and discuss Israeli teachers' perceptions and behaviours regarding the tension between the global and local inclinations within four major themes: teachers' entrepreneurial performance, critical views of the existing curricula, the presence of Israeli-Palestinian conflict throughout teaching involvements, and the meaning the teachers attribute to Holocaust in their teaching. The context for this study is Israel: a developed OECD country locked into an intense and long-standing ethnic and political conflict. The tension between the 'global' and the 'local' in the Israeli education system, studied through the prism of teachers themselves, provides a thought-provoking case study.

T1  - Friends or foes? Migrants and sub-state nationalists in Europe
AN  - 2076973760
AB  - How do sub-state nationalists respond to the growing presence of cultural diversity in their 'homelands' resulting from migration? Sub-state nationalists in Europe, in 'nations without states' such as Catalonia and Scotland, have been challenging the traditional nation-state model for many decades. While the arguments in favour of autonomy or independence levelled by these movements have become more complex, sub-state nationalist movements remain grounded by their perceived national community that is distinct from the majority nation. Migration to the 'homeland' of a sub-state nation, then, presents a conundrum for sub-state elites that we label the 'legitimation paradox': too much internal diversity may undermine the claim to cultural distinctiveness. We engage with three common intervening variables thought to influence how sub-state nationalists confront the 'legitimation paradox': civic/ethnic nationalism, degree of political autonomy, and party competition. Our overarching argument is that none of these factors have a unidirectional or determinate effect on the sub-state nationalism-immigration nexus, which is why the nuanced case studies that comprise this Special Issue are worthwhile endeavours.

T1  - Ethnicity, class, and civil war: the role of hierarchy, segmentation, and cross-cutting cleavages
AN  - 1787041569
AB  - Why are some countries prone to ethno-nationalist conflict, whereas others are plagued by class conflict? This is a question that has seldom been raised and rarely been examined empirically. This paper presents a social-structural theory to account for the variable incidence of these two forms of political instability. These two types of conflict result from distinct principles of group solidarity - ethnicity and class - and since each individual is simultaneously a member of an ethnic group (or many such groups) and a particular class, these two principles vary in the degree to which they are mutually exclusive or cross-cutting. The degree of economic stratification between groups and economic segmentation within them shapes the relative salience of each principle of group solidarity in any society and is associated with a characteristic form of political mobilization. In places where between-group inequalities are high, and within-group inequalities low, ethnicity should be the dominant principle of group solidarity and serve as the primary basis of group conflict. By contrast, in countries where between-group inequalities are low, and within-group inequalities high, class is more likely to serve as the dominant principle of group solidarity, and conflicts along class lines are more likely. We test these conjectures with data in over 100 countries on cross-cutting cleavages, ethnic war, and class conflict. The results are supportive of the theory, and provide evidence that how groups are stratified and segmented in societies shapes the type of civil war.

T1  - The Forfeiture of Nationality in France
AN  - 1812283364
AB  - This article aims to speak about the silenced effects of the forfeiture of nationality (i.e., denaturalization) through an analysis of the French law on denaturalization. The article argues that this law produces a principle of unequal citizenship and generates a differentiated understanding of national identity, through which French-born nationals enjoy an irrevocable right to nationality, whereas newly arrived nationals only have access to a conditional national identity. What are the effects of such division? And what does it tell us about the politics of national identity? Following a Foucauldian genealogical approach, the analysis reviews the effects of French former President Sarkozy's speech in Grenoble on July 30, 2010, arguing that his discriminating views pertaining to nationality are not only a feature of contemporary politics of security and anti-immigration sentiments, but instead correspond with a differentiated approach to nationality that has been in play since the early 20th century.

T1  - Identity and acculturation: interethnic relations in the Basque Autonomous Community
AN  - 1784145812
AB  - This study analyses the influence of ethnic identity on the acculturation orientations of Basque undergraduates, towards groups in traditional contact (native Basques and native Spaniards) and towards recent immigrant groups. Five dimensions were used to measure the Basque and/or Spanish identities: linguistic, cultural, political, global, and the desire to be Basque and/or Spanish. Two factors were identified by analysing the factor structure of the items: Basque and Spanish identity. The scales of both factors were dichotomised using the mid-point of a 7-point Likert-type scale. The subjects were classified, according to their scores on identity scales, into three prototypes: two polarised identities, Basque and Spanish, and a third Dual prototype merges both identities. The main aim is to compare the host acculturation orientations of the three prototype identities towards different groups. The differences in acculturation were small in regard to immigrant groups, although orientations were more negative towards groups of immigrants who are less highly regarded by the host society. Interestingly, the prototypes differ in the acculturation orientations regarding the groups in traditional contact, the native Basques and native Spaniards. An in-group favouritism effect occurs, in both polarised prototypes, whereas the Dual prototype shows similar positive acculturation orientations towards both groups.

T1  - Changing livelihoods, gender roles and gender hierarchies: The impact of climate, regulatory and socio-economic changes on women and men in a Co Tu community in Vietnam
AN  - 1772857317
AB  - This paper examines the combined impacts of climate, regulatory and socio-economic changes on gender relations in an ethnic minority community in Central Vietnam. Climate and regulatory changes have caused food insecurity because farming production has significantly declined and hunting and exploiting forest resources have been strictly controlled, affecting livelihood activities. Along with food insecurity, pressures created by social changes and men's reduced contribution to livelihood activities have forced women to adapt and move toward the cash economy, increasing their workload and responsibilities. Although there are positive changes in terms of women's status and greater economic role, these changes may also bring about tensions regarding gender roles and conflict within the family during this transitional phase. In conclusion, some policy recommendations are offered toward more gender-equal responses to the new challenges facing both women and men in a rapidly changing environment.

T1  - Befriending the enemy: Outgroup friendship longitudinally predicts intergroup attitudes in a coexistence program for Israelis and Palestinians: GPIR
AN  - 1752001292
AB  - One of the largest Middle East coexistence programs annually brings together Israeli and Palestinian teenagers for a 3-week camp in the United States. For 3 years, we longitudinally tracked how this intervention affected Israelis' and Palestinians' relationships with, and attitudes toward, each other. Specifically, we measured participants' outgroup attitudes immediately before and after camp, and, for 2 years, 9 months following "reentry" to their home countries. In all 3 years, participants' attitudes toward the outgroup improved from precamp to postcamp. Participants who formed an outgroup friendship during camp developed more positive feelings toward outgroup campers, which generalized to an increase in positivity toward all outgroup members. Although the positivity faded upon campers' reentry, there was significant residual positivity after reentry compared to precamp. Finally, positivity toward the outgroup after reentry was also predicted by outgroup friendships. Future contact interventions may profit from encouraging individuals to make and maintain outgroup friendships. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/72.abstract]

T1  - Invisible victims? Where are male victims of conflict-related sexual violence in international law and policy?
AN  - 1731797406
AB  - In this article the author argues that men and boys have been historically and structurally rendered an invisible group of victims in international human rights and policy responses towards conflict-related sexual violence stemming from the United Nations. The apparent female-focused approach of instruments on sexual violence is criticized followed by a discussion -- through analysis and interviews with legal scholars and champions for the recognition of male survivors' experiences -- of the first 'emergence' of male victims in these instruments and key actors involved in this process. The existing serious dichotomy between visible and invisible victims is prominently based on their 'gender identity' and leads to structural discrimination of male victims of rape or other forms of sexual violence. To overcome this situation and develop more inclusive instruments, a reconceptualization is needed of the meaning and use of words like 'gender' and 'gender-based violence'. Additionally, a more intersectional approach to sexual violence should be adopted, understanding that victims have a multitude of identities such as ethnicity or religious affiliation that make them particularly vulnerable to suffering.

T1  - Everyday Nationalism: Constructivism for the Masses*
AN  - 1705245602
AB  - Objective 
We argue that the "everyday nationalism" approach is both useful and necessary for improving existing constructivist approaches in the comparative study of nationalism and ethnic politics. 
Methods 
A meta-analysis of existing studies reveals pervasive conceptual and methodological problems of contemporary constructivist approaches. We consider the implications of replacing individuals or groups with ethnic or nationalist practices as units of analysis. 
Results 
Everyday nationalism promises to address the gap between constructivist theory and the methodological individualism of existing studies. This approach proceeds from ethnographic observation and utilizes methods reliant on observing societal interaction or relational meaning making for verification. We illustrate such a research strategy using examples of nationalist legitimation in authoritarian regimes and the ethnicization of economic development. 
Conclusion 
The everyday nationalism approach promises to overcome the shortcomings in much contemporary constructivist work. The potential for developing qualitative data sets of nationalist or ethnic practices further promises to complement constructivist insights.

T1  - How Does the Majority Public React to Multiculturalist Policies? A Comparative Analysis of European Countries: PROD
AN  - 1676465148
AB  - Migration and ethnic minority integration remain heavily contested issues in numerous European countries. Over the past decade, researchers and political commentators have observed an apparent retreat from multiculturalist policies related to a belief that multiculturalism has lost support among the majority public. Recently, however, based on analyses of the evolution of migrant integration policies, it has been demonstrated that multiculturalist policies were largely left in place. To investigate the effect of multiculturalist policies on public opinion, we use a multilevel analysis of three policy indicators (Multiculturalism Policy Index, Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants-Cultural diversity, and Migrant Integration Policy Index) and European Social Survey data in 20 European countries. Results show that multiculturalist policies, as measured by Multiculturalism Policy Index and Index of Citizenship Rights for Immigrants-Cultural diversity, and migrant integration policies more generally, as measured by Migrant Integration Policy Index, to some extent are associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments, while they do not affect public attitudes toward political institutions. Regarding political attitudes, especially respondents with higher education levels tend to respond in a more positive manner to multiculturalist policies than respondents with lower education levels.

T1  - Cultural and religious demography and violent Islamist groups in Africa
AN  - 1752995456; 201600268
AB  - This research explores the relationship between cultural demography and Islamist violence in Africa in a cross-national time series study. It argues that while religious demography can explain some aspects of Islamist violence, these explanations have to date been privileged over analyses which take into account the way institutional and political relations of the state incentivize and de-incentivize the salience of particular identities in collective action. This paper uses disaggregated conflict event data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Dataset (ACLED) to test the relationships between religious group size, diversity, ethnicity and Islamist violence. The results highlight that approaches to explaining Islamist violence emphasising the cultural specificity of Islam as particularly prone to violence, and those focusing on competition between diverse identity groups as explanations for the rise of Islamist violence are misguided. Rather, ethnic political power relations emerge as important interacting factors in religious identity conflict, with Islamist violence as an example. The article makes an original contribution both empirically, by testing existing theories of Islamist violence on previously unanalysed data; and theoretically, by highlighting the importance of political marginalisation and strategic identity construction as explanations for violent Islamist activity.

T1  - Contesting and complying: gender and ethnicity among Thai-Sikh diaspora youth in Bangkok
AN  - 2570342015
AB  - The Thai-Sikh diaspora community is prominent in Bangkok. The youth of this community struggle to maintain their ethnicity while simultaneously trying to fit into the multi-cultural society in Thailand. Literature at the intersection of diaspora, ethnicity and migration notes that ethnic boundaries take on a very important role among migrants. Uncut hair and religious practices are seen as markers of Sikh ethnicity, while control over young girls’ movement and sexuality, teaching Sikh traditions to the young and eating traditional food are used to ensure ethnic purity. This study looks at Thai-Sikh youth in international schools in Bangkok, a world far removed from that of their parents. The study found that young girls and boys rebel against some markers, while complying with others. Specifically, boys rebel against physical markers such as uncut hair, while girls rebel against social markers such as control over their sexuality achieved through control over movement, clothing, marriage and freedom to work away from the family. Both boys and girls seek to strike a balance between tradition and modernity by contesting and complying with ethnic boundaries in different ways even if the implications of these ethnic markers are drastically different for each group.

T1  - Electoral coordination in Anglophone Africa
AN  - 2115183615
AB  - Electoral coordination has been a primary concern for scholars of African politics, interested in topics such as ethnic conflict mitigation and democratisation, for decades. However, understanding of micro-level electoral coordination in Sub-Saharan Africa is generally still very limited. This study is the first to investigate voter coordination in Sub-Saharan Africa using constituency-level election results. Studying 20 single-member district elections during the period 1990-2010 in five Anglophone African countries (Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi and Zambia) demonstrates that many African elections continue to show low levels of electoral coordination. Using a multi-level regression analysis, the study shows that the most important explanation for low levels of coordination across Africa is high voter volatility. It is argued that insufficient information makes it hard for voters and candidates to act strategically. However, the level of democracy, which has been emphasised in earlier aggregate level research, does not significantly affect the level of coordination.

T1  - Cultural Complexity and Border Markers in Norwegian Kindergartens
AN  - 1448995003; 201344054
AB  - This article has analysed practices towards and views on cultural diversity by staff in two Norwegian kindergartens. The article has focused on food traditions both among minorities and the Norwegian majority that serve as border markers and are used in differentiating processes among the staff. The analysis found concurrent processes towards cultural homogenisation and increased diversity and experienced that staff members are in the process of developing a perception about minority children that is complex, shifting and intersecting, rather than a straightforward perception based solely on minority status. However, the study also identified a tendency operating in parallel where, even though the ideal goal is equality in results, the outcome in practice is often a majority-based equality practice that leaves little room for difference.

T1  - Examining Lijphart's favourable factors for consociational democracy: Guyana
AN  - 2120225356
AB  - Since the late 1950s, the competition for state power under a Westminster majoritarian system in Guyana between Indo-Guyanese (East Indians) and Afro-Guyanese (Africans/Blacks) has produced social conflict, political instability and intermittent inter-ethnic violence. Unsurprisingly, it has long been proposed that the country's ethnic problem could most effectively be solved through the establishment of a government of national unity or executive power-sharing. Passions, prejudices and political calculations, however, dominate the 'academic' debate, resulting in a research void on the applicability of power-sharing models to Guyana. In particular, Lijphart's consociational democratic model has been considered suitable for Guyana with only infrequent attempts to explore its empirical and theoretical implications. This paper assesses how Guyana measures up against Lijphart's nine factors favourable for the emergence and maintenance of consociational democracy, demonstrating that Guyana possesses the majority of these. This positive overall score suggests that a government of national unity could be viable. Nevertheless, executive power-sharing has not materialised. Some inhibiting factors are discussed.

AB  - This article explores the ways in which a fifth-grade class of Greek Cypriot students and their teacher perceived and negotiated the meanings of empathy for the "other" in the context of ethnic conflict in Cyprus. The findings suggest that the process of engaging with empathy is full of fractures and failures, possibilities and impossibilities. Children's emotional ambivalences to empathize with the "other" are embedded in the politics of conflict, yet there are also moments of transcendence. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Russia's Dual Social Structure: Resource Allocation within the Feudal System
AN  - 1700675438; 201525443
AB  - Russian society has a dual structure. On the one hand, the state has created formal professional castes, to which it allocates resources based on the principle of welfare-state distributive justice. On the other hand, there exist informal 'corporations'. Politics in Russia revolves around the conflict between these two principles of order. On one side are those who want to allocate resources according to the principles of a deeply socialist caste society; on the other side are the members of different regions, sectors, concerns, clans, or ethnic groups who want to see resources allocated according to the unwritten 'rules' of a fluctuating hierarchy of these 'corporations'.

T1  - 'Unity in Diversity': Non-sectarian Social Movement Challenges to the Politics of Ethnic Antagonism in Violently Divided Cities
AN  - 1315601470; 201308833
AB  - Divided cities are defined by a violent conflict of ethnonationalism and characterized by semi-permanent ethnic cleavages, high levels of endogamy and social segregation. Yet the perception that divided cities are wholly framed by the politics of ethnic homogeneity is challenged by a number of its citizens who refuse to be interminably circumscribed by ethnic politics. These 'actors' mobilize in social movements that promote non-sectarian politics and identities. They also include the protests of environmentalists, trade unionists and the celebrations of gay groupings. This article critically explores how such urban social movements may help ameliorate or contest the politics of ethnic antagonism in divided cities. It explores this issue in the context of debates regarding peacebuilding projects in divided cities, especially those that promote accommodative solutions to ethnic conflict, and shows how social movement mobilization may augment political power sharing. Focusing on non-sectarian social movement mobilization in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the article critically analyses movements in three ways: creating intercommunal networks; fostering a public sphere of debate; and challenging the programmed uses of segregated space.

T1  - National Identity and Immigration Policy: Concern for Legality or Ethnocentric Exclusion
AN  - 1347781312; 201322169
AB  - Does support for tough policies against undocumented immigration reflect anti-immigrant sentiments or a neutral concern about upholding laws? This study addresses the question by examining the relationship between different expressions of national identification and ethnocentric enforcement bias-that is, support for punishment of law-breaking immigrants but not law-breaking American employers who knowingly hire undocumented immigrants. Results revealed an association of this enforcement bias with nationalism (an ethnocentric engagement with national identity) but not with patriotism (a more critical engagement with national identity). A moderation analysis indicated that the relationship between nationalism and ethnocentric enforcement bias was most evident among participants who endorsed a "culture"-based construction of American identity in terms of American citizenship and ability to speak English. Discussion focuses on policy developments that reflect a symbolic threat to culture-based constructions of American identity and on the implications for fair and just enforcement of immigration policy.

T1  - Challenges in conflict management in multi-ethnic states – the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and Serbia and Montenegro
AN  - 2697553288
AB  - This article examines the break-ups of post-communist Czechoslovakia and the Union of Serbia and Montenegro under consociationalism. According to Arend Lijphart, social divisions may be neutralized at the elite level with power-sharing mechanisms. Lijphart's theory has been abundantly criticized, particularly because, while its intention is to induce cooperation, consociationalism does not give leaders actual incentives to cooperate. Czechoslovakia and the Union qualified as consociations; however most favorable factors were absent. The states failed to overcome their divisions and broke apart. Both states were going through a democratization period, experienced differently in each republic. The article argues that the application of consociationalism at this time magnified the divisions. Stirring up the ethnic sensitivity of the population was the most reliable strategy for politicians to secure popular support. In this context, and with the EU enlargement prospect, the consociational structure, instead of bringing elites together, weakened the federal power and provided elites the opportunity to defend republican interests at the expense of the federations. Hence, while a consociation requires certain conditions and favorable factors, the context in which consociationalism is implemented, and particularly democratization periods, may have a decisive influence on the leaders’ ability to cooperate, on their decisions, and thereby on the state.

T1  - Multiculturalism and the challenge of pluralism
AN  - 887499262; 201119704
AB  - Today we can identify two challenges of pluralism: the ever-growing conflicts between religious, national and ethnic groups on the one hand and the oppression of dissenting individuals by their respective communities on the other hand. Both intercommunitarian and intracommunitarian conflicts find their origin in a communitarian conception of our political, cultural, or religious identities. After presenting some of the problems of the communitarian solution in particular with regard to the challenge of internal pluralism, I introduce alternative conceptions of multiculturalism that consider our commitments to be part of our personal or individual identity. Distinguishing a conception of identity based upon self-knowledge from liberal, postmodern theories (Richard Rorty) and alternative non-cognitive theories (Bernard Williams) that consider identity to be individual in nature, I propose that the awareness of the individual nature of commitments makes it possible for us not to impose our values upon other individuals who do not share them while at the same time justifying the multicultural project.

T1  - 'Deeper hegemony': the politics of Sinhala nationalist authenticity and the failures of power-sharing in Sri Lanka
AN  - 1417523174; 201333086
AB  - Through a case study of Sinhala nationalism and its impact on ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka, this article explores the idea that the study of ethno-national conflict management as well as the wider field of nationalism studies tends to render nationalism as epiphenomenal and explicable through other underlying political and socio-economic dynamics. The article contends that nationalism studies need to take on board lessons learnt in the social sciences from ontological, post-Gramscian and Foucaultian studies of power that do not disqualify nationalism as a channel for political mobilisation. In the case of the literature on Sinhala nationalism in Sri Lanka, the predominant tendency has been to explain these dynamics as a consequence of elite instrumentality. In contrast, what is contended here is that it is the 'deep hegemony' of Sinhala nationalism, demonstrated in the mobilisation of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, that has impacted profoundly on the recurrence of ethnic conflict and the consistent failure of attempts to broker peace.

T1  - Including Oneself and Including Others: Who Belongs in My Country?
AN  - 1928619308
AB  - To be a full member of a country, must one have citizenship, the same ethnic or racial background, or the same religion as most citizens? What do people of different statuses believe about the criteria for inclusion? To answer these questions, the authors analyze the 2003 International Social Survey Programme survey on national identity, focusing on ten wealthy, democratic countries. They find a series of mismatches. A strong sense of being included is often coupled with a desire to exclude others. Countries with extreme public views are not always the countries with political controversy over inclusion. Views of citizens or members of the mainstream religion or race often differ from views of relative outsiders. Countries often cluster in ways that violate standard assumptions about geographic, cultural, or political affinities. Enjoying high status does not guarantee feeling included or seeking to include others. Given these mismatches, it is no surprise that politics and policies around inclusion are contentious, unstable, and fascinating.

T1  - Religious conflict in Kano: what are the fundamental issues?
AN  - 881461044; 201116888
AB  - Focusing on outbreaks of religious violence in Kano from 1991, it is clear that 'how, when and why' such violence occurs is complex, with ethnic and religious identities inter-connecting with other dimensions within society, polity and economy. In attempting to explain and understand the multidimensional reasons for such violent outbursts, four possible factors that may trigger violence can be identified: socio-economic problems; weaknesses of state mechanisms in dealing with potential clashes; religious rivalry and radicalisation; and external factors. Ultimately, conflict will end when all groups realise they have little to gain from the exercise, but before that can happen a fundamental reassessment of the relationships between politics and society in Nigeria is required.

T1  - Understanding the Significance of the Teenage Mother in Contemporary Parenting Culture
AN  - 1926268296
AB  - This paper attempts to understand the prominence given to teenage pregnancy in policy discussions since the late-1990s by contextualising it within a broader analysis of the contemporary 'culture of parenting'. The emerging field of parenting culture studies has begun to develop an analysis of the key features of policy, practice and informal culture. Three key concepts are discussed to shed an alternative light on the issue of teenage pregnancy and parenthood with the hope of further developing the healthy debate that has emerged in recent years in response to policy priorities: the development of 'parental tribalism' whereby differing parental choices and behaviour become a site for identity formation; the idea of a deficit at the level of parenting and intimate familial relationships; the reconceptualising of the parent as an autonomous, authoritative adult to a more infantilised imagining. The teenage mother, herself neither adult nor child, becomes emblematic of these developments.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives’ Opinions toward Immigration in North Carolina<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558423079
AB  - This article compares native residents’ opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties – one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents’ tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - Latino Parents' Choice of Magnet School: How School Choice Differs Across Racial and Ethnic Boundaries
AN  - 1928228038
AB  - Historically, magnet schools have served predominantly Black and Anglo populations. Consequently, little research exists on Latino parent's engagement in school choice and their patterns of participation. Magnet schools are increasingly part of the landscape for improving school achievement for all students. Yet Latino enrollment rates in magnet schools fall short of their representation within most urban populations as well the population as a whole. This article explores the factors that influence Latino parents' participation in magnet school choice. The findings show that Latino parents who participate in school choice come from vastly different educational backgrounds, tend to be solidly middle income, are either second-generation immigrants or are married to one; the social networks of the most educated Latino parents do not include people with access to magnet schools. This study holds policy implications for similar cities in the new Latino South that are shifting to unitary status.

T1  - Context, evidence and attitude: The case for photography in medical examinations of asylum seekers in the Netherlands
AN  - 754037760; 201051984
AB  - Can photographs of scars serve as evidence of torture? Amnesty International's Medical Examination Group in the Netherlands (AI-MEG) has, for more than a decade, been photographing torture scars to supplement the testimonies of asylum seekers who have been denied refuge. AI-MEG only intervenes at this point, when asylum seekers face extradition. Proving allegations of torture is of vital importance, as asylum seekers face rising anti-immigrant sentiment in European countries. All victims examined by AI-MEG present a combination of mental, physical and emotional scars. We summarize five cases where AI-MEG used photography in their medical examinations, and consider the ethical role physicians play in helping asylum seekers obtain refuge. Though photographs cannot capture all forms of trauma, as visual documents, they are a compelling form of concrete evidence of torture. In this way, photographs complement verbal testimonies and help doctors and immigration authorities to see and understand physical scars left by various forms of torture. AI-MEG explains in medical terms the connections between the visible late sequelae of torture and victims' testimonies. They then assess whether or not the physical scars are consistent with the forms of torture recounted by victims, using the terminology of the Istanbul Protocol (1999), the United Nations-adopted manual of guidelines that explains how to document torture. This paper outlines the medical examination process and argues for the use of photography as medical evidence on behalf of asylum seekers. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - British Muslims and the UK government's 'war on terror' within: evidence of a clash of civilizations or emergent de-civilizing processes?
AN  - 743046591; 201034909
AB  - In the immediate aftermath of the September 2001 attacks on America, defending civilization was quickly established at the core of the 'war on terror'. Unintentionally or otherwise this incorporation of civilization connected with Samuel Huntington's 'Clash of Civilizations' thesis. Within the 'war on terror' the dark side of counterterrorism has become apparent through international practices like extrajudicial killing, extraordinary rendition and torture. The impact of Western governments' policies upon their indigenous Muslim populations has also been problematic but social and political analysis has been relatively limited. This paper seeks to help address the scarcity of sociological contributions. Hidden costs of the UK government's attempts to utilize violence and enhance social constraints within the nation-state are identified. It is argued that although counterterrorism strategies are contributing to a self-fulfilling spiral of hatred that could be considered evidence in support of the 'Clash of Civilizations', the thesis is unhelpful when trying to grasp the underlying processes. Instead the paper draws upon Norbert Elias's application of the concepts of 'civilizing' and 'de-civilizing' to help improve levels of understanding about the processes and consequences of particular Muslim communities being targeted by security forces. The paper concludes with an exploration of the majority of the population's acquiescence and willingness to accept restraints upon Muslims in order to safeguard their own security. Adapted from the source document.
