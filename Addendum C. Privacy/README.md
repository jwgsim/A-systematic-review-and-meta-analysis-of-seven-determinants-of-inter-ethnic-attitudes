### Addendum C. Privacy.

Data protection impact assessment: This study does not make direct use of personal data. The data used in  this study originates from the research articles in the form of the articles themselves, text data from these articles, or aggregate data in the form of coefficients. Within reason, it is impossible to directly trace  this information to any individual, above and beyond what one would be able to trace from the original research articles themselves. As such, no privacy issues are identified.

Informed consent was not a relevant factor during the data collection. 

The research archive is to be stored on the Github page of the corresponding author, J.W.G. Simons.
